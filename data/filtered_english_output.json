    "content": "GaadiWaadi - Force Gurkha is priced at Rs. 13.59 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi), and it’s the sole rival to the extremely popular Mahindra Thar Last month, Force Motors had launched the Gurkha BS6 in the Indian market. Deliveries of the SUV have now begun across the country. The manufacturer has not revealed the exact number of bookings it has received for the 2021 Gurkha, but we believed that the SUV will likely find a lot of success in our market. Force Gurkha only has one direct rival in India – Mahindra Thar. The current-gen Thar was introduced a year ago in our market, and it has enjoyed a lot of success since then. Mahindra has received upwards of 75,000 bookings for the Thar, but due to production constraints, the company hasn’t been able to fulfil these orders. Currently, the waiting period for the Thar goes as high as a year! Force Gurkha thus seems like a brilliant alternative, as buyers wouldn’t have to wait a year to take delivery! Also, the new Gurkha is much better than the older model, featuring better creature comforts and offering more convenience and safety features, while still maintaining the rugged charm of the original. Ashutosh Khosla, President of Sales and Marketing at Force Motors, had this to say: “We are delighted with the response to the all-new Gurkha across the country. Even before the vehicles arrived at the dealership, customers have booked the Gurkha seeing the positive feedback. We already have enough bookings to cover the supplies for the next three months.” Under the hood of the new Gurkha is a 2.6-litre turbo-diesel engine, which generates a peak power of 91 PS and a maximum torque of 250 Nm. It comes mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox and a 4×4 system. The latter gets manually-locking front and rear differentials, along with a low-ratio transfer case. Force Motors has confirmed that it will launch a 5-door/long-wheelbase version of the Gurkha soon. The 5-door version will have the same styling as the current 3-door version, and the powertrain will likely be the same as well. The interior space, however, will be better, than the existing one. The final details are under wraps at the moment.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alex Bauer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Alex Bauer -- Investor Relations Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to TriNet's 2021 third quarter conference call. Joining me today are Burton M. Goldfield, our President and CEO; and Kelly Tuminelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared remarks were pre-recorded. Burton will begin with an overview of our third quarter operating performance. Kelly will then review our financial results. We will then open-up the call for the Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion will include our 2021 fourth quarter and full-year guidance, and other statements that are not historical in nature or predictive in nature or depend upon or refer to future events or conditions such as our expectations, estimates, predictions, strategies, beliefs, or other statements that might be considered forward-looking.

With that, I will turn the call over to Burton for his opening remarks. Burton? Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Alex. TriNet's third quarter operating and financial performance was once again exceptionally strong. This continues a multi-quarter trend which sets us up for a solid performance in the fourth quarter. On today's call, I would like to discuss three important topics. First, I am very pleased with our Q3 financial performance, to which I will provide highlights. Next, I will discuss positive factors impacting the PEO construct in general, as well as TriNet specifically. The PEO construct is particularly well positioned to address systemic changes to the nature of work due to the pandemic. Additionally, ongoing legal and regulatory challenges impacting SMBs are efficiently supported using this model. And finally, I will highlight our inaugural environmental, social and governance report released this afternoon. This report provides visibility into the central role ESG plays in TriNet's corporate culture and how we consider the needs of all of our stakeholders. During the third quarter, TriNet delivered a premier HR experience and our customers continue to grow dramatically as they have throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Bureau of Labor and Statistics recorded slowing job growth relative to expectations in the third quarter, TriNet saw our customers at new hires at a rate substantially higher than our forecast. Our operating and financial performance was highlighted by strong professional service revenues growth and strong WSE volume growth. During the third quarter, we grew total revenues 18% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Additionally, when we compare our 2021 third quarter total revenues growth to that of the 2019 third quarter total revenues growth, total revenues grew 18%. This comparison highlights the strong underlying performance of TriNet's business throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Professional service revenues delivered year-over-year growth of 24%. The growth in professional service revenues was attributable to the following items. WSE volume growth, especially in our core white-collar verticals, technology, financial services, and life sciences and strong growth in PEPM rate. The percentage increase also benefited from a recovery credit program accrual taken in Q3 of 2020, which did not repeat in Q3 2021. Kelly will address these highlights later in greater detail. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share grew 142% year-over-year to $1.16 per share. I am very pleased with our Q3 earnings performance. We beat our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.44 and when compared to our third quarter of 2019 GAAP EPS, a pre-pandemic quarter, we grew our earnings per share by 49%, again, demonstrating both our overall growth and our growth in profitability throughout the pandemic. During the third quarter, we grew our ending WSE count 10% year-over-year to approximately 351,000 WSEs. This also represented a 3% sequential growth versus our second quarter of 2021, demonstrating momentum across our business. This TriNet all-time high ending WSE volumetric was the continuation of recent growth trends. Our customer selection process has resulted in a customer base comprised of dynamic and durable companies. This was led by the technology vertical where we continued to see strong hiring throughout the quarter. Furthermore, our Main Street vertical has finally recovered all of its lost CIE since the onset of the pandemic, indicating further normalization in the broader economy. Finally, sales contributed positively for the second straight quarter. Our new sales growth focuses on our core verticals and is adding to our already strong and amazing customer base. Let's talk for a minute about the PEO industry in general. As we look to the future, the PEO construct is well-positioned for continued share growth within the SMB space. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, PEO has played an important dynamic role which has reinforced for me our industry's growth potential. At the onset of the pandemic, PEO's aided business owners has together renavigated the economic uncertainty. Our ability to administer HR services from the cloud enabled customers to successfully transition their workforces to fully remote. As the economy slowed, we walked our customers through workforce management, for example, helping them balance furloughs versus layoffs. As policy makers established the PPP loan program, PEOs went to work assisting customers throughout the process. In fact, according to NAPEO, the PEO Industry Association, PEO customers were 71% more likely to have received a PPP loan which speaks to the industry's ability to help customers source and organize the information required for the PPP application. This is an excellent example of how scale and expertise from a PEO made a significant business impact at that critical moment in the COVID crisis. At a more macro level, the same recent polling by NAPEO found that the PEO customers are 82% more likely to have their business operations back to normal or better than before the COVID pandemic. As we look to the future and learn how to co-exist with COVID-19, new operational complexities have emerged for SMBs and we as an industry and TriNet specifically are well-positioned to assist SMBs navigate these new complexities. Last month at our second annual TriNet PeopleForce Conference, one topic repeatedly discussed was the emergence of hybrid workforces. Hybrid work defined as employees working part time on-premise and part time at home is being normalized and held as an example of a permanent change in the future of work. For SMBs, this work construct introduces new operating complexities with respect to HR services, tax and culture. TriNet is well-prepared to continue to assist SMBs in the transition to this new way of work with our multistate HR services. Our focus is to ensure that our multistate, multi-location customers remain compliant under the different state and local regulatory regimes. This move to hybrid work is spotlighting our services as the SMB market demands more of these services. As employees shift to working from home and the office, often these locations are not in the same city and sometimes not in the same state. Furthermore, many SMBs are using the pandemic to reconsider their headquarter locations. Each of these new trends introduce tax complexities among other challenges. Taken together, resource constrained SMBs are facing significant obstacles to remain compliant. Additionally, when the headquarters change, medical plans, rates and carriers may change because many medical plans are determined by the state in which your headquarters resides. TriNet helps navigate this complexity. By enabling HR access from anywhere, TriNet is working with employers to keep employees connected. Furthermore, through our robust benefits offering, employers can demonstrate their appreciation for their employees. I look forward to the evolution of the US workforce and supporting them as they adapt to this new and incredibly exciting world. Turning to the topic of ESG, we released our first environmental, social and governance report this afternoon. I have spoken in the past about our efforts to consider the interest of all our stakeholders. Through this report, our stakeholders will see the deep commitment made by TriNet to our work, customers, colleagues, the environment around us and our shareholders. 2021 is the perfect time for our team to showcase the work we've done. We aim to provide a new level of transparency into how we operate and view our role with respect to all stakeholders in our company. While we are pleased with our progress, we know we have more work to do to reach our ideals as articulated in this report. We view our ESG report as a public report card to establish a benchmark and we look forward to updating you on our progress against this benchmark. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kelly for a more detailed financial update. Kelly? Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Burton. I'll review our third quarter financial results before discussing fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Our third quarter financial performance was strong. WSE volume growth exceeded projections and drove top line growth. Health performance remained benign and our operating expenses came in line with expectations, which taken together, drove bottom line outperformance. During the third quarter, total revenues increased 18% year-over-year, outperforming the top-end of our guidance range by 1 point. The outperformance in total revenues was driven by 10% year-over-year growth in ending WSEs and 9% year-over-year growth in average WSEs and continued high health participation by RWSEs. Once again, year-over-year growth in total revenues included a 5% benefit from last year's accrual for the Recovery Credit Program, which reduced revenues in the third quarter of 2020. This prior year accrual impacted both professional service revenues and insurance service revenues. Professional service revenues in the quarter grew 24% year-over-year, exceeding the top-end of our guidance range by 4 points. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, our year-over-year average volume growth of 9% reflected strong hiring. More than half of it came from our technology vertical. While the volume of hiring has moderated from last quarter, it was much more robust than we had predicted when we updated our third quarter guidance. We also again benefited from retaining our strong customers, but we are seeing this trending more in line with historical levels and anticipate that continuing as we emerge from the pandemic. Second, professional service revenues benefited from 11% growth in rate. Similar to last quarter, rate growth saw a meaningful contribution from our efforts to achieve a minimum price with our smallest customers to align with the cost to serve those clients. We may benefit from this trend for one or two more quarters. For the third quarter, our insurance cost ratio was 86%, outperforming our forecasted range for the quarter of 89.5% to 91.5%. The outperformance of the insurance cost ratio versus our estimate was largely due to two factors; first, the surge of the COVID Delta variant early in the quarter once again reduced elective procedures, particularly in the Southeast. Second, we benefited from catch-up contributions related to COBRA, which reduced insurance cost ratio by approximately 0.5 point. Related to our operating expenses, we were roughly in line with guidance that had some year-over-year shifts in our marketing spend, given the timing of PeopleForce in the third quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year. In addition to PeopleForce, we invested in additional branding to support our Finserve preferred product launch and other brand awareness and lead generation going into our busiest selling season as well as had higher sales commissions. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 25.2%. In the quarter, we saw higher state tax remittances offset by differences arising from employee-related equity compensation. GAAP net income per share increased 142% to $1.16 compared to $0.48 per share in the same quarter last year, exceeding the top-end of our guidance by $0.44 and adjusted net income per share increased 134% to $1.31 compared to $0.56 per share in the same quarter last year, which also exceeded the top-end of guidance by $0.44. So far this year, we have spent $94 million to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares of stock and have over $264 million of authorization remaining. We also generated $334 million in corporate operating cash flows through the first three quarters of the year as a result of our strong operating performance ending the quarter with $525 million in corporate cash. Overall, performance in the third quarter continued many of the positive trends we saw emerge in the first half and we are positioned well for the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our 2021 fourth quarter and full year outlook. I will provide both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenues growth of 12% to 14% year-over-year and professional service revenues growth to be in the range of 16% to 20% year-over-year. This guidance builds on our higher base of WSEs and reflects seasonal trends in sales and attrition. In the fourth quarter of last year, we accrued $24 million in total for our 2020 Recovery Credit Program, which reduced both fourth quarter 2020 GAAP total revenues and professional service revenues by 2%. Regarding our insurance cost ratio or ICR, we are expecting our fourth quarter ratio to be between 92% and 94%. An ICR of 94% captures a diminishing impact from the COVID-19 Delta variant and a return to more normalized health utilization, while an ICR of 92% contemplates a continuation of the status quo. The overall higher insurance cost ratio range also reflects our normal typical pattern of higher utilization in the fourth quarter, as more participants have satisfied their deductible layers and our pooling benefits have reset. We expect fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.40 per share and we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.60 per share. Regarding our full year 2021 guidance, given three quarters of performance and our better than expected volume, we are raising our full year guidance. We are now forecasting our year-over-year GAAP revenue growth to be 11% to 12%, lifting the bottom-end of the range by 1 percentage point. With the strong growth to-date and our fourth quarter outlook, our full year professional service revenues forecast is now for 15% to 16% year-over-year growth, an increase of 1 point to the top-end of the range. We expect our full year 2021 insurance cost ratio to be in the range of 86.5% to 87%, a 1 percentage point improvement to the top-end of the range, as revenues are expected to remain strong while utilization remains subdued relative to historic and expected future experience. With all of these factors taken together, we now expect GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.43 or up 5% to up 11% year-over-year. The new GAAP EPS range represents an increase to the top-end of the range of $0.40. Adjusted net income per share is now expected to be in the range of $4.88 to $5.12, an increase of $0.42 versus our previous guidance and representing year-over-year growth of 10% to 15%. With that, I will return the call to Burton for his closing remarks. Burton? Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Kelly. As a recap, Q3 was a very positive quarter for our company. We achieved strong growth in WSE volume, professional service revenues, total revenue, PEPM rate and margin expansion. This continues a multi-quarter trend, which sets us up for a solid performance in the fourth quarter. As we wrap-up this call, it is important for me to reiterate how we continue to execute our strategy. We target the right customers in our core verticals. We deliver a premier HR experience. We offer our customers outstanding benefits, and we operate with integrity as described in our ESG report. I have always said, complexity is our friend. As a result of the pandemic, SMBs are facing more, not less complexity. TriNet is well positioned to capture more market share in the coming months and years to help SMBs address these complexities. Finally, I would like to thank the entire TriNet team for delivering these results. With that, I will now turn it over to the operator. Operator? Questions and Answers: Operator We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Thank you. Thank you, Burton and Kelly. I wanted to ask first on the WSE count or on the volume side. Obviously, great results again there. Just trying to think about that result in all of your comments Burton just around the PEO with the secular growth. So with the change in existing, I know that labor market is hot, especially in tech and I know you had the recovery credit program going on as well. So I'm just trying to understand how much of this is just hot market versus something different you're doing from a tech perspective or a servicing perspective and also just to tack it on thinking about PEO in general, is there a risk that as some of these tech firms get larger that they may graduate out of the PEO and same with the higher PEPM rate in the down-market? Could that also cause an uptick in churn? Just trying to think about how to go beyond the fourth quarter and into the midterm in terms of the WSE count. Thanks. Sorry. I had a lot out there in one question. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer No. Thank you, Tien-Tsin and it is a great question. It was an incredible quarter from my standpoint. The customers are thriving in this environment and your question is a good one. What I am seeing is that the ability to offer the high-end benefits, the 401k, the flex spending accounts, the paperless onboarding. These customers, particularly tech customers are fighting for the scarce talent that's out there, the programmers, the strategy folks, and we're helping to get them on-board. So I was, as I said, in my remarks, I am thrilled with the growth of the installed customer base and I'm also happy with the net new sales. So all-in-all, in the verticals we are playing in, there is strong demand, I believe for PEO in general and TriNet specifically. Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Yeah, no, it's been smart to go up to those verticals for sure. I'll ask a quick follow-up then maybe to Kelly on the insurance cost ratio. Just if you don't mind on insurance cost ratio, 92% to 94% guidance in the fourth quarter, that's up 1 to 3 points over the prior year, but up quite a bit sequentially, I don't think it's ever been up that much sequentially, but I know that Delta and everything else is unusual. So talk to us about the visibility there. Why would that be up so much sequentially [Speech Overlap] Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Tien Tsin. Happy, to answer that question. Well, one thing I want to just remind you is sort of the pattern we see seasonally. We typically see seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter because people have worked through their plan, deductibles and our guidance just reflects that seasonality. We also have our pooling limits on a per employee or per member basis that actually reset at the beginning or at the end of October. And so really the -- or I'm sorry, at the beginning of October. So fourth quarter, we would have a reset of all those pooling limits. So anything over $500,000, we will be on the hook until they hit those pulling limits for high-class claimants. I do believe that we'll see a normalization of healthcare utilization. We were definitely under this quarter and we expect to see that regular normalization, but we don't necessarily contemplate a spike in it. Was that helpful? Tien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Yeah. Got you. Thank you. Good results there guys. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, thanks. Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Operator Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great, thanks. And let me add my congratulations as well. Hey, can you remind us in terms of vertical mix today, how much is technology versus maybe some of the other verticals and then where the average client size sits and as you have more of a distributed workforce, does that change classifications of workers or the average PEPM per WSE, maybe just components as to what the new world looks like post-COVID, as opposed to prior as we think about the model. And then if you could maybe on retention, I know there's a lot there, but just how you're thinking about retention longer term as well. Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Kevin, let me take that. This is Kelly. Kevin McVeigh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hey, Kelly. Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer In terms of tech, it is our largest vertical. So when we look at all of our verticals, it is our largest. We don't give percentages, but it's our largest single vertical. And when I think about the change in existing or hiring in the quarter, then that hiring was actually up about 7%. So just quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 7% increase in the tech vertical, just given the strength there. Our average size of client, I think we're right around 21, so it's still relatively small. You asked about a distributed workforce and does that change our pricing? We currently do not distinguish pricing based on the level of distribution of our workforce at this point in time. And then on retention, I think that was your last question. And then I'll make sure I was responsive. But on retention, we are seeing people now focusing on the back-end of the house. They were during the period of deep COVID really not focusing on back office and trying to make sure they could keep their businesses surviving, but we are seeing a little more retention, but just really back to historical levels. I wouldn't say it's elevated. Kevin McVeigh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Thank you. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Kevin. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead. Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Andrew. Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst Thanks for taking my questions. Just first one was just on kind of the success of the sales season to-date. I know you're kind of getting into the heart of it if you're aren't already there. And just was wondering, what's driving some of that momentum. Obviously you've touched on a bunch of different valuable portions of the PEO construct, but is your sense now that win rates versus other PEOs are going up, is it more about more awareness for the PEO model or just kind of any more color you can give on what's driving sales momentum specific to maybe industry adoption? Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely, Andrew. So this is Burton. First, I believe the fall selling season is going well. So I'm excited about that. I believe we have the right approach to targeting our verticals. As we've talked about in the past, we do not run into other PEOs that often. Over 50% of the quotes that we generate and those are quotes are not competitive directly against another PEO. So I can't speak for the other PEOs. But as I said in my opening remarks, I believe this is the perfect environment for PEOs because of that remote complexity. We're investing in new sales as we build this sustainable growth. From a TriNet standpoint, I continue to be excited about the work that Jonathan LeCompte and his team are doing, and I believe we're moving toward a sustainable vision of scaled new sales. So overall, I believe we're headed in the right direction. To specifically answer another question you had, yes, I am a big believer in brand awareness and brand sentiment and PeopleForce, which we invested heavily in helped to promote that from a TriNet standpoint. But I also believe it helps raise the visibility of the PEO model for the 4-plus million businesses that have an opportunity to avail themselves to that model, whether it will be with TriNet or another one of the PEOs out there. Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst Great, thank you. And then maybe as my follow-up a different way to ask an earlier question was just around kind of the top-end of what size category would be, amenable to a PEO structure. I'm just wondering, given all the complexity around regulatory restrictions and working remote, making it all the more complicated. Is there an argument you made that companies could potentially stay within the PEO construct longer, given how much more complex it is or do you feel like that the top-end of this range is still pretty steady relative to pre-COVID? Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer It's a great question. I believe that it raises the top-end that would stay with a PEO. It really depends on the complexity. As we've talked about in the past, it's not necessarily the absolute number of workers, it's the number of states that they're in, it's the number of divisions, whether they have different operating models in different states. So all-in-all, I believe that they will stay longer based on this complexity. The average size of our clients is rising. I don't have the direct analysis. Part of it is that we're focused on the bigger clients now, but I can tell you that I am actively working on multi hundred person deals to come into TriNet today and I'm working on more of those than I have in the past. Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst Great. That's really helpful. And if it's all right if I can squeeze one more. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely. Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst For Kelly, just in terms of the insurance margin guidance, that is not incorporating any claw-back of kind of recovery credit for $25 million, correct? Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That's a great question. You are absolutely right. Given our expectation of insurance costs, we think we're well above the hurdle that would claw that back. Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Andrew. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from David Grossman from Stifel. Please go ahead. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, David. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Hey, Burton. I think this maybe came up earlier, but I just wanted to make sure I understood. When you look at the growth of the portfolio, do you have any visibility into the same store growth versus new sales, kind of give us just a sense of how that's trending this year. Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It's a good question. We don't provide that level of visibility, but I would say most of the growth during the quarter really was hiring versus net new. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Okay. And is that, do you think just unique to kind of where we are in terms of the pandemic, the recovery and all that stuff or do you see any signs in terms of your sales activity to-date that we may see that trend kind of change a little bit as you go into next year, just based on the pipeline and what [Indecipherable]? Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, it's a good question, David. Obviously, with the large installed base and the growing change in existing that has an outsized impact on the all-time high WSE count. I don't want to take anything away from new sales because I now have two quarters in a row where they're up year-over-year. So I think it's just a phenomenal customer base. And the other thing which I said in the opening remarks, which I think is kind of cool is Main Street has recovered completely from the pandemic lows. So the WSE count in those customers is back to where it was pre-pandemic. So this is a much broader recovery at this point through TriNet's lens across all of our verticals and now I can tell you that every vertical is either flat or up from the beginning starting point of 2019 before the pandemic. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Good. And just maybe just a corollary to that last comment because I had another question just about professional services. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst So it looks like professional services, kind of flattish sequentially and similar up a little bit from the first quarter. So is that kind of that mix shift back to Main Street? Is that why that number is staying relatively flat and revenue per or professional services revenue per WSE is coming down off those kind of highs that we saw in the first quarter? Is that the phenomenon going on there? Kelly Tuminelli -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well, David, I guess the way I think about it is, last quarter we had some pretty extraordinary bonus payments and a few other one-time things that I think I talked about on the call that drove the PSR on a per WSE or per average WSE base a little bit up and said, I wouldn't really expect that to continue. We still are seeing a little bit of benefit from rate as we put some minimums in on our individual clients, smaller clients, just to align with the cost to serve those smaller clients. But I think it's more of the fact that I'd highlighted some unusual last quarter that really aren't recurring quite at the same level this quarter. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Great. And then just one other question, Burton, maybe you could address this, that you talk a lot about trying to enhance the offering that will keep people longer and that makes perfect economic sense for this model. Just wondering, do you have any different thinking, on the kind of more entry level of the market where you can offer a simpler product without taking insurance risks and you can kind of take the element of scaling out of the equation or that risk, that you could incur when you take on smaller customers. Just curious if you have any thoughts at the lower end of the market? Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely, David. So we are strategizing on both of those, meaning the smaller end of the market, as well as they grow larger, to keep them longer because obviously at that point, the opportunity to help them is very important to us. So what I would say is it's all around the insurance construct and the PEO construct and from an insurance standpoint, at some point being able to support our clients other than trying at 11 [Phonetic] on non-single employer plans makes sense. I'm not announcing anything here today, but that makes sense. And on the smaller end, being able to support those clients in a model that allows them to on ramp to the TriNet PEO model also makes sense. So we're exploring all of those things, but I will not take my eyes-off of the core customer base that is supporting us in this growth [Indecipherable]. So bunch of things to come. We have some great ideas for the first half of next year and stay tuned, but I am really thrilled with the customer base we have and the opportunity we have. We are not seeing a lot of changes in the environment from a competitive standpoint and we're going to continue to execute exactly as we talked about for quite a while now. David Grossman -- Stifel Nicolaus -- Analyst Thanks very much. Burton M. Goldfield -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah.

    "content": "Six years after former BP chief executive Bob Dudley said that “the industry needs to prepare for lower for longer,” a growing number of major investment banks now expect “higher for longer” oil prices. Rebounding global oil consumption amid tight supply—contrary to some forecasts last year that indicate demand may have peaked or was close to its peak—as well as years of underinvestment in new supply following the 2015 crash, have prompted Wall Street banks to raise significantly their projections for oil prices in the short and medium term.   Oil prices have hit multi-year highs in recent days, with WTI Crude at its highest since 2014 and Brent Crude at the highest level since October 2018.  Also on rt.com Refiners suffer from record high natural gas prices Even after the latest rally, prices still have headroom to rise further, many major investment banks believe.  Goldman Sachs, for example, sees Brent hitting $90 per barrel at the end of this year, up from $80 expected earlier. The key driver of Goldman’s higher forecast is global oil demand recovery amid still a weaker supply response from non-OPEC+ oil producers.  The investment bank also sees sustained higher oil prices in the coming years.   Fundamentals warrant higher oil prices, and the bank’s forecast for the next several years is $85 a barrel, Damien Courvalin, Head of Energy Research & Senior Commodity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC earlier this month. Oil demand will set record highs next year and the year after that, and we need to see a ramp-up in investment, he said.  “We’re facing potential multi-year deficits and the risk of significantly higher prices,” Courvalin told CNBC.  RBC Capital Markets is also bullish on oil prices in the medium term.  “We maintain the view that we have held all year - that the oil market remains in the early days of a multi-year, structurally strong cycle,” RBC analyst Michael Tran said in a note in mid-October carried by Reuters. Also on rt.com The 2021 oil price rally is far from over Last week, Morgan Stanley raised its long-term oil price outlook up by $10 per barrel to $70. BNP Paribas expects oil prices at nearly $80 a barrel in 2023, Bloomberg notes.  UBS expects oil prices “to remain well supported into next year,” with the market staying tight at least until the first quarter of 2022, due to the lowest inventories in OECD since 2015, only gradual easing of the OPEC+ cuts, and oil demand hitting 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in December 2021.  “While demand is expected to increase as well next year, additional OPEC+ and US production should result in a balanced oil market. With more OPEC+ members struggling to increase production in line with the group’s plans, its additions in 2022 will likely be only a fraction of the currently intended 3.76mbpd increase, which should prevent an oversupplied market, in our view,” Giovanni Staunovo, Dominic Schnider, and Wayne Gordon wrote on Friday.  “So bearing all of this in mind, we now expect Brent to trade at $90/bbl in December and March, before leveling off to $85/bbl for the rest of 2022,” UBS’s analysts added.  Beyond 2022, oil prices are likely to remain structurally higher as oil demand will continue to rise while new supply would lag consumption growth, primarily due to five years of underinvestment and the pressure on oil majors to cut emissions and investments in new supply, analysts say.  Global annual upstream spending needs to increase by as much as 54% to $542 billion if the oil market is to avert the next supply shortage shock, Moody’s said earlier this month. Also on rt.com Oil hits multi-year highs on tight global supply “Our analysis demonstrates that upstream companies will need to increase their spending considerably for the medium term to fully replace reserves and avoid declines in future production,” Moody’s Vice President Sajjad Alam said.   The oil industry is “massively underinvesting” in supply to meet growing demand, which is set to return to pre-COVID levels as soon as the end of 2021 or early 2022, Greg Hill, president of US oil producer Hess Corp, said at the end of September. Last year, global upstream investment sank to a 15-year low of $350 billion, according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie from earlier this year.  This article was originally published on Oilprice.com",

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - Here, we have a digitally rendered model of the recently-launched Mahindra XUV700, which has been reimagined as a police car Mahindra & Mahindra launched the XUV700 in India a little while back. The SUV not only looks handsome, but it also has a lot of features on offer along with powerful engine options. The XUV700 has managed to create a lot of buzz in the market, and in just two days after launch, it had garnered over 50,000 orders, following which the manufacturer has temporarily stopped bookings. Mahindra SUVs and MUVs, like Scorpio and Bolero, are used as cop cars by many state police departments. It wouldn’t be a stretch to imagine the new XUV700 filling the same shoes. Automotive lifestyle store XLR8 has created a digitally rendered image, which shows us what the XUV700 would look like as a police car. The vehicle sports white exterior paint with red and blue livery, which makes it easy to recognise this as a police car. In case that was too subtle, there are ‘Police’ decals on the sides, and one on the top of the windshield. Of course, blue and red flashing lights have been added to the roof. Mahindra XUV700 is available with two engine options – a 2.0L turbo-petrol unit and a 2.2L turbo-diesel unit. The former is good for a peak power of 200 PS and a maximum torque of 380 Nm. The diesel motor, on the other hand, is available in two states of tune. On the MX trim, it generates 155 PS and 360 Nm, while on the AX trims, it belts out 185 PS and 450 Nm (420 Nm on MT variants). Transmission options include a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed torque-converter automatic. For the police, the XUV700 could be outfitted with plenty of additional features and tech, like radio communication equipment, weapon holsters, etc. Also, the SUV has a lot of space on offer and can be had in 5-seat and 7-seat configurations. If employed by any police department, we’re sure that the XUV700 would do great. However, with the waiting period already hovering around six to seven months, we’re not sure if M&M could fulfill any such orders at the moment. Also, the semiconductor shortage is a major problem, not just for Mahindra, but other automakers as well, forcing manufacturers to limit vehicle production.

My name is Karen. I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2021 Industrias Bachoco Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you for your attention. I will now turn the call over to Andrea Guerrero. Andrea, you may begin. Andrea Guerrero -- Investor Relations Thank you, Karen. Good afternoon and welcome to Bachoco's third quarter 2021 conference call. We released our financials today before the market opened. If you need a copy of the release, please visit our website or request it from our Investor Relations department. This afternoon's call contains certain information that could be considered forward-looking statements regarding anticipated future events and performance. These statements reflect management's current beliefs based on information currently available and are not guarantees of future performance and are based on our estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in our Annual Report or 20-F, which could make our current results differ materially from the forward-looking statements discussed in this call. Except as required by applicable law, Industrias Bachoco undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Lastly, unless otherwise indicated, the amounts mentioned in this conference will be figures of 2020 with comparative figures for the same period of 2020 in Mexican pesos. As a reference, the exchange rate as of September 30, 2021 was MXN20.64 per US dollar. Here with me are our CEO, Mr. Rodolfo Ramos and our CFO, Mr. Daniel Salazar. Now, I will give the call to Mr. Ramos. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Andrea and good morning, everyone. As we mentioned in our press release issued today, we faced challenging conditions during the quarter, but still we're able to deliver positive results. In Mexico, we observed a typical softness in demand for this time of the year, which result in a reduction of around 4% in poultry prices when compared to the first half of 2021. However, also for this segment, we achieved an increase of 9% versus the third quarter of 2020. In the US, main commodity prices such as [Indecipherable] remained strong versus 2020 for both the quarter and the year-to-date. Particularly for this third quarter, we continue to have pressure on the cost side. Grain and soybean meal prices in US dollar remained high, even factoring in the positive impact of the 9% appreciation of the Mexican peso. We observed grain around 50% higher than the third quarter of 2020 while soybean meal was in the range of 20% above the same period in peso terms. This caused an important impact in our cost of sales and in our net margins. In our other segments, volume sold was down, close to 5%, mainly driven by our balance feed and pork businesses. Balance feed market have experienced some pressures that have resulted in high raw material cost. On the other hand, the downside in pork is a result of adjustment made as part of our integration process in SASA. The aforementioned condition led us to an EBITDA margin for the quarter of 5.6% versus 10% achieved in the same period of 2020. Regarding year-to-date results, our total sales increased 19.8% when compared to the same period of 2020 with an EBITDA margin of 10.7% versus 6.4% margin in the first nine months of 2020. Despite the challenges, we continue with a very solid financial structure, attending to our customers and selling all of our production volumes. Therefore, our plans continue toward growth and efficiencies. The strategies then allow us to be better prepared to face the challenges of the industry in which we compete while delivering positive results. At this point, I will turn the call over to Daniel for a discussion of the financial results. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rodolfo and good morning, everyone. As a result of the conditions Rodolfo mentioned, our company third quarter '21 net sales increased 10.6% in the quarter when compared with the third quarter of 2020. The increase is a result of higher prices in our business lines for the nine months of the year. Sales were 19.8% higher than the same period of 2020. In the quarter, sales of our US operation represented 26% of total sales compared with a 28.3% reported in the equivalent quarter of 2020. This was the result of an increase in the participation of our Mexican operation. Cost of sales for the third quarter was MXN17,619 million and MXN49,659.7 million for the nine months of the year. This represents an increase of 16.6% of the quarter and 14.8% for the year. This increase was due at the higher cost of our raw materials, both in dollar and Mexican peso terms. Gross profit for the quarter was MXN2,610 million with a gross margin of 12.9% compared with the 17.4% gross margin for the third quarter 2020. For the nine months of the year, we reached a gross profit of MXN10,787.9 million with a margin of 17.8%. This amount is 29.3% higher than the gross profit reached in the same period of 2020. Total SG&A for the third quarter of 2020 was MXN1,790.9 million and MXN5,157.4 million year-to-date, representing an 8.9% and 8.8% respectively when compared to sales. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported an operating income of MXN738.4 million with a margin of 3.7%. The operation income for the nine months of 2020 was MXN5,386.1 [Phonetic] million with operating margin of 8.9% higher when compared to the 4.3% reached in the same period of 2020. EBITDA margin for third quarter was 5.6% that is lower than the 10% EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2020. For the accumulated nine months for the year, the EBITDA margin was 10.7% higher when compared with the 6.4% reached in the same period of 2020. In the third quarter of 2021, we reported a net financial income of MXN459.6 million and MXN682.2 million for the nine months of 2021 compared with the net financial loss of MXN267.5 million and the net financial income of MXN2,036.8 million for third quarter and nine months of 2020 respectively. Our total taxes were MXN380.6 million for the quarter. For the first nine months of 2021, our total tax were MXN1,733.3 million. All the above led us to a net income of MXN817.4 million for the quarter with a net margin of 4%. For the accumulated nine months of 2021, the net income totaled MXN4,335.1 million with a net margin of 7.2%. Going into our balance sheet, we maintain a healthy financial structure with an increase in total assets of 8.2% when compared to the year-end of 2020. Our net cash was MXN18,269.7 at the end of the quarter, 10.5% higher than our net cash level at the beginning of the year. Lastly, capex was MXN2,251.1 million, which is 43.4% higher when compared to the same period of 2020. Well, thank you and I will turn the call back to Rodolfo for final comment. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Daniel. Now we are entering into the fourth quarter, in line with the seasonality. Pricing in Mexico for the beginning of the quarter remains weak. Normally demand starts to pick-up toward the end of the year. Pricing of corn remains high year-over-year, but soybean meal is now very close to the level of 2020. In the US, even though breast meat [Indecipherable] starting to come down, it is still higher than previous years. However, grain cost and labor will be challenges to overcome until the year-end. We expect to continue with our capex above maintenance levels as part of our organic growth strategy. Even when we observe uncertain conditions ahead, we continue to focus on our growth plans. We have a very solid financial structure to support our project and which will allow us to face challenges than the future can present. With that, we will now take your questions. Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Fernando Olvera from BoA. Fernando Olvera -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. I have two [Indecipherable]. The first one is related to the pork [Phonetic] business in Mexico. Can you give us an update of how is the balance between supply and demand so far in October? And can you share, what is your view about pricing in this quarter and in 2022. That's the first one and I have one more related to the US. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Well, the balance of supply and demand for the rest of the year is going to be tight in terms of supply. Normally, in the beginning of the fourth quarter, the demand is very weak. That's a normal situation because people spend more money in other issues like the beginning of the school, they came from vacations and they are a little bit running out in terms of money. And in the other hand, the supply is good because the weather has started to change and then the daily gain started to improve. So we got a little bit more supply and weak demand all the years, normally this part of the year is the weakest of the year. But at the end of the year, we are expecting a good demand. The demand is going to be there and we are expecting a better balance between supply and demand and that is going to -- we are expecting that that situation is going to remain for the first quarter of 2022. Fernando Olvera -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Thank you. And regarding pricing, you have [Technical Issues] on pricing. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer It's very difficult to predict the price, but when you have a good supply and demand and we are expecting for the last part of this quarter, the fourth quarter, we expect to maintain our margin, our regular margins for that time of the year, because right now we have the problem with the cost and we are expecting a better cost for the last part of the year because soybean meal and corn prices had been going -- went down a little bit and so we are going to collect that cost at the end of the year. So we expect to have a normalized margins for the rest of the year and the beginning of the first quarter. Fernando Olvera -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. And my second question is related to the US. I don't know if you could quantify how much of the pressure on margins came precisely from labor shortages and distribution constraints in the US. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Well, as you mentioned, labor is -- after the cost of the raw materials, labor is a very, very important issue in the States. And as discussing -- I cannot tell you at this moment, what is the percentage of the margin that is taking that increase in labor, but we have to be competitive and we have to be competitive in terms of salaries. So we had an increase in cost because of that and we experienced some shortages of labor a couple of months ago or something like that. Right now, we are in our way to fully staff our plants and we expect to be totally fully staffed at the end of the year. Fernando Olvera -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Perfect. Helpful. Thank you. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Fernando and good afternoon. Operator And we do have our next question from Emiliano Hernandez from GBM. Emiliano Hernandez -- GBM -- Analyst Hello Rodolfo, Daniel, thanks for the stage for questions. I hope you're doing well. Just a quick one on my side regarding the filing that you made to issue up to MXN10 billion in that certificate. Can you share the strategy there and what would the users of that proceed would be taken into account that you have already around MXN18 billion in net cash? Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Emiliano. Well, the rational behind this strategy is to have an open financial avenue for Mexican peso in the Mexican market, because before that, we didn't have authorized program for getting that market. So actually we don't have a specific proceed for this capability. We saw the program only to have the capability to do so. The idea is to have this possible financial capability for future acquisition, for future world strategy. Actually, we don't have a precise proceed for this capability. Emiliano Hernandez -- GBM -- Analyst That's very clear, Daniel. Thank you very much. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer You're welcome. Operator And we do have our next question from Alan Alanis from Santander. Alan Alanis -- Banco Santander SA -- Analyst Sure. Thank you so much. Hey, Daniel. Hey, Rodolfo. Congratulations on the results. The first question is more about the elasticity of pricing in Mexico. Are you seeing any difference? It seems that you are being able to take pricing in the mid-teens and volumes are holding up. Any comment that you can make in terms of the changes or if it remains the same, the elasticity of the Mexican consumer in the consumption of poultry? Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Well, thank you, Alan. Well, the prices of the chicken is better than the last year. The problem is the cost, because of the raw material, but right now the prices are good in terms of the equivalent of the last year. So we expect that the prices are going to hold that level, and even we expect better prices at the end of the year. So in that, we are seeing, as I mentioned before, the margins are comparably more or less in line with the seasonality of the last part of the year. Right now, the levels of the pricing is very weak, as I mentioned before, but we are expecting that -- rebound in those prices. Remember that more than 50% of the Mexican market is kind of a commodity. Live market accounts for one-third of the market and traditional market is with live and the traditional markets account for more than 50% of the total market. So the volatility is there, and right now we are seeing a recovery in prices, in line with the seasonality, and right now we are just in front of the date, which is November 2nd, and normally that date is a very good date for chicken consumption. Alan Alanis -- Banco Santander SA -- Analyst Got it. Got it. Yeah, I mean, it should be very resilient versus other propanes and as you said, a lot of it is the commodity. Let me ask you a different question and start by saying that the objective of the question is just to understand, I'm not suggesting that you do one thing or another, I just want to understand, you have almost MXN1 billion of cash right now, and then you have this approval for issuing bonds for another MXN10 billion, which is another $500 million. So your ammunition or your weapons are -- you can deploy $1.5 billion without any big problem. Now whatever you acquire, whatever you deploy on that, my sense and correct me if I'm wrong, is that it will be at a multiple that is higher than the 3.5 times EBITDA that you are currently trading. In other words, whatever you acquire will have to be a six or seven, or maybe depending if its processed food, more higher than that. And I guess the question here is, why -- you can use two thirds of your available cash and buy your own shares. What's the rationale behind not doing that, behind saying, yes, I know that my stock is trading at 3.5 times EBITDA, but I still think that it'll be better in the long run for all the shareholders, particularly the controlling shareholders to continue doing acquisitions at a multiple that might be, well, in some instances below [Indecipherable], then it'll maybe twice as much as your multiple is trading. And again, my objective is to try to understand what the thinking of the board and the control group. I don't know if it's a fair question or not. Hopefully it is. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, thank you, Alan. Of course, this is a possibility, and this is something that we have discussed with the board. But our priorities to deploy this bunch of money in continued evolving and the speed of our inorganic growth in the future. We do what you are suggesting, somehow could slow down our speed in the future growth. Anyway, it's a valid question and an option that we are evaluating among other options. But the rationale for not doing that in this moment, is because our priority is to deploy the money for our organic and inorganic growth strategy. Alan Alanis -- Banco Santander SA -- Analyst Got it. And in the inorganic growth, your preference is right now for pork over poultry, and maybe pork in -- yeah, that's fair, correct? Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Well, not necessarily. In Mexico, we're looking for a different kind of proteins, different kind of business lines and the poultry is more outside Mexico. Alan Alanis -- Banco Santander SA -- Analyst Got it. Thank you so much again and congrats and again, I was just -- I'm just trying to understand the rationale. Thank you so much for taking my question. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Alan. Operator And we do have our next question from Ulises Argote from J.P. Morgan. Ulises Argote -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Hello Rodolfo, Daniel. Thanks for the questions. Just one quick follow-up here on the cost side of the equation, I think the rest of my questions have already been answered. But can you comment a little bit on how the costs are shaping up now toward the fourth quarter, and in particular, and maybe into the first part of 2022, kind of factoring in your three month rolling hedge. Did we get the peak here in the third quarter in terms of cost pressure, or do you still kind of expect to see that lingering for a couple of quarters more? Thanks. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Well, right now the cost of corn and soybeans are more or less stable. Corn is holding at around 5.3, which is still higher than the last year, but I think has been stable for a couple months and I think it's going to remain for the rest of the year. And in terms of the freight and things like that, we already closed some of our vessel freight up to -- at least for the first quarter of 2022. So our basis in terms of freights are already booked at very decent levels. Basis, we have the whole year with basis, and right now we are looking for the basis for the first order of 2022 and those markets are very firm and for that reason, we are looking for those -- to book that kind of product. Gas and other issues that impact the cost, we don't have any hedge about gas or even soybean oil and we are just following those markets in order to see an opportunity to book those ingredients or materials to hedge our consumptions in that regard. Labor is an issue. Labor by far is 23% higher than the last year and here in Mexico, we are expecting an increase according to the regular inflation, which is around 6%, 7%. I think the minimum wage is going to increase that level. And in the States, I think it's going to remain high. They are already high, and I think it's going to remain with that trend. Important thing about labor in the States is availability, because we need to cover and to fully staff our plants, and we are struggling in order to achieve that -- in that matter. So that's the situation -- that's what we are expecting in terms of the cost. Right now, as we see [Phonetic] oil is close to $90, $85 per barrel, so it's very, very high. So that's going to impact that. Ulises Argote -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Yeah, that's super helpful, Rodolfo. Thanks for that. So, basically from your comments, I get that we shouldn't really expect any less pressure in the cost side of the equation, let's say for the fourth quarter, right? That kind of sequentially should be very similar to what we saw right now in the third quarter. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Ulises Argote -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, guys. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ulises. Operator And we do have our next question from Jay Hill from Tweedy, Browne. Jay Hill -- Tweedy, Browne -- Analyst Hi Rodolfo. Hi Daniel. Good afternoon. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Hi Jay. Jay Hill -- Tweedy, Browne -- Analyst Hi guys. Hey look, thank you very much for taking my question. I'm going to sort of piggyback on the question that Alan asked earlier, but look, over the last decade, it's very clear to me that Bachoco has been managed extremely well, and you guys have created a lot of shareholder value. But this value is not currently being recognized in the stock market. And just to give you a sense of the value creation, I think given sort of the cyclical nature of your business, I believe the best long-term measure of value creation is your growth in tangible book value per share, plus cumulative dividends paid per share over time. And since 2010, on this measure, you've grown tangible book value per share, plus cumulative dividends per share at a compound annual rate above 11%. Over that same period, you guys have generated an average return-on-equity of a little over 11%, which is really a great result despite the fact that you guys have an inefficient capital structure with large net cash that you've held throughout this period. So look, the stock market is clearly not recognizing the strong, long term financial track record that your company has generated. To me, Bachoco is ridiculously cheap on any normalized earnings valuation measure. The guide earlier talked about 3.5 times EBITDA, but on any sort of long term measure of normalized earnings, your stock is extremely cheap, it's frustrating to be a shareholder. I suspect your board is also frustrated and also recognizes the very cheap valuation. So my question to both of you is, look, you've got this large net cash position, currently represents over 40% of the market cap, and you've got this very low stock market valuation. Why doesn't the board adopt a shareholder repurchase plan? That's one. And then two, I know you guys want to do M&A, that's great. I think there's enough money to do both. And then I have a follow up. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, of course you are right. You have made a good analysis and we have issues that we deal, before. And as I mentioned to Alan before, this is an option that we are [Indecipherable] among others. So it's a possibility, given the current value that the company is performing. But as I mentioned before, our priorities to deploy the money that we have for our strategy. Of course, we need to increase the speed of our M&A activity. But you're right. There is no -- an obstacle, we perform both options. In any case, this is something that we are evaluating right now. We don't have any decisions in that regard. Jay Hill -- Tweedy, Browne -- Analyst Well, I appreciate that response, Daniel and I hope the board will seriously consider repurchasing shares. Again, I think you could repurchase shares and do buybacks. And then I would also -- just to piggyback on what Alan said earlier, look, there's always a trade-off between, how should you -- what's the best use of spending the shareholders money? Is it on M&A, or is it on share purchase, and I would find it hard to imagine that you could find an M&A candidate that's more attractive than buying your own shares in the open stock market? So please, please consider that. I think it makes a ton of sense for all of your remaining shareholders. Thank you, Daniel and Rodolfo. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Jay. Of course, be sure that whatever we decide, we will take into consideration the best interest of our investment community. Operator [Operator instructions] And we do have our next question from Juan Ponce from Bradesco. Juan Ponce -- Bradesco -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon, Rodolfo, Daniel. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the electricity bill currently in the lower house, I would like to hear your thoughts on the potential impact on your business. What percent of the cost is electricity and how much of the energy is sourced from private producers? Thanks. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Well, the utilities or energy bill accounts for no more than 3% of our total cost. That includes gas, natural gas, propane plus electricity. Electricity per se is 2.5% of our total cost. So the impact is going to be very, very low. In the other hand, right now we have our own generation, that allows to have at least 20% lower cost than the regular cost of the CFE. So the impact is going to be not material. Juan Ponce -- Bradesco -- Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Juan. Saludos. Operator And we have our next question from Fernando Olvera from BOA. Fernando Olvera -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi thanks for the follow up. Just a quick one. Can you explain the higher capex this quarter please, and if you have any update about the acquisition of RYC Alimentos? Thank you. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer So in terms of the capex, the increase is because, we are increasing the speed of our pipeline of capital expenditure, not for additional capital expenditure that we want to perform. And regarding the RYC Alimentos, we are still waiting for the antitrust authorities authorization. But we already know it that the -- the concern that they have is regarding the anti -- the non-compete provision that we include in the SPA. So we don't know if the authorities will ask us to change that provision or not, but we are in that point of the review. Probably in the next month, we will have a resolution and we will let you know, as soon as we know. Fernando Olvera -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Thank you, Daniel. Daniel Salazar Ferrer -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Fernando. Operator And I am showing that there are no more questions at this time. Rodolfo Ramos -- Chief Executive Officer Okay. Thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. If you have any further questions, please contact our Investor Relation area, who will be glad to assist you with your questions. Thank you very much.

Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good afternoon. My name is France, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook third-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook vice president of Investor Relations, you may begin. Deborah Crawford -- Vice President of Investor Relations Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's third-quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of GAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer [audio gap] everyone, and thanks for joining today. We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities and our community continues to grow. There are now almost 3.6 billion people who actively use one or more of our services and I'm excited about our roadmap to keep building great new experiences for them. As expected, we did experience revenue headwinds this quarter, including from Apple's changes that are not only negatively affecting our business but millions of small businesses in what is already a difficult time for them and the economy. Sheryl and Dave will talk about this more later, but the bottom line is we expect we'll be able to navigate these headwinds over time with investments that we're already making today. Before we get to our product update, I want to discuss the recent debate around our company. I believe large organizations should be [inaudible], so I'd much rather live in a society where they are than one where they can't be. Good criticism helps us get better, but my view is that what we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company. The reality is that we have an open culture where we encourage discussion and research about our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us. We have an industry-leading program to study the effects of our products and provide transparency to our progress because we care about getting this right. When we make decisions, we need to balance competing social equities. Like free expression with reducing harmful content or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement or enabling research and interoperability with blocking down data as much as possible. It makes a good soundbite to say that we don't solve these impossible trade-offs because we're just focused on making money. But the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business but about balancing different difficult social values. And I repeatedly called for regulations to provide clarity because I don't think companies should be making so many of these decisions ourselves. I am proud of our record navigating the complex trade-offs involved in offering services at a global scale, and I'm proud of the research and transparency we bring to our work. Our programs are industry-leading. We have made massive investments in safety and security with more than 40,000 people and we are on track to spend more than $5 billion on safety and security in 2021. I believe that's more than any other tech company, even adjusted for scale. We set the standard for transparency with our quarterly enforcement reports and tools like Ad Archive. We established a new model for independent academic researchers to safely access data. We pioneered the oversight board as a model of self-regulation. And as a result, we believe that our systems are the most effective at reducing harmful content across the industry, and I think that any honest accounts of how we handle these issues should include that. I also think that any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media. That means that no matter what Facebook does, we're never going to solve them on our own. For example, polarization started rising in the US before I was born. At the same, independent research shows that many countries around the world have flat or declining polarization despite similar social media use there than in the US. We've seen this pattern repeat with other issues as well. The reality is if social media is not the main driver of these issues, then probably can't fix them by itself either. We should want every other company in our industry to make the investment and achieve the results that we have. I worry about the incentives that we are creating for other companies to be as introspective as we have been. But I am committed to continuing this work because I believe it will be better for our community and our business over the long term. Now, we can't change the underlying media dynamics. But there is a different constituency that we serve that has always been more important and then I try to keep us focused and that's people. Billions of people use our services because we build the best tools to stay connected to the people you care about, to find communities that matter to you, and to grow your small business. And the reason we've been able to succeed for almost two decades is because we keep evolving and building. Facebook started in the dorm room and grew into a global website. We invented the News Feed and a new kind of ads platform. We became a mobile-first experience and then we grew a whole family of apps that serve billions of people. And there is so much more to build. Even with all of the tools that we have today, we still can feel like we're right there together with the people we care about when we're physically apart. We can teleport as holograms to instantly be at the office without a commute or in a concert with a friend or in your parent's living room to catch up. The creative economy and commerce tools are still nascent and there should be opportunity for millions of more people to make a living doing the work that they love. Our three product priorities remain our focus on creators, commerce, and building the next computing platform. A big part of our work with creators is our focus on Reels. Reels is already the primary driver of engagement profiles. It's incredibly entertaining and I think that there is a huge amount of potential ahead. We expect this to continue growing and I am optimistic that Reels will be as important for our products as Stories is. We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience. One aspect of this is given all our apps, the goal of being the best services for young adults, which we defined as ages 18 to 29. Historically, young adults have been a strong base and that's important because they are the future. But over the last decade, as the audience that uses our apps has expanded so much and we focused on serving everyone, our services have gotten dialed to be the best for most people who use them, rather than, specifically, for young adults. And during this period, competition has also gotten a lot more intense, especially with Apple's iMessage growing in popularity, and more recently, the rise of TikTok, which is one of the most effective competitors that we have ever faced. Though we are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star, rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people. Like everything, this will involve trade-offs in our products and it will likely mean that the rest of our community will grow more slowly than it otherwise would have. But it should also mean that our services become stronger for young adults, this shift will take years not months to fully execute, and I think it's the right approach to building our community and company for the long term. Our next product priority is commerce, helping people discover new products that they're interested in, and reach customers inside our apps. We're going to unlock a lot of opportunities. As Apple changes, makes e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web, solutions that allow big businesses to set up shop right inside our apps will become increasingly attractive and important to them. We build solutions like ads that can dynamically point to either a business's website or their shop on our platforms depending on what will perform better for them. And that will help more businesses navigate this challenging dynamic in the environment. Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multi-year journey. Marketplace is already at scale and lots of people rely on it, especially now it's supply chain issues that make it harder to get new products, Shops are getting more developed, and we have an exciting program planned for this holiday season where we're working closely with a number of the businesses that have invested the most in Shops to identify what works to find new customers and grow their businesses even faster. Our plan is to then scale those solutions more broadly in 2022. Beyond Reels and commerce, I also want to share some thoughts on our longer-term efforts to build the next computing platform and help bring the metaverse to life. This is a major area of investment for us and an important part of our strategy going forward. And I view this work as critical to our mission because delivering extensive products like you're right there with another person, that's the holy grail of online social experience. Over the next decade, these new platforms are going to start to unlock the kinds of experiences that I've wanted to build since before I even started Facebook. Along with those social experiences, I expect a massive increase in the creator economy and amount of digital goods and commerce. If you're in the metaverse every day, then you'll need digital clothes and digital tools and different experiences. Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a billion people and hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce aesthetic. And strategically, helping to shape the next platform should also reduce our dependence on delivering our services to our competitors. Building the foundational platform for the metaverse will be a long road. We just released the 128-gigabyte Quest 2, replacing the 64-gigabyte model for $299. With EssilorLuxottica, we've released our first smart glasses and they're off to a strong start as well. But bringing this vision to life isn't just about building one glasses product. There is a whole ecosystem. We're building multiple generations of our VR and AR products at the same time, as well as the new operating system and development model, the digital commerce platform, content studios, and of course, the social platform. So, to reflect the significance of this for our business, today, we are announcing a change to our financial reporting. Starting next quarter, we will begin disclosing financial metrics for Facebook Reality Lab separately from our family of apps. And this will provide investors with additional visibility into the investments that we're making in augmented and virtual reality. In 2021, we expect these investments to reduce our overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and I expect this investment to grow even further for each of the next several years. Dave will share more about this later, but I encourage you all to tune into Connect on Thursday to hear more about our vision and our work here in more detail. I recognize the magnitude of this bet on the future and I am grateful for the support from our investors, the creative community, and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our company to bring this inspiring future to life. And with that, here's Sheryl. Sheryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. This quarter, our total revenue was $29 billion, up 35 percent year over year. We saw solid revenue growth across all regions and we continued to grow our user base. We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want to explain some of the revenue softness we've seen and what we're doing to mitigate the headwinds and help businesses over the crucial holiday period and beyond. To start, let's take a step back. Over the past decade, we've seen more and more businesses shift online. When the pandemic hit, its digital transformation accelerated. We've invested in tools and products over many years to help businesses make this shift, so this acceleration drove very strong growth for us throughout the last few quarters. We've been open about the fact that there were headwinds coming and we've experienced that in Q3. The biggest is the impact of Apple iOS 14 changes, which has created headwinds for others in the industry as well, major challenges for small businesses, and advantaged Apple's own advertising business. We started to see that impact in Q2 but adoption on the consumer side ramped up by late June, so it hit critical mass in Q3. As a result, we've encountered two challenges. One is that the accuracy of our ads targeting decreased, which increased the cost of driving outcomes for our advertisers. And the other is that measuring those outcomes became more difficult. On targeting, we focused on improving campaign performance even with the increased limitations facing our industry. We're building commerce tools to help businesses reach more new customers and get more incremental sales. And over the longer term, we're developing privacy-enhancing technologies in collaboration with others across the industry to help minimize the amount of personal information we process, while still allowing us to share relevant ads. Progress in these areas will take time and will be a focus for us throughout 2022 and beyond. On measurement, as we wrote in a recent blog post, we believe we are underreporting iOS web conversions. This means real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher than what's being reported for many advertisers, especially small advertisers. We're making good progress fixing them. We think we'll be able to address more than half of the underreporting by the end of this year and we'll continue to work on this into 2022. Another external factor is slowing e-commerce growth. The strong e-commerce growth in recent quarters was driven in part by the acceleration of the digital transformation that has now tapered out. I think most people see this in their own lives. There was a period of time when many people who were able to stay at home and ordered things online much more. But now, in many places, things have opened up and people are increasingly making purchases in person. That doesn't mean e-commerce has stopped growing. Businesses are still making the shift online, but e-commerce is no longer growing at the pace it was at the height of the pandemic. These factors have been compounded for many advertisers by major global supply chain issues and labor shortages, which have left many consumer businesses with less inventory. This has reduced their appetite to generate demand from consumers, which has impacted advertising spends. Businesses in every region and across a range of verticals have been affected. At the same time, we've also seen some impact from COVID surges around the world in places like Southeast Asia. Overall, if it wasn't for Apple's iOS 14 changes, we would have seen positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. And while we and our advertisers will continue to feel the effect of these changes in future quarters, we will continue working hard to mitigate them. Despite the headwinds, we remain confident about our future. We believe Facebook and Instagram are the best place for people to connect with their friends and families, build communities, and start and grow businesses. And we believe they're still the best platform for advertisers to reach people where they are and get measurable outcomes. Our focus remains where it has always been: building products that help people connect and businesses grow. Mark talked about video a moment ago. Not only is this a growing area for us overall, but we're also continuing to get better monetizing it. More than 60 percent of video revenue now comes from mobile-first video, meaning videos that are shot vertically or under 15 seconds. Over 2 billion people per month now watch videos that are eligible for industry MAV, which are ads shown before, during, or after videos. And we're expanding access to Reel's ads on Instagram to more advertisers with automatic placement in new creative formats. Another area we're seeing good progress is in lead generation. Our products helped businesses generate quality leads of scale and meet customers where they are on their preferred channel of communication, whether it's messaging, forms, or calls. In April, we started rolling out a new conversion leads optimization goal for higher-quality leads and advertisers can also integrate their CRM with Facebook via our Conversions API. Our tests show that on average, advertisers see a 20 percent increase in lead-to-sale conversion rate when they use both the optimization goal and the integration. Q4 is the most important quarter of the year for many businesses large and small. As always, we're focused on making the holiday season a success for them. We're working to fix the measurement issues they're experiencing and deliver the tools and products they need to grow. And we're rolling out a range of holiday shopping experiences to help people find great deals, support small businesses in good causes, and shop with local and Black-owned businesses. We're bringing exclusive gifts to Shops that will be available when people check out on Facebook or Instagram like 20 percent off your first purchase and free shop -- shipping. Starting next week, we'll host daily live shopping experiences of companies large and small. Brands like Walmart, Macy's, Benefit Cosmetics, and Paintbox Nails to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals. And we're bringing back one of my favorite campaigns ever, #BuyBlack Friday to showcase Black-owned small businesses during the holidays. It includes things like #BuyBlack collections in the Facebook and Instagram shop tabs and a weekly #BuyBlack Friday show with live shopping segments from up-and-coming Black-owned small businesses. I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world and to our incredible teams who are working so hard to help people and businesses throughout this period. Now, here's Dave. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results in the third quarter in the face of a challenging mobile platform landscape and an evolving macroeconomic environment. Let's begin with our community metrics. Our global community continued to grow even as we lap elevated user growth in the third quarter of last year related to the pandemic. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily business -- basis in September, and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users reached 1.93 billion, up six percent or 110 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66 percent or 2.91 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by 170 million or six percent compared to last year. Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $29 billion, up 35 percent or 34 percent on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind, and had foreign currency -- foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 of last year, total revenue would have been $259 million lower. Q3 ad revenue was $28.3 billion, up 33 percent or 32 percent on a constant currency basis. On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 50 percent. Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific grew 35 percent, 31 percent, and 28 percent, respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of World benefited from currency tailwinds, though to a lesser degree than in the prior quarter. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased nine percent, the average price per ad increased 22 percent. Compression growth was driven primarily by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from advertiser demand and lapping COVID-related pricing weakness during the third quarter of last year. Though as Sheryl noted, growth was hindered by three primary headwinds. First, advertising spend was negatively impacted by performance and measurement headwinds related to Apple's ATT changes. Second, we are seeing some macro headwinds as growth in online commerce has moderated from the elevated levels experienced earlier in the pandemic and businesses faced supply chain disruptions. Third, COVID resurgences in Southeast Asia have led to additional lockdowns and a curtailment of economic activity. Other revenue was $734 million, up 195 percent, driven by strong Quest 2 sales. Turning now to expenses. Q3 total expenses were $18.6 billion, up 38 percent compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 38 percent, driven mostly by consumer hardware costs, core infrastructure investments, and payments to partners. R and D increased 33 percent, driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 32 percent, mainly driven by marketing spend and hiring. Lastly, G and A expenses increased 65 percent, driven primarily by higher legal-related costs and employee-related costs. We added over 4,700 net new hires in Q3, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 68,100 full-time employees, up 28 percent -- up 20 percent compared to last year. Third-quarter operating income was $10.4 billion, representing a 36 percent operating margin. Our tax rate was 13 percent. Net income was $9.2 billion or $3.22 per share. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $4.5 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. Free cash flow is $9.5 billion and we ended the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased $14.4 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and had $8 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of September 30th. Today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. Turning now to the outlook. Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to break out Facebook Reality Labs or FRL as a separate reporting segment. As we've discussed, we are dedicating significant resources toward our augmented and virtual reality products and services, which are an important part of our work to develop the next generation of online social experiences. The new segment disclosures will provide additional information on the performance of FRL and the investments we are making. Under this reporting structure, we'll provide revenue and operating profit for two segments. The first segment, family of apps, will include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. The second segment, Facebook Reality Labs, will include augmented and virtual reality-related hardware, software, and content. As Mark noted, we expect our investment in FRL to reduce our overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years. Ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings call, we will share additional details about the reported -- reporting format of our segments' financials. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect fourth-quarter 2021 total revenue to be in the range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Our outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we face in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes and macroeconomic- and COVID-related factors. In addition, we expect non-ads revenue to be down year over year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch of Quest 2 during last year's holiday shopping season. As previously noted, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $71 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $70 billion to $73 billion. We anticipate our full-year 2022 total expenses will be in the range of $91 billion to $97 billion, driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $19 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $19 billion to $21 billion. For 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $29 billion to $34 billion, driven by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. A large factor driving the increase in capex spend is an investment in our AI and machine learning capabilities, which we expect to benefit our efforts in ranking and recommendations for experiences across our products, including in feed and video, as well as improving ads performance and relevance. We expect our Q4 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. Absent any changes to US tax law, we would expect our full-year tax rate in 2022 to be similar to the full-year 2021 rate. Please note that our outlook for 2022 expenses, capital expenditures, and tax rate are preliminary estimates as we have not yet finalized our 2022 budget. In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business despite facing some headwinds. And we believe the investments we're making in our current services, as well as new products and experiences, will enable us to remain the best place for people to connect and for businesses to advertise, both now and in the years ahead With that, France, let's open up the call for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead. Brian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on Reels. It sounds you get to pretty important part of long-term adoption. Curious to hear about anything you'll share about current user adoption, current engagement, or more color on the demographics of people who are using Reels now. And then the second one, just a little more question on Apple and the ATT changes. Appreciate the color on accuracy and measurement improvements. Any more specifics you can share about where you've made the most progress from your investment to date and sort of some of the areas we're seeing more challenges you need to continue to invest to really improve to navigate through this more challenging environment? Thanks. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Brian. On Reels, that's been a bright spot for Instagram. And, you know, currently, we're seeing good growth globally, you know, strength in a number of different markets. But we've been making, you know, a lot of progress on Reels and have been happy with it, you know, on Instagram. In terms of the launch on Facebook, that's earlier stage. On the monetization front, we're just starting to roll out ads in Instagram, so it's earlier on that front and we really haven't gotten to a monetization point with Reels on Facebook. Sheryl, did you want to take the iOS 14 question? Sheryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer Yeah, I can take that. I mean, when you start at the top of this, you really have to think about what personalized ads are, and we think they're better for people and businesses and they're especially important to small businesses. They also can be delivered, can be done in a very privacy-safe way. There are two big challenges coming from these iOS changes. The one is targeting and one is measurement. I'm taking the second one first. On measurement, we think we can address more than half of that underreporting by the end of the year and make more progress in the years ahead. We estimate we're underreporting iOS web conversions. We believe that real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher. And so, we have to do the work to help clients measure these properly in order for them to really understand the outcomes they're getting and improving performance. And again, we think we can get, you know, a good chunk of that in this year and more in the next year. Targeting is a longer-term challenge. Our direct-response products are built on user-level conversions. And as a result of the iOS changes, we don't see the same level of conversion data coming through. So, we have to rebuild our targeting and optimization systems to work with less data. So, this is a multi-year effort. We're developing privacy-enhancing technology to minimize the amount of personal information we learn and using more aggregate or anonymous data, while still allowing us to show those relevant personalized ads and measure of effectiveness. In order for this to really work and benefit all businesses, it can require some cross-industry collaboration and more commerce tools and those are going to be longer-term efforts. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Operator, if we can go to the next question. Operator Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead. Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you so much. Maybe two, if I can. Maybe, Sheryl, following up there in terms of thinking, in terms of quarters or years on both the targeting and the measurement piece, can you help us just go one level lower in terms of what you're building, in terms of what's in your control to put on into the advertising ecosystem versus what might just take time for advertisers to adopt and get comfortable with and better understand the data that drive their business outcomes and how they allocate advertising budget? That would be for you. And then, Dave, maybe if I could follow up on opex and capex. Just how should we be thinking about the elements of core Facebook versus some of the things you're trying to build against Mark's vision for the long term with Reality Labs and how that might be a driver of permanence versus transient nature of opex and capex in the years ahead? Thanks so much. Sheryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer So, some of the technology, we can build ourselves. We build AI, we made continued investments in AI that help us maintain or improve long-term performance data. We're building some of our own commerce tools and those are tools we can build that we need other people to adopt. And then some of the targeting opportunities we see offset, take, you know, tools we can build or tools we can build in industry collaboration. We're really working as part of several industry collaborative groups on what those tools will look like and how those get adopted. So, those, obviously, take more partnership and are less in our direct control. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Eric. On the outlook on expenses in 2022, you know, it's, obviously, early but we wanted to give an, you know, an initial outlook of our expected expense range since we typically do that in Q3. You know, Mark outlined we have a lot of priorities that we're investing against across the business. That includes, you know, a lot of areas in the core sort of family of apps but also in apparel. We've got a lot of priorities in, you know, advertising, AI, commerce, privacy. So, when you kind of pull all these things together, we've got a pretty robust spending plan next year. The, you know, primary driver is going to be accelerating headcount growth in 2022. So, that's going to be something you'll see headcount coming in above 20 percent, obviously, that we have this quarter. And we also have -- expect to have higher expenses from, you know, office operations and travel once larger parts of the workforce are returning to the office in 2022. We're not providing a specific breakdown at this point for segment expense. Operator Our next question is from -- Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer And you got the next -- Operator Our next question from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please, go ahead. Doug Anmuth -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Great. Thank you. One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, just given the significant investments in both P and L expenses and capex, and clearly, you're talking about the heavy focus on metaverse over the long term, just hoping you could help us recap kind of the 1-year, 3-year, and then 5-year aspirations from a product perspective as you've done in the past. And then Dave, just on the 2022 expenses, which is about 29 percent to 38 percent growth. Do you have any commentary on revenue growth in '22 to go along with that? Thanks. Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer I can talk about the metaverse and Reality Labs part of this. So, for the next, you know, one, three years, especially, I think what you'll see is us putting more of the foundational pieces into place. This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us anytime in the near future. But, you know, we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor of the mobile internet, that it's going to enable social experiences that are the ultimate expression of what we try to build, which is allowing people to feel really present with the people they care about no matter where they actually are. So, we think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital and physical goods that would exist today and allow millions of people to be able to do work doing what they love and enabling a whole different economy around that that I think is going to be another important pillar of our business over the next decade. So, on the next, you know, one to three years, you know, I mean, I almost -- I wouldn't focus on the sort of business outcomes there quite as much as I would just, you know, that the products and the infrastructure that we're putting in place. So, there's -- there are new platforms, there's hardware components, there's the whole virtual reality product line, there's the augmented reality product line. You know, we're kind of starting to put those pieces in place. There's the operating system and development models for all these new creative tools. There's the commerce part of what we're doing around this and how they time to the broader commerce effort across family of apps. And then there's all the social platform work that we're doing with our Horizon effort that touches a bunch of different areas of what we're doing. But I think you'll see all of those pieces start to be built out and start to mature a bit over the next few years. And then, you know, if we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade, is when we would sort of expect this to be more of a real business story. But I think what we kind of think about it for the near term is are we delivering the product experiences that are completely groundbreaking and that people try this latest thing, that is amazing and can see a glimpse of where this is going. And that will pave the way for the future. The business North Star that I mentioned in my opening remarks are, you know, we hope that by the end of the decade that we can, you know, help a billion people use the metaverse and support hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce. And I think if we can do that, then this will be a good investment over there for the long term. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Doug, it's Dave. We're not, at this point, providing a specific revenue outlook for 2022. You know, we continue to see opportunities to grow both impressions and price next year, so we're obviously coming off an incredibly strong year of revenue growth in 2021. So, we do expect deceleration in growth in 2022 from the full-year 2021 rate. And there's, you know, there's sort of uncertainty implied in our range for Q4 revenue and I think that holds true for the 2022 outlook as well. There's a lot of factors at play, including advertisers working their way through the impact of the Apple platform changes. We're obviously navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment, we'll have a, you know, better sense of how these things work together as we get through the holiday season. But yeah, given the expense growth that we outlined, you know, which, you know, is implied in the 30 percent, you know, north of 30 percent, we don't expect revenue growth at that level. So, we would expect 2022 margins to be lower than 2021. Operator Our next question -- Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer France, you can get the next question. Operator Is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please, go ahead. Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Maybe one for Mark and one for Dave. Getting 18- to 29-year-old users is not easy. I wonder if you could maybe outline some of your strategies to kind of get some progress there. I know it's multi-quarter. And then, Dave, in your guidance for Q4, can you help us on the IDFA impact? You know, is it contemplated to be about the same as 3Q? A little bit better as you work on your measurement? Or is it a little bit more of a headwind in Q4? Thank you. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Justin. I can take -- yeah, I can take the -- I can actually take both of those questions. You know, in terms of the younger demographics, our products are, obviously, widely used by young adults and we remain focused on building out those product capabilities and continuing to focus on making our products relevant for that audience. I think Reels is a big part of that strategy and, you know, we've now got that -- we've got that rolled out in over 100 countries since launching in August of last year. And, you know, we're continuing to invest in that experience and make ongoing product enhancements. And so, that's probably one of our big focus points that I would point to. In terms of the IDFA -- Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer You know, maybe I'll just add -- Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer On Reels. Yeah, I think that this is going to be a very meaningful, qualitative change in how people use a lot of different products across the internet. I mean, I think every once in a while, its format comes along that allows new types of content, right? So, we saw this with News Feed, we saw it with Stories, and I think Reels is -- from everything I've seen, has the potential to be something of that scale where there are different flavors of it in different apps. But I think as a format, it can be very fundamental. And I think we're still closer to the beginning of that journey than we are to its maturity, you know, in terms of just having rolled out, you know, some of the initial tests and experiences and rolled it out in Facebook. And, you know, I mean, you mentioned all the countries that have been in Instagram but it's just continuing to grow very quickly. So, I think that that's going to be a big part of the focus here. And as we'll -- I'm excited over the next, you know, year or two to see how that grow into something. I would bet it will be like Stories is in our products today. Sorry, Dave. Go for it. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Justin. On the iOS question as it relates to Q4 versus Q3, you know, the bulk of iOS 14 updates were completed, you know, as we entered Q3, which contributed to the step-up and the impact from Q2 to Q3. Since iOS 14 is now widely adopted, we don't expect a similar step-up in Q4. But, you know, importantly, we haven't gone through a holiday season with these changes and prices are higher during the holidays given strong demand. And so, there's uncertainty how that will intersect with the challenges on targeting and measurement coming from the iOS changes. So, you know, I think that brings some uncertainty into the Q4 outlook that's reflected in our guidance range. Operator Our next -- Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer We can get to the next question, France. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please, go ahead. Youssef Squali -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Great. Thank you very much. Two questions for me. Mark, it's the week of Facebook Connect. I was hoping you can provide us an update on Horizon. This is the social app where people can create games and experiences to share together. When will that finally come out of the closed beta? I think it's been in for the last two years. It seems to us that to move Facebook into the metaverse successfully, you really need to have a VR social app that's obviously cool and successful. And the other question is around, again, this focus on 18 to 29. Can you maybe just speak to the current trends in engagement at both Facebook and Instagram among millennials and younger audiences? I know you're speaking about a focus on going forward, but how has it been trending of late? Thank you. Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer I'll take the first and then Dave can talk about whatever numbers you want to share. Though first, let me say I think we have, you know, on Thursday, at Nash, we're going to be going into quite a bit of detail about our vision for the metaverse and how we think we can help contribute to building this. So, I encourage all of you to tune in. Part of that that we are going to talk about is Horizon, how that fits into this. And we've been steadily working on this and onboarding more creators and more people to it and we're adding more worlds all the time. I mean, I think you're right that this is going to be a critical part of at least our platform and the work that we're doing here. We released Workrooms recently. I'm really excited about how that experiences come together. And I think, you know, to your point, you mentioned it's important to have a VR social experience. I actually think it's important to have an experience that goes across all of the platforms, right? So, I don't think we're going to end up with just a -- something that's like a VR social network. I think you want to be able to have these experiences where you, you know, you can feel present with people and have this immersive experience that's going to be best if you're in VR or in AR and you're a hologram. But these fields work everywhere, right? These fields work across our whole family of apps and these fields work on the web and on phones and on computers. So, there's a lot to do. And, you know, whether we call it beta or not, you know, I think the reality is we're going to be -- this is, you know, kind of similar to the question before about where we're going to be in a year or three years. There's a lot of foundational infrastructure that just needs to get built up here. And part of what we're trying to reflect in the segment reporting and all that is we're committed to doing this work, it's going to be a big investment, we want to be transparent about it. But we think it's very exciting and a huge opportunity for the future and I encourage you to tune in on Thursday to hear more. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer And Youssef, just on, you know, overall being the engagement trends, you know, our products are widely used by teens but we are facing tough competition from the like of, you know, TikTok, particularly, and Snapchat. And, you know, we're focused on, obviously, you know, continuing to innovate and roll out products like Reels and, you know, attract the younger demographics and retain the younger demographic for our products. And that's why we're continuing to build and invest in those areas. Operator Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please, go ahead. Mr. Mahaney, your line is open. Please proceed. Mark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst I apologize. Two questions. On the iOS changes, is it fair to say that that's the majority that accounts for the majority of the headwinds that you saw in Q3 and expect to see in Q4? And then secondly, a question for Mark. Just on the application of artificial intelligence to kind of help moderate -- content is the wrong word but, you know, to try to make sure that inappropriate content is removed from Facebook and Instagram, etc. Where do you think you are in terms of getting that to be where you want it to be? I know it's been a multi-year investment journey experience. You know, here we are several years later. Is the specificity in task, are -- you think you have been able to show success in using AI, you know, constructively? Thank you. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Mark, it's Dave. On the first question, yes, the Apple platform changes were the largest factor in terms of Q3 headwinds. I mean, it was really the first full-quarter impact of those new ATT policy changes following just the, you know, increased consumer adoption ramp of the iOS updates. You know, and if it really weren't for that, we would have expected sequential growth Q2 to Q3, so that was the largest headwind in the quarter. Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer Sure, and I can speak a bit to AI. So, I -- my answer is yes, I think it's made a big impact. You know, we issued these quarterly transparency reports, which, I should add, you know, we're industry-leading on this in -- both in terms of defining that and in terms of the depth of what we outlined that people can hold us accountable and kind of see the breakdown of how we're actually doing. But what we'll -- what we measure in those reports and disclosed is what percent of the content that we act on, is our AI or our internal systems finding rather than people have report it to us. Like in video, we have about a lot of people who already use our products. If they find something that's problematic and they report stuff to us. And it used to be before the last several years that, you know, most of what we did for community integrity was just respond to incoming reports but we decided, hey, we should really try to get in front of this and build really sophisticated systems so we're not just relying on people to tell us when there are issues so we can proactively go address that. And in most of these categories -- and we've basically gotten to the point now where, you know, 90-plus percent of the content where we've basically been, that we act on where, you know, identifying largely through the AI system. And it varies a bit by category. So, for categories like nudity, where it's, you know, relatively easier to train a computer to identify that, you know, the numbers are very high. Some of the categories like hate speech that have been harder because, you know, first of all, we're operating in -- and it's around 150 languages around the world. I also think it's, you know, there's a lot of cultural nuance in this where, you know, you want to be able to make sure you understand the innuendoes in all those languages and that you want to make sure that people can say -- can denounce racism, right? If someone is saying something racist to encourage someone to do something hateful, that's bad. But if you -- if someone wants to basically say, \"Hey, I saw this person doing this and people shouldn't be doing that,\" then you don't want to censor people doing that. So, it ends up being a very challenging problem. And for the first couple of years of working on this, you know, we're still at a relatively low recall rate where, you know, our AI systems had, you know, 10 percent, 15 percent of the content that we were addressing, we were dealing with proactively. But, you know, in recent years, the -- like the AI progress has been very impressive. We're now above 90 percent of the content that we take an action on there is also proactive even with hate speech. So, overall -- I mean, look, let me just -- let me take this question in a slightly different direction which is, I know that there is a lot of scrutiny of our efforts. And I guess I just want to say to the team and the people who work on this that I'm really proud of the progress that they make. I think we have the best people in the world and we're doing the best job of this, I believe, across any company in the industry. And, you know, I mean, I think this is an important area, there should be scrutiny on it, but I also think that any honest account of what's actually going on here should take into account that a huge amount of progress has been made and will continue to be made by a lot of talented people who are working on this. Operator Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Ross Sandler -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. Dave, one nit-picky question on the guide and then one kind of big picture for Sheryl, maybe. So, since we are now all focusing on the two-year CAGRs for -- the guidance for the high end of the fourth-quarter revenue actually has an acceleration on the two-year CAGR. So, I know we're talking about headwinds and IDFA and, you know, supply chains, and everything like that. But the sequential growth looks normal and then the two-year CAGR is accelerating. So, I guess, where is the strength coming from? And would you call that a strong 4Q environment? And then Sheryl, you talked about overhauling targeting longer term to have less focus on users or user base targeting and more contextual in kind of other things. I guess, high-level, how do you think that will impact the overall return on ad spend compared to pre-IDFA levels? And have you looked at Facebook's competitive position in the digital ad market versus some of the other large platforms, like any impact on the long term, you know, as you kind of retool the targeting? Thanks a lot. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Ross, it's Dave. We'd -- we're giving sort of, you know, specific quantitative revenue guidance on Q4. Yeah, I think if you look at the range, it's -- from a sequential growth basis, on a seasonal basis Q3 to Q4, it's lower sequential growth than we've seen historically. So, I do think that reflects some of the uncertainty that we're seeing out there as it relates to how IDFA -- sorry, you know, the iOS 14 and ATT and IDFA impacts play into pricing during the holidays, and also, the, you know, the macroeconomic factors like the supply chain issues. So, I do think the -- kind of the seasonal sequential growth is lower than we've seen in the past. And, you know, with the range, I think that reflects that uncertainty. Sheryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer In terms of the overall -- our overall targeting, I think it's hard to say here and decide exactly where we're going to end up at the -- all of this. It is going to be a multi-year effort. We've definitely seen a hit already and we're definitely focused on tools to help advertisers. We think we have opportunities to strengthen targeting ourselves, both by the work we do ourselves and as part of industry consortium. You're right in your question in that advertisers have to make a choice of where they advertise, so the question for us is how good can our targeting be compared to others. I think our targeting can suffer compared to others like Apple who have the direct data themselves, but I think our targeting still remains, I think, in very -- in many ways, very good for advertisers. When you compare us on ROI, we've always performed well. We still do, even though we've taken a hit, and we're focused on continuing to do that for businesses. Operator Our next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please, go ahead. John Blackledge -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, on the macro. Are you already seeing supply chain issues impacting 4Q ad revenue? Or, you know, do you expect them -- the issues to be more impactful later in the quarter? And then the second question on Instagram. Given the rise of Reels, is it cannibalizing engagement on the other Instagram services? Thank you. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, John. I mean, it's, you know, look, we're not, you know, we're not the, you know, macroeconomic authority on all things. I will tell you that what we're hearing from advertisers is they are -- or they are seeing, you know, supply chain issues that was true in Q3 and, you know, had an impact there, as well as we expect that to continue to carry over into Q4. There also -- obviously, that intersects with the challenges with the targeting and measurement headwinds from iOS 14. So, you know, it's hard to parse exactly how the platform issues and the macroeconomic factors will play into Q4, but I think those are the two biggest factors driving the range of potential outcomes that we've outlined in our guidance. In terms of Reels and other IG services, I can take a crack at that then, you know, if Mark and Sheryl want to add anything. You know, whenever we launch new experiences, this was true with Stories, it was true with, you know, Facebook Watch, you know, it's -- you're always going to see some amount of shifting of people's time and attention to the new areas. And, you know, we do think that that benefits the experience overall and we think that makes the overall experience more engaging over time and we do think that it's -- we're able to with Reels drive incremental engagement with Instagram and Facebook. So, that's why we're investing to do that. Operator Our next question is -- Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer France, we can go to the next question. Operator From the line of Mark Shmulik with AllianceBernstein. Please, go ahead. Mark Shmulik -- AB Bersnstein -- Analyst Yes. One for Sheryl, you know, specifically around kind of on platform commerce, in that pivot. And I know previously you've shared kind of merchant and user adoption metrics, but any progress you could share on that front as it relates to activity? Are users embracing it? And then the second question kind of more broadly around recruiting. You know, I know that the recent post to create kind of 10,000 jobs tied to the metaverse in Europe. Any particular kind of rationale for how you're thinking about recruiting kind of globally? Thanks. Sheryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer So, on commerce, we have a lot of commerce activity on our platform already. People are discovering lots of products through our feed and Stories ads. This is our largest ad vertical and COVID really accelerated it, but it's also been one of the fastest-growing verticals over a five-year period. We believe we drive hundreds of billions of dollars of off-site e-commerce gross merchandise volume today through our ads business. And we think commerce tools will be built and layered on top of that to help businesses reach more new customers and drive more incremental sales. In those commerce efforts, we're focused on three areas: continuing to be the best place to advertise, making it easier to sell on the platform, and improving the customer experience. And I think we're in different places on those. In the first, in terms of continuing to be the best place to advertise, we are a great place to find customers. We think the ROI is very strong and continues to be competitive. In terms of making it easier -- the second, to sell on the platform, here, we're catching up to other mobile and web shopping experiences. And I think we have some work to do there. And then the third, improving the consumer experience to encourage people to shop, I think we're also making progress there but we've got some room to grow. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer And, Mark, on the recruiting front, you know, obviously, we've got a, you know, big investment year planned in 2022. That's going to be largely driven by, you know, recruiting. We're going to have to do that globally. We're looking to build technical talent. We're going to be hiring people to do more remote work. And focusing on that, we're going to be, you know, investing in headcount, you know, outside of the Bay Area and, you know, continuing to focus on building our, you know, technical and product capabilities across the globe. Europe is an important part of that and that's why it was outlined in that announcement. Deborah Crawford -- Vice President of Investor Relations Operator, we have time for one last question. Operator Very good. Our last question then will be from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please, go ahead. Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. Dave, just on the capex up at midpoint over 70 percent. There are a lot of questions just as it relates to what the surge is related to there. Is there any more detail you can help us better understand that investment? Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Brent. I mean, you know, I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know, our 2022 outlook really reflects a, you know, a significant increase in our planned investments in areas like AI and machine learning. And, you know, a lot of that will be, you know, dedicated to, you know, investing in areas where we can use machine learning to improve, you know, ranking and recommendations to power experiences across our products in areas like feeds and, you know, in emerging areas like Reels. You know, we'll also be dedicating that to ads as we work to improve ads relevance and leveraging, you know, machine learning and AI to help balance out the loss of signal that we've experienced from some of the platform changes. So, we think that we can, you know, as part of sort of making our ads even more effective, you know, make up for that loss with a large investment on machine learning and AI side. And I think our position, you know, gives us a good ability to do that. So, that's really part of the logic behind the big increase in the capex budget next year. Deborah Crawford -- Vice President of Investor Relations Great. Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again.

A crypto platform Crypto Gaming United (CGU), which has joined the crypto exchange TimeX on the 18th of october, made $2.5 million in a record-breaking six seconds since public token trading began. One of the co-founders of the project is a crypto-currency, DeFi and blockchain app entrepreneur Sergei Sergienko born in Russia. CGU operates on the principles of uber-economy. Gamers don’t need to spend money on the initial purchase of NFT-characters. The platform rents them out to players in exchange for a share of their daily income. Meanwhile the games themselves reward players with income proportionate to their in-game skill and performance. The open market sale of GCU tokens became the third and final investment round. For context, previously the seed and pre-IDO rounds had ended at $5 million and $10 million respectively. The tokens released during these rounds have a blocking period with a 3 year rights transfer schedule. This means that CGU’s tokens are now only available on the secondary market. There were 10 million the GCU tokens available for sale in total, at the price of $0.25 each. In 6 seconds after the market opened, all tokens had been bought out. “Success of every project is always measured by the market. We never expected the demand to be high enough to sell all the tokens in under 6 seconds. This makes it even more pleasant to realize the importance of the gaming crypto platform CGU to the market, and to feel the support coming from the project’s community” – the co-founder of the project Sergei Sergienko notes. The next step for CGU according to Sergei is committing to the plan publicized in the token’s emission prospect – the company intends to increase the number of active players on the platform to a hundred thousand in the nearest future. The gathered funds will also be used for creation and development of CGU and DAO communities for the project. Overall, Crypto Gaming United attracted $17.5 million during the 3 investment rounds.

    "content": "NSW is doing what Labor’s Bill Shorten could not – explaining why Australia’s capital gains tax concession is knocking first home buyers out of homes. Shorten went to the 2016 and 2019 elections with a plan – Labor would halve the capital gains tax concession used by landlords who buy and sell properties. In much the same way as he was unable to sell his (now modest by international standards) plan to make half of all new car sales electric by 2030, he was pilloried by Morrision and before him Malcolm Turnbull for a policy they said would smash house prices. Shorten had similar trouble selling his (now modest by international standards) plan to make half of all new car sales electric by 2030 – it was going to “end the weekend”. He was pilloried by Morrison and his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull for negative gearing changes they said would smash house prices. All Shorten was proposing was to wind back the capital gains tax exemption (which exempts from tax half of each profit made from buying and sell real estate and other assets) for future transactions only. The exemption would stay in place for everything already bought. In the face of an overblown debate about whether or not it would smash house prices (Morrison’s department had quietly warned such claims were “not consistent with our advice”) the Labor leader found himself defending modelling about prices rather than outlining what his policy would actually do. And he lost, twice. Now, as we prepare for yet another election, the NSW Coalition government has done what Australia’s Labor opposition could not – make a cogent argument for winding back the capital gains tax concession, saying it “pushes first home buyers out of the market”. Elbowing first home buyers aside In a submission placed quietly on the federal government’s housing inquiry website late last week the NSW government argued that if the concession was cut, housing would be used “more for accommodation needs than investment needs”. Here’s the line of thinking it set out, the line Shorten was never able to get across. The income made from capital gains – from buying something, holding it, then selling it at a profit – is taxed differently from the income made from work or running a business. Only half of it is taxed. Prime Minister John Howard and his treasurer Peter Costello were responsible for the change, introduced in 1999 in the leadup to the introduction of the goods and services tax in 2000, but with less fanfare. Read more: Home prices are climbing alright, but not for the reason you might think Before then capital gains were taxed in the same way as other income (what they are subject to is income tax, there is no such thing as a separate capital gains tax). But before then only the portion of each gain over and above the rate of inflation was taxed, so that people weren’t taxed on a profit that would have no real value. Prime Minister John Howard halved the headline rate of capital gains tax. Brendon Thorne/AAP The change, introduced after an inquiry that found it would “encourage a greater level of investment, particularly in innovative, high-growth companies” was to instead tax only half of each capital gain. It was sold as a small change. A few years earlier, inflation had been big, around 8% per year, meaning that after five or so years only half of each profit would have been taxed in any event. But inflation had since dived to a barely-noticeable 2%, where it has stayed for most of the past 20 years, making a guaranteed exemption from tax of half of each capital gain made trading property away over the odds. It was, as economist Rory Robertson told his clients at the time, “almost as though the Australian tax system has been screaming at taxpayers to gear up to earn increased capital gains rather than to work harder to earn increased wages”. Instead of pouring into high-growth companies, as Howard’s inquiry said it expected, the money flooded into housing, which was easier to borrow for. Rushing into real estate rather than shares As Reserve Bank assistant governor Luci Ellis told a parliamentary inquiry, it was “more profitable to negatively gear property, because you can gear it more”. To buy properties quickly, real estate investors needed to buy properties that would have otherwise been bought to live in. It pushed up prices, but that wasn’t all it did. As the NSW submission to the current housing inquiry says, the most significant impact was “the displacement of owner occupiers (including first home buyers) from home ownership by tax-advantaged investors, predominantly those already on higher incomes”. In its words by encouraging investors to buy and hold property, the 50% capital gains discount increases investor demand for housing and pushes first home buyers out of the market Before capital gains tax was halved and Australians dived into becoming landlords, more than 70% of Australian households owned the home in which they lived and one quarter rented. At the latest count (itself four years old) only two thirds owned the place in which they lived and one third rented. Labor has new friends And properties are less well used. Because income from rent is no longer the chief motivation for holding property (these days most rental properties make a rental loss whereas before the capital gains tax change most made a profit) the NSW government believes more are remaining empty. Now, when the capital gains from holding properties can be measured in hundreds of dollars per day, it would be an ideal time to wind back the capital gains tax discount. Its absence wouldn’t much hurt. Read more: As home prices soar beyond reach, we have a government inquiry almost designed not to tell us why And it’s easy to forget that wasn’t what Labor was proposing. Shorten (twice) put forward something far more modest – leaving the tax discount for existing investments untouched and halving the discount for future investors. It’s no longer Labor policy, but it was backed by the head of the Coalition’s Commission of Audit and the head of its financial system inquiry. And it was of interest to the Business Council of Australia which pointed out that the discount “can distort investor behaviour, particularly at a time of rapid capital gains, such as in a housing or equity boom”. Morrison’s opposition to it was hard to justify at the time. It’s harder now.

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - Here, we have listed the seven most highly-anticipated seven-seater SUVs and MPVs that will be launching in the Indian market within a year For the automobile industry, 2020 was an extremely challenging year, and 2021 turned out to be only slightly better. However, the Indian market is expected to see a major recovery in the coming times, and many automakers are preparing to launch a few new models in the near future, in order to expand their customer base and keep their sales figures up. In recent times, the demand for 7-seater vehicles has increased in India, and many carmakers are already catering to these buyers. However, a few more 7-seater SUVs and MPVs are slated to go on sale in our market soon, the top seven of which have been detailed below. 1. Toyota Rumion Toyota launched the Rumion in South Africa just a few weeks ago. The MPV is essentially a rebadged version of Maruti Ertiga, with only tiny differences in the design, like a new front grille, and of course, new logos. As per plenty of news reports, Toyota will launch the MPV in India as well. The cabin styling of the India-spec Toyota Rumion will be unchanged, and the powertrain and platform will remain the same as well. The launch details aren’t clear yet, but this upcoming Toyota MPV is expected to go on sale in India some time during the next year. 2. Jeep Meridian Jeep introduced a Compass-based three-row SUV internationally in August this year, christened ‘Commander’. In the Indian market, this new SUV will be launched around mid-2022, under a new name – Meridian. The upcoming Jeep Meridian is expected to get a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel engine, with mild-hybrid assistance. A petrol engine option may also be offered here, although not a lot of concrete details are available about the SUV’s India-spec version yet. 3. Next-gen Mahindra Scorpio Mahindra & Mahindra is planning to launch the next-generation Scorpio in India, likely in the first half of 2022. The new-gen model is expected to share its underpinnings with the Thar, and will likely have the same engine options as the latter – a 2.0L turbo-petrol unit and a 2.2L turbo-diesel unit. The new model will be more premium and will have a lot more features on offer than the outgoing SUV. Upon launch, the new-gen Scorpio will be a more rugged alternative to crossovers like Tata Safari, Hyundai Alcazar, etc. 4. Mahindra Bolero Neo Plus Earlier this year, M&M launched a facelifted version of the TUV300 in our market, under a new name – Bolero Neo. We expect the manufacturer to reintroduce the TUV300 Plus as well soon, likely rebranded as the ‘Bolero Neo Plus’. This upcoming SUV will actually be more than a 7-seater; it will have inward-facing bench seats in the third row, similar to the Bolero Neo, but it will technically be a 9-seater vehicle, thanks to its extra length and wheelbase. 5. Toyota-Maruti MPV Toyota and Maruti are jointly developing a few vehicles for the Indian market, and one of them is a new midsize MPV. This new vehicle will be introduced as a rival to Mahindra Marazzo; it will be positioned above the XL6 in Maruti’s range and below the Innova Crysta in Toyota’s range. For representation only Details about the MPV are completely under wraps at the moment, but speculations suggest that Maruti will introduce it some time during 2022, and Toyota will launch a rebadged version of it a few months later. 6. Kia MPV Kia is planning to launch a new MPV in our country, expected to arrive during early 2022. Codenamed ‘KY’ this forthcoming MPV has been spied multiple times during road testing on the streets of India. The new Kia MPV is expected to share its platform with the Seltos, but modified to accommodate the extra row of seats in the back. The powertrain options are expected to consist of a 1.5L petrol motor and a 1.5L diesel mill, which are also available on the Seltos. 7. Hyundai MPV Hyundai is also working on a new MPV, codenamed ‘KS’, which will share its underpinnings and powertrain options with Kia KY. The MPV is expected to have its world debut next year, and it will likely go on sale in Indonesia first. India launch of this upcoming Hyundai MPV is expected to follow later, likely towards the end of the next year. Upon arrival, it will be a competitor to Mahindra Marazzo and even Maruti Ertiga, along with its Kia cousin.

Now I will turn the call over to Lip-Bu. Lip-Bu Tan -- Chief Executive Officer Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Cadence delivered strong financial results for the third quarter driven by accelerating customer demand for our innovative solutions and continued strong execution by the team. Driven by the broad-based strength of our business, we are raising our financial outlook for the third time this year and are now expecting about 11% revenue growth and 37% non-GAAP operating margin for 2021. John will provide the details in a moment for both our Q3 results and the updated outlook for the year. The data-driven era is being fueled by generational trends like 5G, hyperscale computing, autonomous driving and industrial IoT that are accelerating the digital transformation of several industries. This requires continued innovation in key areas such as compute, connectivity, storage, and data analysis, which in turn is driving secular semiconductor growth and design activity across a wide range of end markets. Before I ask Anirudh to go through the business and product highlights for the quarter, I would like to remind you that I will be transitioning to the role of Executive Chairman on December 15, with Anirudh becoming our President and CEO at that time. It has truly been an honor leading Cadence for the past 13 years and I'm very proud of the team's accomplishments and grateful for the confidence and trust that our customers and shareholders have placed in us. Cadence is extremely well positioned, and as I hand the baton over to Anirudh, I can think of no one better to lead the company through next phase of growth and I eagerly look forward to him taking Cadence to new heights. While I will remain engaged with shareholders, this will be my last earnings call. Thank you very much for your continued support and I will now turn the call over to Anirudh. Anirudh Devgan -- President Thank you Lip-Bu. Our Intelligent System Design strategy leverages our strong computational software expertise as we expand beyond EDA into new markets, and we're uniquely positioned to capture the exciting opportunities that Lip-Bu talked about. As we execute to our strategy, we are especially pleased to see our differentiated EDA, IP and systems solutions being increasingly adopted by a growing number of systems companies. For instance, Tesla utilized a broad set of Cadence EDA software solutions and hardware platforms to enable the successful delivery of their innovative Dojo system. Delighting customers and accelerating growth requires a relentless commitment to innovation. This quarter we launched the Integrity 3D-IC Platform, Tensilica AI Platform, Midas Safety Platform and the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio. We have now introduced 13 significant, innovative products this year across all of our business groups, and these will be key drivers of our future growth. Let me share some of the business highlights starting with Digital and Signoff, which had another strong quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Our digital full flow delivering industry leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes, continued to proliferate with market shaping customers, and was adopted by 13 new customers. We are very pleased with the growing momentum of our transformative Cadence Cerebrus solution, that incorporates unique reinforcement learning AI / ML technology, to deliver significant PPA, power, performance, and area and productivity gains. In addition to Samsung and Renesas endorsements at the time of launch, several market shaping customers have added Cadence Cerebrus to their production flows and are realizing great benefits. As an example, a global mobile semiconductor company used Cadence Cerebrus on their manually tuned CPU design to reduce total power by almost 10% and improved timing by over 25% automatically in only eight days. Additionally, Cadence Cerebrus enabled a marquee mobile systems company to reduce the power consumption of their 4 nanometer design by over 25% and get over 10 times improvement in productivity. We continued growing our business with hyperscale customers, including a broad expansion of our EDA software with a marquee hyperscaler, that included a significant commitment to our digital solutions. Next, I will talk about our Verification business, which had a strong quarter with 13% year-over-year revenue growth. Growing system design complexity and need to get first time right silicon, continues to drive strong demand for our Verification Suite, which provides a comprehensive solution across IP, SoC and system verification, hardware/software regressions, and early software development. This momentum especially noticeable in our hardware business, where customers are deploying significant additional capacity as they reap the performance, quality and productivity benefits of our industry leading hardware platforms. Accelerating adoption of our new Dynamic Duo, the Palladium Z2 and Protium X2, led by hyperscale and global marquee customers, drove the majority of hardware orders in this quarter. In Verification software, Xcelium-ML, our machine learning optimized logic simulator delivered up to 5 times faster regressions, was adopted by marquee customers in North America and Asia. We launched the Helium Virtual and Hybrid Studio, a new platform that accelerates the creation of hybrid and virtual prototypes of complex systems, enabling early software bring up. Helium was endorsed by Nvidia and several other engagements with leading customers are underway. We also announced the Midas Safety platform, which is part of the comprehensive Cadence Safety solution featuring integrated digital and analog safety flows and engines for faster certification or safety critical automotive designs. Moving on to System Design & Analysis, I am particularly pleased that this segment which is driving our market expansion beyond EDA, continues to deliver strong, double digit growth, increasing revenue by 17% year-over-year, as we grew our footprint in several verticals including Aerospace & Defense and 5G communications. With 5G and AI/ML applications pushing silicon reticle limits, and transistor scaling slowing down, there's an accelerated move to disaggregate SoCs into a heterogenous set of discrete die that can be integrated together with sophisticated packaging technology. Leveraging over two decades of pioneering packaging expertise, we're very excited to have launched Integrity 3D-IC, the industry's first and only comprehensive platform that ties together our best-in-class system planning, implementation and thermal, timing and power analysis technology, along with a multi technology database, all in a unified cockpit. This third-generation 3D-IC solution enables designers to achieve system-driven PPA with reduced design complexity and faster time to market, and we're engaged with several leading semi & system houses, foundries, and packaging companies. Our organically developed System Analysis products continued to make good headway, with Clarity, our electromagnetic 3D simulator, displacing the incumbent solution and becoming plan-of-record at a marquee hyperscaler. And Celsius, our electro-thermal 3D simulator, was deployed at a global marquee systems customer. Our recently acquired CFD solutions also delivered strong results, winning new business with several automotive, and Aerospace & Defense customers. And now before I turn it over to John, I wanted to say a few words about the upcoming CEO transition on December 15. On behalf of the Cadence Board and our employees, I want to thank Lip-Bu for his outstanding leadership and his numerous illustrious accomplishments over the past 13 years, that have made a lasting impact on our industry and on Cadence. With his laser focus on creating a highly innovative and results-based culture, he drove a cultural transformation at Cadence that was rooted in customer and shareholder success, leading to trusted partnerships with leading customers and delivering shareholder return of over 3500%. I am especially grateful to Lip-Bu for his mentorship and guidance and look forward to continuing our partnership in our new roles, as, along with our talented team, we relentlessly drive to deliver strong business results and delight our customers and shareholders. Now, I will turn it over to John to go through the Q3 results and present our Q4 and updated 2021 outlook. John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you Anirudh. And thank you Lip-Bu. They say values are like fingerprints nobody's are the same, but you leave them all over everything you do. Your impact on Cadence has been significant and will last for many, many years to come. It's been a truly remarkable run over the past 13 years, and I feel blessed to have had the chance to work so closely with you. I've also heard it said that legacy is not something you do for yourself, but it's something you leave for the benefit of the next generation, and on behalf of all Cadence stakeholders, I'd like to thank you both for conducting such a smooth CEO transition. We haven't missed a beat. Focused execution by the entire Cadence team, combined with broad-based strength across our product portfolio and customer base, drove another strong quarter of top and bottom-line results. We exceeded our expectations for all key financial metrics, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. Now let's go through the key results for the third quarter, beginning with the P&L. Total revenue was $751 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%, GAAP EPS was $0.63, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80. For the balance sheet and cash flow, cash totaled $1.014 billion at quarter end while the principal value of debt outstanding was $350 million, operating cash flow was $296 million, DSOs were 40 days, and we repurchased $110 million of Cadence shares during the quarter. Next let's turn to our updated outlook. Our outlook continues to assume that there will be no changes to the export limitations that exist today. For fiscal 2021, we now expect revenue in the range of $2.96 billion to $2.98 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%, GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.40, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.28, and operating cash flow in the range of $975 million to $1.025 billion. For the fourth quarter we expect revenue in the range of $745 million to $765 million, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.53, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.76 to $0.80, and we expect to repurchase $110 million of Cadence stock in Q4. Our CFO Commentary, which is available on our website, includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations. In closing, I am pleased that revenue growth continues to accelerate with our three year revenue CAGR now approximately 11.5% at the midpoint of guidance. We are expecting approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow for 2021 at the midpoint, and we are on track to deliver over 50% incremental operating margin for the year. As always, I want to thank our customers, partners, and of course our employees for their continued support. And with that, operator, we'll now take questions. Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Joe Vruwink -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Great. Hi, everyone. And let me just start by extending my best to Lip-Bu. Maybe I'll begin with the next generation hardware, its emulation and prototyping, I'm wondering, was component availability at all a factor in either meeting demand in the quarter or does component availability factor in at all to the forward outlook either in a good way catching up on maybe things that slipped this quarter or consider it maybe some demand getting extended into next year? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi, Joe. This is John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're delighted with the demand for our hardware verification systems and we're building the systems as quick as we can to meet that demand. We're very, very pleased with the customer reaction, like to billing the systems as quickly as we can. I'd say it's fair to say that demand is outstripping supply right now, but we're building as fast as we can. And you can see it in the inventory number, inventory is slightly up. Joe Vruwink -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe more of a product or strategy question, when thinking about 3D-IC and the co-design that needs to happen between package and chips being stacked, is it as simple when you think about the opportunity for Cadence is simple as customers adopting the new Integrity platform or is it may be broader than that, and this trend across the industry actually happens to impact in multiple areas of the Cadence product portfolio. Anirudh Devgan -- President Yes, that's a great question. Let me take that. This is Anirudh. So we believe that 3D-IC is the future, right. So the road to the future goes through 3D-IC for multiple reasons, which you know I mean putting multiple chips on a package believes it makes technologies ability to bigger and bigger systems. And I do believe that Cadence is uniquely positioned for that and it affects multiple technologies. Now some of it is because of our history. So we have had a leading platform in packaging for a while with Allegro and a leading platform in analog with Virtuoso for a while and then over the last five years, we have done very well in digital and then you could remember over the last two years, three years, we have done lot of investment in system analysis like Clarity and Celsius are also critical for 3D-IC, given that thermal is a big challenge when you put these things together. So I believe Cadence is uniquely positioned and with Integrity, we put this altogether. And it's not just Integrity, it draws into the other parts of Cadence like I mentioned. And then as a comparison, you know, and as we work with customers and leading foundries to do something similar in other products, it's not even one company you needed three or four companies to do the same thing, whereas if you come to Cadence we have a comprehensive solution across multiple segments. So I think as 3D-IC takes more momentum going forward, I believe we are well positioned. Joe Vruwink -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst That's great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Jason Celino -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. And Lip-Bu, it's been an absolute pleasure. Glad to have you on for one more earnings call. So my question with the supply chain shortages, we've seen several different automakers like Hyundai and Volkswagen announce intentions to design some of their own semiconductors. But we know that these design cycles are quite long and it's a multi-year investment. So how do we think about this as maybe an incremental dollar opportunity versus just market shift from customers taking some of those workloads in-house? Lip-Bu Tan -- Chief Executive Officer Jason, first of all, thank you so much for the kind word. In terms of the global supply chain, we monitoring the semiconductor global supply chain very carefully. So far we don't see any slowdown in our design activity across our customer base. And then as you know, our product is very much focused on the R&D engineering, designing the chip system. And so -- and this is a multi-year approach. And I mentioned earlier the generations drivers have been really driving a lot of increase in the design activity. And then answer your question in term of automotive by cycle, yes, you are absolutely correct it is a multiple year increment and then lately because of more and more electronics in the automotive. So we see a lot of design activity in autonomous driving. And I think Anirudh mentioned about the Tesla in terms of driving their AI chips and using our broad base Cadence tool. That's a one good example and many more coming. And so, I think clearly, we're excited about the automotive platform that will create opportunities in the multi-years to come. Jason Celino -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. And then, good, thanks for that. That was helpful and maybe my quick follow-up is I think the automotive customers have been maybe the one more vocal, but are you seeing these type of trends in other industries as well in terms of -- some with that? Thank you. Lip-Bu Tan -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think it is a very interesting challenging opportunity time in this whole supply chain. Clearly, for the automotive industry is starting to become a very realized that in whole visibility to the supply chain and become very important for them. And so in different automotive company they experience different challenges in the supply chain and we are here to help them in term of the design, automation and the whole system level complexity of design and then time to market. And then so we try to be available and be helpful to them as the design partner and also support them throughout this period. So I think you can see more and more opportunity in the automotive is a big platform for us. Jason Celino -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Great, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Jackson Ader -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Great. Good evening, guys, thanks for taking my questions. And I'll just quickly echo all the kind words that have already been said about Lip-Bu. Yeah, congratulations and looking forward to continuing the relationship. So Anirudh, you mentioned that in the last few years digital tools have been driving lot of growth and I think you also mentioned that hyperscaler this past quarter significantly increased their digital footprint. I'm just curious what tools or at least what parts of the digital design flow just from a high level of synthesis place and route, what have you are actually driving the increased uptick maybe in the last 12 months to 18 months in digital. Anirudh Devgan -- President Yes. Thanks, Jackson for the question. So I think as, as you know, like at lower nodes we have always believed that integration of the whole digital full flow is critical. So that's synthesis, place and route and signoff. So what we are pleased to see, especially in the last, let's say 12 months is wider deployment of our digital full flow. So we went back like few years ago the engagement would start within ours and that was the leading kind of products that we would do well in, but now I think overall market has accepted our full flow and we see more and more signs of that. So that includes, synthesis and signoff along with Innovus. And that is becoming more than norm than anything else. So to answer your question, not only Innovus does well, but now synthesis and signoff, which is Genus and Tempus and [Indecipherable]. We are pretty happy with the proliferation. And I think that's a trend here to stay. Jackson Ader -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst All right. Awesome. Thank you. And then, quick follow-up. John, can we just get -- what is going on with backlog and the implied bookings? It's really swung around a bunch this year. Just curious there were any duration impacts or what should we be reading into in terms of the implied bookings number this quarter? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Jackson thanks for the question. I wouldn't read too much into it. Again, it's like the timing of contract renewals. We had a similar phenomenon in Q1. We would expect to end the year with a higher backlog in RPO [Phonetic] than we started the year. And that's reflected as well. If you have a look at the margin guidance for Q4, margin guidance for Q4 is slightly down on what we achieved in Q3 because of the impact of some hiring and an expectation for higher sales commission costs in Q4 because we expect a lot of bookings to come through in Q4. Jackson Ader -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst All right. Awesome. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Pradeep Ramani from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Pradeep Ramani -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get some more insight on the verification piece, it seems like the verification for September was flattish to down a little bit versus June and yet hardware seems to be doing well. So I read to sort of interpret that it's more on the software side that you're seeing maybe less growth than what might have been anticipated or are you being constrained on the hardware side and I just want to get a sense about the ramp on the hardware side as well. John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi Pradeep, this is John. We're absolutely delighted with the customer reaction to our new hardware systems that and we're building and installing inventory as fast as we can to meet their demand, but I mean I'd remind you that Cadence is part of the design cycle. But, so I mean it hasn't really impacted us too much with our customer. And then in relation to your comments on growth, we raised guidance for the year. We're very happy with the growth we are seeing accelerating growth when you look at the three-year CAGAR and I have call them out in the CFO commentary, it's rounding up to 12% now. It's approximately 11.5% and that seems to continue to increase year after year and that's reflecting strong demand across all lines of business. Pradeep Ramani -- UBS -- Analyst Okay. So my follow-up on the digital ITP [Phonetic], I mean it has been very strong, are you seeing increasing competitors displacements or is it more of a market being strong, can you speak to maybe qualitatively on how you sort of viewing digital IP [Phonetic] going forward as well? Anirudh Devgan -- President Well, it continues to do well, like you saw. And I think it's a combination of things. I mean the market is definitely growing because of all these design activity as you can see in these multiple domain. So the market is growing and we believe that we are also taking market share. So I would say it's a combination of both -- both these things driving our digital growth. Pradeep Ramani -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Griffin Securities -- Analyst Thank you. Good evening. Anirudh, both of my questions are for you. But first on a personal note Lip-Bu, it's been a pleasure working with you for the last 13 years and certainly look forward to continuing the dialog with Anirudh. So first question Anirudh, at the Cadence Live Europe Conference a week or so ago, Cadence said in one of your presentations that Allegro had recently undergone a quote major overhaul, which you certainly saw with Allegro X. The question is what's next in terms of anything you might be working on for an additional major overhaul. We do see this periodically in EDA, for example, Synopsys, a few years ago significantly ramped up its internal investments in synthesis and they launched their new version of DC. And I'm wondering based on what seem to be your internal investment patterns, if you are undergoing a rejuvenation or reinvest in cycle for your synthesis or what else you might be able to talk about in terms of any major overhauls? Secondly, with regard to the ingredients, you need to succeed with the computational software strategy. There was an interesting announcement two weeks ago of relationship between Synopsys and Dassault, and I'm wondering if you see you're having to partner more for both technical and channel expansion reasons to succeed in computational software? Anirudh Devgan -- President Jay, this is -- both great question. I think in terms of new kind of you said new products or revamp of existing products. So we are continuously looking at that in all the time. We want to make sure all our products are doing well, as you can see this year. We have launched 13 new products. Several of them are improvement of existing products like Allegro X or Sigrity X, so I think this is a continuous process. As you know, we have a very high investment in R&D compared to our peers. So we are constantly looking at that and you know, you will see more things come out of course as we go forward. On the second one, we are confident in our computational software strategy delivering good results. I think we have a lot of organic ability to innovate which we demonstrated with Clarity and Celsius. And at the same time, we are definitely looking at a new partnerships that makes them like you said, both on the product side and on the go-to-market side. So I think we will talk about them. When they are ready, but Cadence always has a culture of partnering we partner for example with Matlab that was a great partnership at the system level. We partnered with National Instruments, when we bought AWR from them. We have partnership with Green Hills. So we are always looking for win-win partnerships and that continues to be the case going forward. Jay Vleeschhouwer -- Griffin Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Anirudh. Anirudh Devgan -- President Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Gal Munda -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Hello, thanks for taking my questions. Just first one in terms of the strong margin out performance again. And then kind of thinking about for the rest of the year. Maybe John to you, you mentioned that a little bit got to do with the timing, a little bit got to do with investment, but we are thinking kind of sustainability of the margin performance, how much of that kind of inability or maybe not being able to hire and invest as much as you'd like right now versus just the topline really driving the additional scale that you're seeing that makes sense? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Great, great question Gal. And we're back on track with hiring. I think our hiring performance has been really, really good and we're delighted to be recognized until many of these Top 100s places to work around the world. That's certainly helping us with our hiring activity. Yeah, on the margin side, it's really outperformance on revenue side on -- like right across all our lines of business. We thought IP would have a soft middle to the year and it would recover toward the end of the year, started recovering a bit earlier, but they had a strong finish to Q3 and we're expecting good things for them in Q4. On the hardware side again demand customer reaction has been tremendous and demand is really strong there. And on the software side, all lines of business are performing really, really well. And like you say over, if you look over a contract cycle over a three year CAGAR basis that we're continuing to see accelerated revenue growth. So on the operating leverage side, we're delighted with the operating margin performance. Second half of the year include some double op on expenses. We did an early retirement program, but I think the overall business is pretty much, I mean if you take out the one-time things we are operating pretty much at the guide we've given for the year, which is like 37%. Gal Munda -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Got you. And then as a follow-up just on the top line again, we've mentioned you touched a little bit on the supply chain issues in SMEs. And when you move kind of through the year, you said it's incrementally affecting the business on the royalty. Now we're talking about the hardware demand being stronger than kind of the ability to supply. Is there a way to kind of quantify that from your perspective in order to kind of understand that the magnitude of the impact that kind of demand is there, but we're kind of limited by the supply side. John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it is a very small impact to us like say the majority of our revenue comes from part of the design cycle. The chip capacity constraints that you're referring to is really impact the production side of the cycle and that's where it touches us in terms of royalty revenue. I think last year royalty revenue for Cadence was around $50 million, but this year it would be slightly lower than $50 million, but we'd expect that to recover again next year. Yeah, so the impact is pretty small. And then on the hardware side, we're happy with our supply chain, and you see inventory growing a little bit. We talked a couple of years ago about moving from just in time to just in case in terms of our inventory management. So we carry a lot of inventory. So we're, I think we're well protected, certainly for the next few quarters on the supply chain side, which we're very happy with where we positioned right now. Gal Munda -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Right. And just to clarify, the royalty nothing has changed over the last couple of quarters. Once you kind of said that the impact is being slightly down from last year, that's going to consistent to what you said? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That's right, that's right, I mean that there is -- our IP business is a mix of licensing and royalty business. And any chip capacity constraints from last year could feed into unit production this year and royalties are slightly down, but it's, it's very, very small in terms of the impact to Cadence on our overall numbers. Gal Munda -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. Thank you so much. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, guys. For different reasons, let me extend my congratulations for the next chapter for Anirudh and Lip-Bu. I wanted to start out by asking about the X2, Z2 products and the step function increase in processing power that these new tools facilitate. And the way I understand it allows customers to not only bring up hardware, but also in parallel bring up software. And so my question is can you give us a sense of the magnitude of how this increases the potential dollar opportunity with each customer engagement or how it improves your sort of available market with this new software bring up capability? Thank you. Anirudh Devgan -- President Yes, Gary, that's a good -- that's a great question and you're absolutely right, I mean the reason for doing also Protium X2 with having the same front end as Palladium is to expand our reach to more and more software bring up. And if you is this quarter when we launched helium that is for the same reason. So not only we can run RTL, but with helium we can run hybrid model, higher level modules with RTL. All this is for socket bring up. And historically I think Cadence has done well in RTL with Palladium, but not as well. The market is growing, more in the software bring up and now we are doing pretty well with Palladium -- with the combination of Palladium and Protium and helium [Indecipherable]. So I think in terms of the market of course it is difficult to quantify, but at the high level I think the market the opportunity is maybe 1.5 times to 2 times larger once you combine the software and the hardware bring up together. Of course it takes several years to fully realize all this, but I think the market opportunity for Cadence with Protium, Palladium and helium is much expanded because of the software. Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Right. I appreciate that Anirudh. And perhaps this is for John, but I want to ask about navigating the China export restrictions and maybe if you can give us a sense of whether it's any more difficult or any easier to obtain licenses to serve service those customers, based in China and then maybe give us a sense of what the various puts and takes are there for China revenue growth or lack thereof as we sit here in the second half of fiscal year '21? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Gary good question. Yeah, when I look at China to revenue, I think it is probably easier to look at China over a two year period because last year with the pandemic impact and the 53rd week impact in Q4, I think if you look at where we are on track for 2021 it is probably 30% CAGAR in terms of growth in China. Since 2019, we're working our way through all the export controls and everything that we and all the complaints that is required and we have and we will continue to comply with all export control regulations. But the situation is fluid and we have to continuously monitor it, but our outlook assumes everything that exists today remains in place today that we haven't -- we haven't predicted any changes that of course if there are changes, we would have to take another look at our outlook, but essentially for the sake of for the sake of guidance we just assume there like all export limitations that exist today for certain customers will remain in place for the remainder of the year. And then for 2022 we'll update you all in 2022 when we give you our year-end results in February. Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Thanks, John. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Tom Diffely from DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. So Lip-Bu I guess I've only been around for the last 12 years, but since then the stock gone from $6 to $167. So, obviously very impressive, but I look forward to Anirudh taking it $4,000 over the next 12 years to 15 years. So I guess a question on the supply chain from maybe a little different angle, what are you seeing in terms of capacity at the foundries? And just curious if you're taking steps to diversify foundry activity from either geographic or company-specific reasons? Anirudh Devgan -- President Yeah, that's a good question. I think we like Lip-Bu and John mentioned, we are more on the -- on the design side. So we are trying to make sure that we can serve all our customers as they continue to do all these design. And in that process we work with all the foundries, all the major foundries. Of course, in US and Asia and different parts of the world. So we have a pretty healthy relationship with all the major ones then. And we are encouraged to see more investment in the US. So with our overall position, Tom, we are pretty active with all the major foundries and we hope to continue that. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst I was wondering more on just the manufacturing of your chips that you design, build and put in your, in your Palladium's and what have you? Anirudh Devgan -- President Okay, got it. Yeah. So I think the current state of Palladium chips. I mean the Palladium has the big systems. So you've had lot of chips that goes into it. Some of them we buy and some of them we make ourselves. So the ones make ourselves are made by TSMC, which is one of the leading foundries and we continue to work with them and we are designing new system, the next generation of the two and we always look at all the foundry, but overall we are very happy with our foundry partners for the Palladium Z2 system. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Okay, great. And then, I'm curious, are you seeing an impact from COVID in any of the kind of mini region that you participate in around the world from just more of a manpower point of view? Anirudh Devgan -- President I think it's fair to say that the impact was more like a few months ago. I mean you still have an impact. We are still mostly of course working from home in several parts of the world and we are slowly opening some offices, but in terms of, we had a big impact in India, few months ago, I think that has thankfully in improved and so it's become more of the norm now, and we just continue to work to it. So no new things I think in the last three months. Our return to work was delayed a little bit because of Delta so we hope to take that up early next year and that we are working through all the COVID issues. Tom Diffely -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Okay. Thank you Anirudh. Anirudh Devgan -- President Thank you. Operator Your next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question, and I'll add my thanks and congratulations Lip-Bu. My first question, John or Anirudh, is really on that three-year CAGAR acceleration. And John, I know we've got to wait another 90 days before you give us a full outlook for calendar year '22, but it's impressive that you guys have seen this acceleration over the last two years in the midst of sort of a global pandemic. And if you look at Street consensus numbers for next year, they've got growth that goes back to that high-single digits, and yet you talked earlier about demand outstripping supply. Just wondering if you think these double-digit CAGAR are sort of here to stay and if so, to what extent is this sort of the fruits of your labor in some of your SAM [Phonetic] expansion efforts versus some of the dynamics of the core business? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John, that's a great question. Yeah, I think the nature of our revenue model is such that I wouldn't expect any dramatic changes in our next three-year revenue guide because 85% to 90% of the revenue is recurring in nature. So I mean when we calculate three year CAGAR by end of '22, we will be including '20 and '21 in that that. So you're not going to -- you shouldn't really have a dramatic change. And I think if you have a look at the, the CFO commentary, you'll see that kind of step function that we've seen over the last few years it's been slowly accelerating, but it's pleasing to see that it continues to accelerate and that we're just up over 11.5% now. So we are running up to 12% this year. So very pleased with the way the business is going. Again we will refrain on talking to anymore about '22 until -- we need another 90 days, just to get through -- just to get through Q4 for that, but have very, very pleased with the way it's going. And because of the recurring revenue nature of so much of our business, I wouldn't expect the three-year CAGAR to change pretty much. John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst That's helpful. And then Anirudh, I'd love to get your thoughts, clearly in the US and Europe have to have I guess rediscovered how strategically important, the semiconductor business is and you're seeing sort of this push to regionalization of supply, but it's not just about manufacturing. I think that world governments are going to incentivize sort of IP domestically as well. And so I'm kind of curious if you guys have kind of thought through or could help us think through what you think the impact to your business will be from things like the Chips Act and similar legislation that's trying to make its way through the EU right now? Anirudh Devgan -- President Yeah, that's a good point. And we are eagerly awaiting all the details, but if you -- as you know in the chip side there is funding for our manufacturing whether it's also funding for R&D and then as you said, it's not just the hardware or the manufacturing, movement, it's also the IP and the software that enables all these things. So I think we are optimistic about all this investment in different parts of the world. But I think the details as you know still had to be sorted out. But overall, we have a strong portfolio in multiple geographies. So, as there is more investment in US and Europe. I think that is in a systemically positive. John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John, that's agreed indication. I'm sorry. That's a great indication of all the design activity that's going on. I mean, we're seeing strong secular demand across all these generational drivers. We have a great strategy, great portfolio and solid execution that everything you mentioned kind of just indicates more design activity globally and that's good Cadence. John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks guys. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Charles Shi from Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question. Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So I want to go back to your prepared remarks, you mentioned about Integrity 3D-IC being the industry's first and only comprehensive platform for 3D-IC but a few days ago, your competitor put out a press release they said their product is a complete end-to-end solution. I just wonder how do I reconcile the two different comments around these two competing products. And in addition, your competitor, Synopsys they announced a strategic collaboration with TSMC yet folks obviously, we did not see a similar press release coming from you guys right ahead of TSMC opening that innovation platform forum, which will start tomorrow. So kind of kind of wonder what -- how your positioning and what's the progress of Integrity 3D versus your competing platform? Thank you. Anirudh Devgan -- President Yes, thank you. That's a good question. So in terms of Integrity, like I said in my remarks, I think we are pretty confident of our position. And you know lot of the 3D-IC thing, it's not one thing, it's a combination of lot of things. So for example, some 3D-IC systems are more package based, some are more package technology based. Some of them are more interpolar based, which is a more digital technology, but all in all, [Indecipherable] is the most unique platform. We are leadership in packaging with Allegro, with analog in Virtuoso, with digital in [Indecipherable] and all the analysis tools with Clarity and Celsius and they are all integrated and best of class solutions. So we are pretty confident of our position and the response, we are getting. And to your question with TSMC, TSMC is a great partner of Cadence. And we are working with them on a variety of things including integrity 3D-IC and actually to give you, example, one of the leading mobile customers did a 3D-IC solution with that with us and TSMC. And one of the key things there was the thermal profile and they used Celsius to do silicon validation that Celsius is accurate for 3D-IC temperature simulation. So I think 3D-IC is going big. And it requires multiple products and multiple implementation flows and we are pretty confident in our position. Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Thank you Anirudh. And maybe a second question. Not sure if this has been asked before since I recently just started following you guys, I want to ask a question about Intel. That the Intel IBM 2.0 strategy. I know you probably don't want to be too customer specific about that turnaround offered by Intel is too material more in my opinion, any thoughts on how Cadence can do to support Intel's turnaround efforts over the coming years. And if you don't want to comment Cadence specific maybe, maybe give us some color at the industry level? Thank you. Anirudh Devgan -- President Yes, thank you for the question. I think Intel, we are glad to do more with Intel. Actually they have the Intel foundry announcement and also some new programs like Ramsay with the government, and I'll just quote what is already public by Randhir, who is the Head of Intel foundry. It says along with our customers and ecosystem partners, including IBM, Cadence, Synopsis and others, we will bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain. So this is official comment from Intel and I think we let them speak for the strategy, but we are glad to do more of it. Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Our final question will come from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. And congrats and best wishes to Lip-Bu and Anirudh from my side as well. For my first one on your NUMECA and Pointwise acquisition and just kind of the general expansion into system analysis and CFD, could you give us a sense how big is it today? How big can it be over the next one year, two years and importantly, when does that start becoming accretive right to the 11% -- 11.5% kind of growth model that you have? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer [Speech Overlap] I'm just saying we're very pleased with the M&A integration for NUMECA and Pointwise, but not hugely significant from a revenue standpoint right now, but we would expect them to be accretive next year. Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst Got it. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think John, you mentioned some higher costs in Q4, are they one-off costs or do they become kind of the baseline as we start thinking about opex for next year? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, great question. I mean to slightly I expect slightly higher cost in Q4 versus Q3 partly due to we did a bit of catch-up in hiring in Q3. And of course anyone we hired in the second half of Q3 will have a full quarter of their expense in Q4 where you didn't have a full quarter of expense in Q3. So slight uptick for that. And then secondly I expect a little bit more on commission costs because we expect bookings to be stronger in Q4 because I would anticipate that we will finish the year with a stronger RPO then we started the year. So we're expecting a good bookings quarter in Q4, which will add a little bit of commissions expense and then also, we have slightly higher T&E than forecasted. Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst That continues into Q1. I know you're not giving Q1 guidance, but all else being equal, does that become kind of the baseline for going into Q1? John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I feel very good about the continuing operating leverage. I don't think there's any near-term ceiling on operating leverage. I mean, you will see that we're up to 37% now, but it's the fifth year in a row that we've delivered more than 50% incremental margins. So every dollar revenue growth from 2017 until now we're dropping through more than $0.50 of that revenue growth through to operating income. So as long as we're delivering incremental margins of over 50% that operating leverage will -- should continue to rise. Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst Got it. Thanks very much. John Wall -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to Lip-Bu Tan for closing remarks. Lip-Bu Tan -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It is an exciting time for Cadence with growing market opportunities and strong business momentum. Our Intelligent System Design strategy is playing out very nicely as we benefit from new opportunities in Design Excellence, System Innovation and Pervasive Intelligence, and an expanded total addressable market. We are proud of the innovative and inclusive culture we have built at Cadence and are grateful for the recognitions we've received over the years, including most recently being named as one of the World's Best Workplaces for the sixth time by Fortune and Great Place to work, as well as being named to Newsweek's List of Most Loved Workplaces for 2021. And lastly on behalf of our employees and our Board of Directors, we thank our customers and partners for their continued trust and confidence during these unprecedented times.

The chassis of the motorcycle has been completed unaltered, to comply with RTO regulations. The bike features a matte grey paint finish on the tank, side boxes, and fenders. The stock seats have been replaced by a custom single-piece unit. The actor’s name has been etched onto the side boxes, along with the word ‘Anna’ on the tank. A truly personalised touch indeed! The bike also gets an aftermarket LED headlight, along with aftermarket turn indicators and taillight. The engine assembly has been completely blacked out, and a custom exhaust has been installed. We also see a new set of wheels here – wire-spoked rims shod with beautiful white-wall tyres. The motorcycle gets a flat handlebar, with bar-end mirrors installed on it.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin WWE Raw Season Premiere Credit: WWE.com WWE Raw featured a Season Premiere with the first live show since the controversial finish to SmackDown. SmackDown saw an awkward WWE Women’s Title exchange between Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch turn nasty amid a reportedly heated backstage confrontation between the two top stars. Flair was reportedly escorted from the building by a WWE official. Raw also advertised a coronation for Queen Zelina, and announced a Fatal 4-Way Ladder Match between Finn Balor, Seth Rollins, Rey Mysterio and Kevin Owens to become No. 1 Contender for the WWE Championship . WWE Raw Ratings —Last Five Weeks October 18, 2021–1.593 million October 11, 2021—1.582 million October 4, 2021—1.857 million September 27, 2021—1.709 million September 20, 2021—1.793 million Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch Backstage Drama Fuels Charlotte-AEW Rumors ( Pro Wrestling Bits ) WWE Raw Total YouTube Viewership Last Monday—5,757,127 (Down from 7,972,131) Most-Viewed: Bianca Belair vs. Charlotte Flair (972,812 views) Least-Viewed: John Morrison wants to Share his Innermost Thoughts (117,197 views) Median Viewership: 334,166 views MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers Big E, Seth Rollins and New Raw Draft Picks Kick Off WWE Raw Despite being a Season Premiere, Raw opened like any other WWE Raw where one WWE Superstar was being interrupted by another. The only difference from a traditional Raw was Big E’s DJ Screw shoutout. The options for Big E’s title contenders became progressively worse with every entrant, but then a Ladder Match was announced featuring all the contenders which was so much better than any of the potential singles matches. The Dirty Dawgz def. Alpha Academy and The Street Profits WWE Raw beat two of its newest teams in favor of The Dirty Dawgz who I don’t think anybody will buy as a viable threat to RK-Bro. The Street Profits lost when Angelo Dawkins took the pin. Given recent reports of Montez Ford potentially becoming a singles star , this feels like the beginning of the end of the Street Profits. Zelina Vega def. Doudrop Zelina Vega as a Queen's Crown winner presumably means she'll get more mic time. This is not a good thing at all, it's a GREAT thing. Don't know about that accent tho. Corey Graves took exception to Jimmy Smith putting words in his mouth by calling Zelina Vega “tricky.” Queen Zelina needed help with the scepter to win this match, and I have no problem with that. Becky Lynch Faces off with Bianca Belair Becky Lynch’s title exchange with Charlotte was only mentioned in passing by Jimmy Smith, who referred to the awkward nature of the exchange. Becky Lynch appeared to be reverting back to her babyface mannerisms, but then quickly went back to turning this crowd against her. While Bianca Belair was the clear babyface in this exchange, these fans didn’t seem overly enthusiastic about cheering one over the other. They really just wanted to cheer both. Damian Priest vs. T-BAR New theme music was a theme throughout this show, and Damian Priest was a beneficiary. I consider it a downgrade. Watching a 6’7 T-BAR perform a moonsault, just days after the Lance Archer scare, made my heart jump. Fortunately, T-BAR pulled it off seamlessly. This was more less character development for Damian Priest, who snapped after the DQ finish and destroyed T-BAR. Carmella def. Liv Morgan Carmella also walked out withe new theme music, and in this case, it was an upgrade. Just days after announcing their engagement, Carmella and Corey Graves shared a moment at the announce table before it was interrupted by Liv Morgan. Carmella had trouble removing her creepy, bedazzled mask following a victory over hard-luck Liv Morgan. Keith Bearcat Lee def. Cedric Alexander Keith Bearcat Lee is a far more feral version of Keith Lee. Keith Lee had a mistimed tackle of Cedric Alexander, but other than that, this was an impressive-looking squash. Hopefully Lee is able to finally ride some momentum. Austin Theory def. Dominik Mysterio I’m really liking Austin Theory’s selfie gimmick. He’s doing a good job portraying a rude, disingenuous heel who “just wants to take a picture with his idol.” This was a rare Dominik Mysterio match where Rey Mysterio didn’t interfere and accidentally cost him the match. RK-Bro def. The Dirt Dawgz—WWE Raw Tag Team Championship This announce team really wanted viewers to go out of their way to watch Dolph Ziggler on a camel. Graves concluded that because The Dirty Dawgz competed earlier in the night, they weren’t necessarily softened up. Thats’t exactly what I though the definition of softened up was. Poor Riddle missed his signature kick while performing his comeback. Seth Rollins def. Finn Balor, Rey Mysterio and Kevin Owens All these former SmackDown stars could use a victory, but Seth Rollins feels like he needs it the most. Big E decided to hilariously turn his back to the monitor backstage while also watching this match. This was a really good main event, and by the end of it, the entire Houston crowd was really into it.",

    "description": "As cricket, cinema and crypto come together, the craze will only grow. It would be surprising if it didn’t.",
    "content": "On the slim chance that the growing crypto craze in the country had escaped you, you were probably drawn in in recent weeks.The crypto universe, in particular crypto exchanges, have zeroed in on India’s two biggest passions — cricket and Bollywood, as a way to further popularise cryptocurrencies, which continue to operate in a regulatory black hole in India.Had you have switched on your television set to watch any of the recent IPL matches, especially the India-Pakistan encounter this weekend, then you know what we mean.“Yeh Bitcoin Bitcoin apun ko samajh nahee aate re; Bahut hard hai,” says a young actor, who goes on to rap the message.“Bahut hard kuch nahee hai,” retorts Ranveer Singh channeling his persona from super hit film Gully Boy. He goes on to demonstrate a crypto exchange app and ends by saying, “Lag ja re, kuch toh badle ga!”Translation — Take to crypto, it can change your life.A few overs later, another crypto exchange hits your screen with its message. This one more direct. It says you can expect four times the return on a regular fixed deposit if you use products promoted by the exchange. One of the products this exchange offers is a “fixed income plan” for cryptocurrencies. Users can lock-in their cryptocurrencies for a certain period and get principal plus interest thereafter, the exchange promises.Yet another newspaper advertisement for a crypto exchange screams \"safe hai\" with an ISO certification stamp added for good measure. Whether it is talking about the exchange or crypto is left up to your interpretation. Soon enough, you’ll probably see Amitabh Bachchan pedalling crypto investments as well - he has recently been signed on by one of the exchanges. Ironically, Bachchan is also the face of the Reserve Bank of India’s campaigns advising consumers of safe financial practices.For those who eyeing NFTs or non-fungible tokens, you’ll likely see a host of mega stars offer fans their collectables ranging from audio recordings to video and more. Salman Khan has already done it. So has Amitabh Bachchan. Where these mega stars go, more will follow.Continue Reading. Read more on Opinion by BloombergQuint.",

    "content": "The Reserve Bank of India's latest guidelines on scale-based regulation for non-bank finance companies will allow for the larger non-bank lenders to be treated at par with banks, while also increasing supervision and compliance for smaller lenders. The guidelines call for creation of four layers — base layer, middle layer, upper layer and top layer. NBFCs will be placed in each of these layers on the basis of their size, business models and interconnectedness with the broader financial system. The level of supervision and regulatory minimum rises with each layer. While the top layer is expected to remain empty for now, the RBI can identify certain non-bank lenders which can be put there, depending on the risk they pose to the broader financial system.According to NS Vishwanathan, former RBI deputy governor, regulation in the NBFC sector has always been driven by three principles — depositor protection, systemic protection and consumer or borrower protection.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Patrick. A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Derrek, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. I am pleased to report our strong revenue momentum from earlier in the year carried into the third quarter. Third quarter revenue was $577 million, an increase of 22% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Growth was driven by businesses of all types turning to flexible workforce solutions as they grapple with worker supply challenges and a variety of uncertainties related to the COVID business environment. This dynamic, combined with new client wins, helped us deliver net income of $19 million in the third quarter versus $9 million in the third quarter of the prior year. And adjusted EBITDA was up $11 million year-over-year, with corresponding margin up 130 basis points. Before turning to our segments, I want to provide an update on the pace of our recovery and thoughts on key topics impacting our business. First, we are excited third quarter revenue for PeopleScout, our highest-margin business, surpassed pre-pandemic levels, up 9% versus Q3 2019. Volume across most industries are increasing due to high employee turnover, which is leading to an acceleration in demand from existing clients and new demand from first-time RPO adopters. Our hardest hit market, travel and leisure, was up 308% during the quarter, and new business wins were up 217% year-to-date, with annualized revenue of $38 million. At PeopleManagement, revenue was down only 1% versus Q3 2019. New business wins continue to be strong for this segment, which had $22 million of new wins in August, bringing the annualized total to $86 million or up 34% year-to-date. Revenue for PeopleReady was down 16% versus Q3 2019. PeopleReady has been negatively impacted by the workers supply shortage, which I will address momentarily, and increased COVID cases from the Delta variant, which peaked in the U.S. late in the third quarter. However, we continue to be encouraged by the demand within PeopleReady, specifically in the solar energy space. Renewable energy is a focal point for the Biden administration to reduce U.S. carbon emissions. We expect solar energy to be an area of growth to support this directive. We have serviced this industry for 15 years and have specialized teams and processes in place to capitalize on this market expansion. Now I'd like to take a moment to touch on worker supply. Like many companies across the U.S., we are experiencing pressure on worker supply. The shortage is especially hitting PeopleReady due to the short notice period we received from customers to deliver contingent workers. While fill rates have softened in recent quarters, revenue recovery has been steady as job orders have increased. It is difficult to gauge the pace and magnitude at which supply will rebound. Many workers supported through government stimulus were able to increase their savings, which afforded them the option to temporarily exit the labor force. Additionally, the Delta variant has been a contributing factor to the labor shortages. However, while still in the early days, since enhanced federal unemployment benefits ended in early September, we are seeing signs of supply returning. For example, in PeopleReady, billable associates are up 9% in October versus the Q3 weekly average. PeopleReady weekly revenue trends in October are encouraging as well, up 17% year-over-year versus a 14% increase year-over-year in September. We've launched programs to retain existing associates, reengage former associates and source new candidates, including attendance bonuses and rewards to our top performers, enhanced referral programs, enhanced recruiter incentives and much more. We are closely monitoring the situation, and we'll continue to provide updates. Next, I want to take time to address a potential vaccine mandate. The impact on our results could have a wide range of outcomes. There are many uncertainties, including whether the mandate will survive court challenges, when the mandate could take effect, the definition of a qualified employee and the costs associated with testing workers. We are actively communicating with national officials to understand the logistics behind the plan, and are well prepared to comply with the mandate if and when it takes effect. On a smaller scale, we have already successfully implemented vaccine tracking measures as some large clients have required that only vaccinated associates can be assigned to their locations. We will communicate more information as the mandate becomes more clear. Also, as announced on September 22, due to Brannon Lacey leaving PeopleScout to accept a tech company CEO role, Taryn Owen's role is expanding as she has been named President and COO of PeopleScout in addition to her President, COO position at PeopleReady. Taryn served as President of PeopleScout from 2013 to 2019 and led the organization through a period of substantial growth, global expansion and digital transformation. Taryn's track record of success, combined with her deep knowledge in recruiting and staffing, perfectly positions her to lead both brands into the future. Carl Schweihs will continue in his role as President and COO over the people management brands. Now let's turn to our results by segment, starting with PeopleReady. PeopleReady is our largest segment, representing 58% of total trailing 12-month revenue and 62% of total segment profit. PeopleReady is the leading provider of on-demand labor and skilled trades in the North American industrial staffing market. We service our clients via a national footprint of physical branch locations as well as our JobStack mobile app. Year-over-year, PeopleReady revenue was up 19% during the quarter. PeopleManagement is our second largest segment, representing 31% of total trailing 12-month revenue and 13% of total segment profit. PeopleManagement provides on-site industrial staffing and commercial driving services in the North American industrial staffing market. The essence of a typical people management engagement is supplying an outsourced workforce that involves multiyear, multimillion-dollar on-site or driver relationships. Year-over-year, PeopleManagement revenue grew by 7% in the third quarter. Turning to our third segment. PeopleScout represents 11% of total trailing 12-month revenue and 25% of total segment profit. PeopleScout is a global leader in filling permanent positions through our recruitment process outsourcing services as well as offering managed service provider solutions. PeopleScout revenue surpassed pre-pandemic levels with year-over-year growth of 108% in the third quarter. We are very excited about the accelerated pace of recovery. Shifting gears, I will now provide an update on our key strategies by segment, starting with PeopleReady. Our most important strategy at PeopleReady is to further digitalize our business model, to gain market share and improve the efficiency of our service delivery cost structure. The U.S. temporary day labor market is highly fragmented, and there are very few large players in the industrial staffing segment where PeopleReady competes, with the bulk of the market made up of smaller companies. These smaller regional companies are typically not able to spend the type of investment required to deploy something like our JobStack mobile app. So this, along with our nationwide footprint, is what makes us a leading provider within industrial staffing. Our goal is to use JobStack to deliver value through differentiated associate and client experiences, leading to increased market share and operational efficiencies. Since rolling out the application to associates in 2017, and our clients in 2018, associate adoption has grown to over 90%, and our JobStack client user count ended the quarter at 29,100, up 11% versus Q3 2020. We continue to focus on converting clients to heavy users. As a reminder, a heavy user has 50 or more touches on JobStack per month, whether it's entering an order, rating a worker or approving time. Overall, heavy client users account for 56% of PeopleReady U.S. on-demand revenue compared to 31% in Q3 2020. We've also seen continued growth in our digital fill rates, which have increased 3 times to nearly 60% with 940,000 shifts filled via the app during the quarter. With the foundation of our digital strategy in place, we've expanded our focus on how to better serve existing clients and reach new ones more effectively. At the end of the first quarter, we launched two market pilots that utilize centralized service centers responsible for recruiting, onboarding and local delivery. The service centers increase our accessibility as they operate 85 hours per week versus 60 hours for a typical branch. This enhanced go-to-market approach includes repurposed job roles with the creation of dedicated account managers, who are responsible for growing and building client relationships. We believe we will be able to use the cost savings from reducing non-client-facing roles to offset the cost increases from adding more client-facing roles such as account managers. This fundamental shift in how we deliver our services requires thorough training and changed management for our employees. While it is still early, we are gathering key learnings that will improve our operating model, leading to higher digital fill rates, increased productivity and higher customer satisfaction. We are excited with the progress of the pilots, and we'll continue to provide updates. Turning to PeopleManagement, our strategy is to focus on execution and grow our client base. Last year, we sharpened our vertical focus to target essential manufacturers as well as warehouse and distribution clients, and made investments in our sales teams to enhance productivity. With these initiatives implemented, we have broadened the strategy to expand our geographic footprint by targeting more local and underserved markets. We are seeing strong results as PeopleManagement secured $22 million of new deals in August, bringing the year-to-date annualized new business wins to $86 million, up more than 40% versus the three prior year comparable average. Additionally, we are investing in customer and associate care programs in an effort to better serve our clients' needs and improve retention. Turning to PeopleScout, our strategy leverages our strong brand reputation to capture opportunities in an industry poised for growth. Many companies reduced or eliminated their in-house recruiting teams during the pandemic. And now we are seeing companies return to hybrid and fully outsourced models. To capitalize, we made investments in our sales teams to expand wallet share at existing clients and obtain new clients. Our efforts are delivering results with annualized new wins of $38 million so far this year, versus the three prior year comparable average of $9 million. In addition, many of our clients were forced to reduce their employee base during the pandemic, especially within travel and leisure, our largest industry vertical. Our ability to hire large volumes of workers quickly has us well positioned to help our clients restaff quickly. This has led to a rapid recovery in the third quarter, where revenue exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 9%. I'll now pass the call over to Derrek, who will share greater detail around our financial results. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Patrick. Total revenue for Q3 2021 was $577 million, representing growth of 22%, driven by new business wins and higher existing client volumes. We posted net income of $19 million or $0.53 per share, an increase of $10 million compared to net income of $9 million in the prior year. Revenue growth and gross margin expansion contributed to the net income growth. Adjusted net income was $21 million or an increase of $13 million, which is greater than the increase in GAAP net income, primarily due to $4 million of government subsidies in Q3 2020 that were excluded from adjusted net income. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $29 million, an increase of $11 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 130 basis points, again driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Gross margin of 25.4% was up 210 basis points. Our staffing segments contributed 110 basis points of margin expansion comprised of 70 basis points from lower workers' compensation costs primarily due to favorable development of prior period reserves, and the remaining 40 basis points largely due to increased sales mix from our PeopleReady segment, which has a higher gross margin profile than PeopleManagement. PeopleScout contributed 100 basis points of expansion driven by operating leverage from higher volumes. SG&A expense increased 32%, which was higher than our revenue growth of 22% due to the severity of the cost actions taken in Q3 last year. In Q3 2020, our cost management actions produced a decline in SG&A of 31%, which outpaced the revenue decline of 25% for that quarter. Q3 2020 also benefited from $4 million in government subsidies, which were excluded from our adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA calculations. We are running the company more efficiently today than we did prior to the COVID pandemic based on numerous changes in how we operate and leverage technology. Compared to Q3 2019, SG&A as a percentage of revenue in Q3 2021 was 20 basis points lower despite having $60 million less revenue. Our effective income tax rate was 15% in Q3. Turning to our segments. PeopleReady revenue increased 19%, while segment profit increased 32% with margin of 70 basis points. Strong recovery continued across most geographies and industries with the hospitality and service industries, both above Q3 2019 levels. Construction grew sequentially but was down versus prior year, as projects have been delayed due to building material shortages. Segment profit margin benefited from lower workers' compensation costs. We're encouraged by our trends as we enter the fourth quarter. PeopleReady revenue was up 17% during the first three weeks of October versus growth of 14% in September. We also saw some improvement in worker supply. PeopleManagement revenue increased 7%, while segment profit decreased 48% with 160 basis points of margin contraction. During the quarter, supply chain challenges slowed the pace of recovery but are being offset by new business wins. PeopleManagement had $86 million of annualized new business wins through September, with $9 million of new business revenue recorded this quarter and approximately $30 million expected for the full year. The decline in segment profit margin is partially due to the severity of employee-related cost reductions last year, such as cuts in pay and 401(k) match as well as additional recruiting costs to stay ahead of the holiday surge given the tight labor market. Upfront costs associated with new business wins and a drop in same customer revenue associated with supply chain challenges are also impacting profitability. PeopleScout revenue increased 108% with segment profit up $9 million and nearly 1,300 basis points of margin expansion. Revenue benefited from strong recovery in our hardest hit industries, including travel and leisure, which grew over 300%. New business wins also contributed to revenue growth as PeopleScout delivered $38 million of annualized new wins through September this year versus $9 million in the prior three-year comparable average. New wins generated $5 million of revenue in Q3 with $28 million expected for the full year. Operating leverage and increased recruiting staff utilization contributed to the higher year-over-year segment margin. Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape. We finished the quarter with $49 million in cash and no outstanding debt. While our profitability increased compared to Q3 last year, cash flow from operations decreased largely due to a $60 million payment in Q3 this year for 2020 employer payroll taxes that were allowed to be deferred as part of the CARES Act. We also had higher levels of working capital associated with our revenue growth, and an increase in days sales outstanding since the beginning of the year, which was a multiyear level. Compared to Q3 last year, days sales outstanding was down two days. For additional details about our outlook for the fourth quarter, please see our earnings presentation filed today. We like where our business sits today. Our services are in high demand as businesses increasingly look for solutions to deal with tight labor pools as well as a variety of uncertainties, including COVID and supply chain challenges. Likewise, our technology strategies are making us increasingly relevant in today's business environment, and along with changes in how we operate the business, more efficient in delivering our services. Okay. This concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call now for questions. Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is unmuted. Jeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thanks so much. Patrick, in the prepared remarks, and forgive me, I don't have the exact quote, but I think you said something about fill rates softening in recent quarters. Can we get a little bit more color on that? Where were they before the pandemic? How low did they go? And where are they roughly now? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. The fill rates are quite a bit different between PeopleManagement and PeopleReady, so I'm going to distinguish between the two, of course, in PeopleManagement, we have exclusivity. And our fill rates had been running in the low to mid-90s, so call it, 93%, 94%. We saw those drop down into the high 80s, so 88%, 89% in that business. So most of that's driven by worker supply challenges in PeopleManagement. In PeopleReady, the situation is a little different because in many cases, we don't have exclusivity. So in some cases, it's a jump ball where we're competing for the same positions as other staffing providers are. And we typically run in the high 70s, low 80s in terms of fill rates in PeopleReady. We dipped down to our low point in the high 50s. We're now running in the low 60s. So call it, a 15- to 20-point drop in PeopleReady. I do want to point out though, we're starting to see some of the supply of workers start to unfreeze a bit. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that our October run rates in PeopleReady were stronger than what we saw in September in Q3. Our applications are up in the high single digits. Our worker supply is up in the high single digits in October. And so we're starting to see a softening. I think a lot of that has to do with the unemployment benefits that ran out in the first week in September. And we think it's going to take a couple of quarters for the situation to unfreeze more. But we certainly saw an uplift in October. And as people savings start to dwindle, and people feel a little more safe coming back into the work environment, we expect a nice steady incline for worker supply going forward. Jeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst All right. That's great to hear. And I guess to segue off of that, we've been hearing and reading a lot about wage inflation. Can we talk a little bit about how that's running for your company? And are you able to pass that through in a timely manner in terms of increased bill rates, or is there any lag there? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, I think that that is a question for Derrek to take. He's really well schooled on the details. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Hey, Jeff, it's Derrek here. One comment to Patrick's answer that he provided on the fill rates, and then I'll take the bill rate question. The fill rates have definitely dropped since we've entered this year for all of the dynamics that Patrick just mentioned. However, we also know that the fill rates have also dropped based on customer behavior. So what we're also seeing, though, at PeopleReady, since we're not exclusive, is customers putting those same orders in across multiple companies. So some of that drop is -- the majority of it actually is because of worker shortages, but some of it is also with customer behaviors. Just putting those orders in with multiple staffing companies hoping to get more fills total from more suppliers. When it comes to bill and pay rates, pay rates and bill rates in our PeopleReady business were up. I'm going to round here, there were just about the same, about 10.5%. So we are getting them passed through timely. We're pleased about that. There's been other periods of time where it has -- we've had big minimum wage increases. We've always got them passed through. There's been some lag at points in time. But in today's environment, we're getting the bill rates increased in lockstep with the percentage increase in the pay rates. Jeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And just one final question. You had a great slide on your balance sheet remaining strong. But I couldn't help noticing that the company hasn't repurchased any shares this year despite that and despite the strong cash flow. Can you talk about what's going on there, what your capital allocation strategy is? Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Sure. Let's talk about both the year and the strategy going forward. So you haven't seen any stock repurchases from us this year because we had a couple of big capital events to plan for. One was, last year, we had $60 million of payroll taxes that we were allowed to defer under the CARES Act. Half of that was due to be paid this year. We planned and did pay for all $60 million of it in Q3. We elected to pay the full amount because under the CARES Act, any losses in 2020 were allowed to be carried back to periods where the tax rate was 35%. So we elected to pay all of that off. That's a really good return for us paying that off and carrying it back. Then the second piece is the growth in our accounts receivable. We've had working capital surge and accounts receivable of about $55 million. So with well over $100 million of capital going to those two events, we didn't want to repurchase any shares till we got those behind us and saw what was going on with the operating environment. At the level that we're at right now, $49 million, we don't feel like we're overcapitalized. Takes about $30 million to run the company, so we feel like we're in a good position right now. Looking forward, though, returning capital back to shareholders is certainly a priority for us. So we're not going to build up an excess of cash balance here. We want to make sure we're returning that back to shareholders. And given the current tax laws that are in place today, our preference is to do that through share repurchase. Jeff Silber -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. Great to hear. Thanks so much for the color. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Good afternoon, Patrick and Derrek. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering with regards to the pilot programs in Chicago and Dallas, can you talk a little bit about how the revenue trends compared over there relative to the rest of the PeopleReady operations? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Mark. This is Patrick, for your question. Just a reminder for everyone, what we're doing with the market service centers. The first thing we're doing is we've expanded hours from 60 hours to 85 hours. We're also adding more client-facing resources and fewer nonclient-facing resources. So we're taking those savings and we're investing them more client-facing resources. We're also providing more consistent delivery training, coverage, things of that sort. The pilots are still what I would describe as sort of early phased, Mark. So we're not handing out or putting out revenue numbers for the pilots relative to the other locations. What I can tell you is we've learned a lot since we started the pilots at the end of Q1. We're going to continue to run those through the end of the year and early next year, assuming the pilots are where we want them to be, we're going to expand out on more of a national basis. But what we're doing right now is we're not giving out local revenue numbers. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Okay. But if -- presumably, if you're going to expand out, it would suggest that the results thus far are encouraging. Is that a correct assessment? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Well, it's been mixed. We've had some areas where the results are very encouraging, and then we've had some areas where they're not as encouraging. So we're trying to work through some of those issues and learnings where the results haven't been encouraging, and we're making mid-course tractions on those. So it's been a mixed bag is how I would describe it. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst What are the elements that are mix? Like what's going better and what's going worse? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Well, one of the challenges we ran into was around some of the, essentially, call center software that we had. Being -- when you're running a branch where you've got three people there, everybody kind of knows everything that's going on in that branch. When you expand out into an entire market where you've got essentially a market set of clients and a market set of workers as opposed to a branch set of clients and a branch set workers, there's a little bit of this loss in translation there. And one of the things we learned early on is we needed some better tracking software. So all of our folks that are working in the market center could have better access to what's happening with our workers and our clients. And so that was a big learning along the way that we had to make some midcourse corrections on. In terms of what went really well is the worker supply has really well. We weren't sure what kind of a drop off we may have by closing the branches in Chicago and Dallas, and to the degree that we were dependent on those branches to find local workers. And one of the things we found is that we probably overestimated that a bit. And we feel really good about our ability to attract workers locally without a branch network. And so that's one a little better than we expected. So there's been some areas that went better and some areas that haven't went as well. And the areas that haven't went as well, we've made some fixes and are seeing some good trending and are encouraged by the results. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Great. Appreciate the transparency. With regards to the JobStack, how -- if somebody were to ask you like what percentage of revenue is now derived from JobStack, and how you would characterize the margins for JobStack revenue that is totally independent of the branch operations to the extent that there's repeat business that's been automated, how would you characterize that? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Well, from a margin perspective, it's hard to say because the pricing and the bill rates and the pay rates that we're providing are very similar, whether it goes through JobStack or whether it doesn't. Where we have clear efficiencies is when clients are placing orders, when they're approving time, when they're placing orders after hours. I'll give you an example. We had a client the other day, a logistics and delivery company that placed an order last minute, late at night for 15 associates, it came in after hours. And within an hour, those jobs are filled. And the client was so impressed with that, that they ended up moving all of their business to us. And today, this is a $0.5 million a year client. And so when you see things like that, where we would have had to come in the next morning and have and jump on with some other providers, the fact we were able to fill it while our branches were closed and our competitors' branches were closed. To me, the biggest value for JobStack is the revenue lift that we get from taking wallet share to our existing installed base. The margin profile, again, bill rate, pay rate spreads don't necessarily differ between a job that's filled by JobStack versus one that's not. But clearly, when you look at the costs associated with filling positions, we're able to do it with fewer people. And the market service center is really going to allow us to take advantage of that because, as you know, we've only got a handful of people in our branches. So it's hard to cut a third of a person or a half of a person, but you can do that when you go to a market center concept where you've got dozens of people all working in one location. And so I think what we'll ultimately see some nice cost savings that come out, it's just been difficult to extract it up to this point where we've had small numbers of people in our branches. And can you refresh me what the first part of your question was, Mark? Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Yes. So just trying to think through the revenue that you would directly attribute to JobStack. A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Well, we've got some numbers we put out there around heavy users that essentially account for 56% of our eligible revenue. And we define eligible by the way -- we haven't rolled out JobStack in Canada -- or for some of our skilled trades. So if you exclude those two, heavy users account for 56%, which is where the largest chunk of our revenue through JobStack is coming from. So I think that's one measure that you might look at. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Okay. And then with regards to the thinking, the implications of JobStack through, as we look out toward next year and the following year, how would you envision the branch count evolving? And what sort of savings and -- could you end up getting from that? And how do you think about this the incremental revenue that -- if JobStack really hits, we could end up getting? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer I think that would be a good question for Derrek to take around some of the cost savings. And I can probably add some more color after you speak, Derrek. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yes. Hi, Mark. It's Derrek here. So a little bit of extra perspective on JobStack and the efficiencies that it's bringing. It's very hard to carve off the specific savings for JobStack. But if we stand back big picture and look at what we're running as far as revenue per employee and our PeopleReady business, we're running at -- if we look back quarterly all the way to 2017, over the last five years, this quarter is our highest quarter ever in revenue per employee. And that's comparing back to a time when PeopleReady's annual revenue was $1.6 billion. So the technology is definitely delivering efficiencies for us. As we take a look toward next year and the market pilots. To give you an approximation of the amount of SG&A that's in our field operations at PeopleReady, it runs about $200 million. We haven't given out any percentages yet. But if it was just, say, hypothetically, 10% coming from real estate savings and some other things, I mean that would be a very sizable amount for us. So I'm giving that hypothetically, but that gives you an SG&A base to take a look at. I think as far as productivity and cost savings, there's even more opportunities behind us. One of the other things that we're starting to take a look at too is the proprietary technology that runs PeopleReady's operating system. So think things like applicant tracking system, billing, payroll. When I say payroll, it's less about just calculating the paychecks. It's all of the work processes that go in around that. So we think there's some technology upgrades that would also deliver a lot more efficiencies here. So we haven't given out any numbers at this point in time, but we're very optimistic that we can run this business in a more efficient manner. And we'd be really disappointed if we didn't get above our EBITDA margin of the last cycle of 5.2%. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Great. And then I was wondering, just can you talk a little bit about just the guidance here for the fourth quarter or the lack thereof. And from a revenue perspective, what are you trying to get at in terms of -- we know what the historical pattern has been, but what could be different on a plus or minus basis relative to history. And how should we think about the sequential change in SG&A? Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yes. So from a revenue perspective, we've given an outlook -- actually, haven't given an outlook. We've just given an average out there, which you've taken a look at that excluding last year, our Q4 revenue -- excuse me, our Q4 revenue is about the same as Q3 each year. We've also provided some information that our staffing operations have accelerated by a couple of points going into October versus September. So while we haven't been giving revenue guidance really at all this year or since COVID broke out, we've been giving some sequential direction according to our history. And I think those two data points are the most important. And what was your second part of your question, Mark? Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Just the SG&A, how should we think about that in terms of the sequential change relative to the third quarter? Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yes. We've given an SG&A outlook of $126 million to $130 million. So in that twp, you can find those numbers in our outlook section. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst I'm wondering what's driving the change? Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Well, I was just kind of getting to that part. And our EBITDA adjustments, we're talking a big part about it is an extra $5 million. Half of it coming from some deferred compensation sales that will be taking place in Q4, and also some SaaS software implementation costs. So there's about $5 million -- or close to $5 million of extra adjustments for the fourth quarter. Mark Marcon -- Baird -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer You bet. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Josh Vogel with Sidoti. Your line is open. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon, Patrick and Derrek. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to build off one of Mark's questions there on the branches. Maybe just a little bit more color around potential timing. Like what do you have to see today from like a market dynamic and usage of your tech enablement capabilities to feel comfortable in pairing down the branch structure. And could we see this start to materialize in 2022? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Josh. This is Patrick. I appreciate the question. Well, we're looking at a number of metrics that we're tracking. So we're looking at client count revenue growth, associated count, average hours per associate, average bill rate, average pay rate, margins. We're looking at a whole host of metrics that are financial as well as nonfinancial metrics around client acquisition, client retention, expansion rates, things of that sort. So we started the pilots right at the end of the first quarter, and we've been measuring all of these metrics throughout the pilots, both in Chicago and in Dallas. In terms of sort of green lighting more of a national expansion, we want to see the two pilot markets, the trending for those in Q3 and Q4 get above the pilot group that we're comparing against, which is the rest of the U.S. branch network. So when we see that we're outperforming, then at that point, we'd be in a position to green light on a much larger scale. There's a few other nuances that we're about to start running some pilots on. As an example, we have some branches that aren't part of large metropolitan cities. So if you take Illinois as an example, Peoria, which is in the middle of the state, 2.5 hours southwest of Chicago, we only have one branch there. So one of the other things that we're looking at is could we support a branch like Peoria from a market service center in Chicago. That's an open item right now that we'll be testing in Q4. And so the first order of business was could we outperform in our metro markets with a market service center versus a branch network? And then secondly, for those locations that are not metro that are secondary cities, can we deliver services more effectively and more efficiently than through a local branch. And so those are the things that are being tested. And until we are outperforming, we'll continue to pilot and make tweaks and perfections before we launch on a large scale. What we're not going to do is launch on a large scale if we're not outperforming the current situation. And so those are some of the things that we're looking at. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst Those are good insights. Thank you. You certainly had very strong results across the three segments. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the -- little bit of margin compression we saw on a sequential basis. Derrek, you had some comments on it, supply chain issues. I'm just curious, when we look at Q2 versus Q3, was that supply chain issues that leaned on the margins at PeopleManagement? And also sequentially, we saw a little bit downtick in PeopleScout. I'm just curious what drove those. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Sure. The downtick at PeopleManagement, that certainly had something to do with it. Our same-branch revenue for PeopleManagement went negative in the third quarter. So -- and we're bringing on new clients as well as PeopleManagement. So the same-customer revenue is the most profitable and it's the one that really deleverages because we've still got the same amount of resources for the most part, running those sites, the revenue drops. And so all of those gross profit dollars fall to the bottom line without much offset on the SG&A side. From a PeopleScout perspective, as we gave a little bit of color on Q2, that was a really outsized margin quarter for us. But what we're turning in this quarter is probably more appropriate for the revenue side. So what we saw was just a huge surge in same customer volume. So we were getting great leverage, maybe a little too great across our recruiting base. And so it delivered some very, very nice margins. That business will still continue to deliver nice margins. But the Q2 margin expansion was a bit ahead of itself and not one that we can still make the same type of service level agreements with all of our customers as far as timeliness. So that's a little color on those two pieces of the business. Still [Speech Overlap] 130 basis of adjusted EBITDA margin we had for the quarter versus same quarter a year ago. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Your comments on the SG&A in Q4, I was just curious when the $5 million split between deferred comp and SaaS implementation, is that going to bleed into 2022? Or is it kind of just going to hit up in Q4? Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yes. Those costs, while the SG&A is going up, those are excluded from our EBITDA calculation. So they won't be dilutive to adjusted net income or EBITDA. The deferred compensation plan will be fully transitioned this year. We've been moving everything over to some company-owned life insurance policies for tax reasons the last two or three years. And so that will complete itself. And then the system cost, the extra $2.5 million -- $2 million, $2.5 million that we'll spend there. We could do some more implementation costs and likely will next year toward some SaaS-based systems, but those two would be excluded from the SG&A. And those would not be recurring costs that would continue with us once the systems are stood up. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst All right. Great. And then just a couple of quick ones on -- around the vaccine mandates. I know you had some commentary there, Patrick. I guess you talked about tracking measures and stuff like that. But what's the dialogue you're having at the client level, both big and small? And if this is something that does materialize, do you think it could be a net benefit for you? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Josh, I appreciate the question. So there's a lot of unknown pertaining to the mandate that should get cleared up in the next couple of weeks. And until those get cleared up, it's difficult to say the magnitude and timing of the impact. But a couple of things to note, though, from an RPO perspective, we've talked with a number of our clients and -- this could be a potential tailwind for us as certain clients have indicated that they expect much higher than normal attrition, which would increase hiring volumes. And of course, we get paid a fee for each hire. And so the more churn there is at our clients, the more revenue and volume that we run through PeopleScout. So hard to predict, but it looks like if this ultimately gets implemented, there's the potential it could be a nice tailwind for PeopleScout. Related to our staffing business, it's just too early to know. There's so many uncertainties, things like here's a complication. Would you count the site as the 100-employee threshold or the staffing provider? So as an example, we have a lot of small landscaping companies that would be fewer than 100 employees. So would our 100-employee count matter? Or would it be theirs? Because it would be odd for us to send workers to their site and our workers have to be vaccinated, but theirs don't. So that's an open item. How about working home people for our corporate staff. We don't really know. The definition of an employee, if we take the Obamacare definition, it would have a very small impact on our workforce. If it's -- they work an hour for us and the account, it would have a larger impact. And so it's hard for me to say on the staffing side of the business until we see the specifics because there's just so many unknowns that could go so many different directions that it'd probably be premature for me to try to guess what OSHA is going to come up with in terms of their rules. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst No, that's helpful. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty and moving parts there. And you kind of led into my next question is taking PeopleManagement out of the equation and looking at PeopleScout and PeopleReady, and I guess this is a question you can't really answer because of the definition of an employee, but I was curious what percentage of those clients fall below the 100-employee threshold, but I guess you can't answer that right now? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Well, I don't have that number handy. I can tell you that if the definition for an employee was the Obamacare definition, we would be in the single-digit percentages of our employees impacted. And then you factor in the percentage of those that are already vaccinated and all of a sudden your it into a very small number. If it turns out -- it's the other extreme where it's -- they work one hour and they're considered an employee, then the impact would be a lot larger, and we'd have to do some workarounds for sure. The one thing I'd like you to take away is we're well prepared for this. We've been doing this already for clients that have come to us and said, \"hey, only send us vaccinated employees.\" It's been more prevalent in PeopleManagement than in other places, but we're certainly well prepared to operate in this environment if the mandate survives the court challenges. I do want to just follow-up on one question you asked earlier about the margins in PeopleManagement and PeopleScout. Derrek touched on this a bit. But sometimes those go down for a good reason. We've had a lot of wins in PeopleManagement and PeopleScout that are in implementation in Q3, also some in Q4. And so just know that the quarter-to-quarter can look kind of lumpy from time to time because of a large implementation or a couple of large implementations. And we saw some of that in Q3 for sure. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst I appreciate the follow-up on that. I guess just one last question around the potential for vaccine mandates, another way to kind of look at it. If it is perhaps put in place in certain states but not others, can you give me a sense of your geographic exposure to, I guess, blue states versus red? A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. I think that would be a good question for Derrek to answer. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer No, Josh, I don't have it sliced that way. I'd have to check into that one and get back to you. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst No worries. I didn't mean to catch you off guard on that one. And that's -- A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Well, we do have our [Speech Overlap] by state, though, Derrek, don't we, that we could use as kind of a proxy to give Josh a sense of what our revenue is, particularly in People -- Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst Yes. Like maybe your top give states in terms of revenue or top three states or two states, like California, Texas, New York. Derrek L. Gafford -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Yes. Those would be, California at 14%; Florida, 13%; Texas at 9%; Illinois at 3%; and Washington at 3%. From there on out, they're all 3% and 2%. I'd have to run up some calculations. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti -- Analyst That's perfect. Well, thank you, guys, for taking my questions. A. Patrick Beharelle -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Josh. Operator [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Beharelle, I turn the call back over to you. A.

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - MG Hector, Hector Plus and Gloster prices have gone up substantially this year and the latest price hike makes them more expensive MG Motor India debuted back in 2019 in the domestic market with the Hector midsize SUV and its range was expanded with the arrival of the ZS EV early last year. Capitalising on the good reception for the Hector, the six- and seven-seater versions were introduced and only a few weeks ago, the SUV portfolio was strengthened with the Astor. The Astor is nothing but the petrol version of the ZS facelift sold in the international markets and is aggressively priced against rivals such as Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Nissan Kicks, Renault Duster and others. While its prices remain unchanged (between Rs. 9.78 lakh and Rs. 17.38 lakh), other models have seen a rather substantial price hike. The Hector, Hector Plus and Gloster are subjected to a price increase of up to Rs. 50,000. The Smart and Sharp variants of the Hector have witnessed a jump of Rs. 8,000 while the two-tone Sharp trim costs Rs. 50,000 more taking the prices to Rs. 13.50 lakh for the entry-level trim and Rs. 19,36 lakh for the top-spec model (ex-showroom). The Smart variant of the MG Hector Plus has encountered a price hike of Rs. 15,000 and the Sharp two-tone trim becomes more expensive by Rs. 42,000. Consequently, the Hector Plus is priced between Rs. 15.39 lakh and Rs. 20 lakh (ex-showroom). The Hector Plus’ range has also seen the elimination of Super six-seater 2.0L diesel MT and Style 1.5L petrol hybrid seven-seater. The Gloster flagship full-size SUV competes against Toyota Fortuner, Mahindra Alturas G4 and Isuzu MU-X in India, and courtesy of the latest price surge, it now costs Rs. 40,000 more. It does not affect the entry-level Super grade though. Thus, the MG Gloster is priced between Rs. 29.98 lakh and Rs. 37.68 lakh (ex-showroom). The British manufacturer owned by China’s SAIC increased the prices of the Hector and Hector Plus by up to Rs. 43,000 earlier this year and the Gloster’s price went up by around Rs. 80,000 in the month of May 2021 as well. MG could further expand its SUV portfolio and a sub Rs. 10 lakh electric vehicle also appears to be in the pipeline for launch in the near future.

It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day. Rental car giant Hertz was a shell of itself before emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year, but on Monday it flashed the latest sign of a rapid turnaround by placing an order for 100,000 pricey new Teslas to add to its fleet. Markets viewed the deal as good for both firms, but the biggest winner may be the electric carmaker's mercurial CEO, Elon Musk, who inched closer to becoming the world's first trillionaire. From Hert to Spurt The Covid pandemic hit Hertz hard last year when it halted traveland car rentals dried up. On top of that, the company had just spent big bucks on Detroit muscle, leaving it with less gas in the tank than rivals Avis and Enterprise which remained solvent. But fortune did a U-turn in 2021: Travel rebounded and a new investment group took Hertz out of bankruptcy with a $5.9 billion investment, the company lined up another $10 billion in loans while reducing its corporate debt by 80%, and sold 200,000 vehicles just as used car prices skyrocketed. The Tesla deal has sparked Hertz's fortunes: The more than $4 billion order will deliver snazzy, environmentally friendly Tesla Model 3 sedans over the next 14 months, making a fifth of its global car fleet exhaust-free. In trading Monday, Hertz shares were up 7.3% to $26.50. \"Since there is a lot of focus on [the environment] from investors, having 20% of your fleet being electric gives Hertz a stronger ESG investment narrative potentially than others in car rental,\" said Hamzah Mazari, a Jefferies analyst, in an interview with Barron's . Elon-gated: A week after Morgan Stanley predicted he'll be the world's first trillionaire, the net worth of Tesla's CEO and the world's richest man Elon Musk got a quarter of the way there on Monday. At $252 billion, he's worth almost $60 billion more than runner up Jeff Bezos. Meanwhile, Tesla stock was up 6.7% to $969 and its market cap passed $1 trillion for the first time.",

He announced on Monday that he's entering the pharmacy-benefit manager (PMB) market, which bargains with Big Pharma over the cost of your blood pressure pills (you know, the ones you take because you're so stressed by the cost of your blood pressure pills). Tanks a lot The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company — yep, that's really the name — enters a sector dominated by three more colloquially monikered players: CVS' Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts, or UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx. And those managers are on the hot seat: several states, including Ohio, Oklahoma, Georgia, New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, and Mississippi are probing whether their pricing and rebate practices are transparent. To counter those concerns, Cuban's new firm is pledging to keep its books crystal clear: The company will provide every detail of its operating costs to clients, and give them 100% of the rebates it gets from drugmakers. It is also launching its own online pharmacy to sell 100 of the most commonly prescribed generic medications, charging customers a 15% markup and a $3 fee on top of what it negotiates directly with generic manufacturers. \"We decided the only way to get our drugs to the people who need them is to build a parallel supply chain where we have control of all the intermediary players and ensure the same level of transparency at every level,\" Alex Oshmyansky, the company's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal . A Shark's Lark: True to his reality TV form, Cuban tapped Oshmyansky, a radiologist, to run the company after he sent the billionaire a cold pitch email with the PMB idea. Who knows, it could work as well as that time Cuban spent a day managing a Dairy Queen .",

It's a reversal of a decades-long trend of rapidly increasing college tuition costs compared to minute increase in inflation: This year marks the first time the overall inflation rate was greater than the average college tuition increase since the nearly 15% inflation rates of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since 1980, the cost of college tuition has increased 1,445%, while overall consumer prices have increased just 337%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation Gap Year: The gap may be explained by a matter of good timing (or bad, if you ask a university's accounting department). Most colleges set their tuition prices by May — meaning college students could have been spared the summer's extra inflation percentage points ushered in by the Delta variant, supply chain snags, and labor shortages.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A view of a large cylindrical oil tanks in an industrial yard. Bettmann Archive If the world is serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the fossil fuel industry is the place to start . Fossil energies provide 83% of the world’s energy — and 73% of the world’s greenhouse gases (GHG.) The oil and gas industry provide 57% of the world’s energy — and 50% of the world’s GHG. Oil and gas companies: 25% of their GHG comes from their production and distribution of oil and gas products. But 75% of their GHG comes from burning their oil and gas products (in cars or gas-fired power plants, domestic gas heaters, etc). But an additional set of numbers has just come out that suggests the fossil fuel industry is heading in the wrong direction. It’s called the Production Gap report (Figure 1). Figure 1. Production gap between GHG cuts needed to keep global warming between 1.5C and 2C and ... [+] fossil fuels planned to be produced (top lines). Source: SEI, IISD, ODI, Climate Analytics, CICERO, and UNEP. SEI The UNEP production gap report, conducted by the Stockholm Environmental Institute (SEI), evaluated 15 large energy production countries including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and UK against the Paris Agreement of 2016. MORE FOR YOU Here’s The List Of 317 Wind Energy Rejections The Sierra Club Doesn’t Want You To See Revisiting The Blame For High Gas Prices Why Do ‘Fracking’ Opponents Ignore Its Moral Benefits? The report has been summarized by BBC . To keep global temperature rise below 1.5C by the year 2100 would require a 45% cut in total global GHG emissions by 2030 based on 2010 levels. But these 15 countries are planning to produce more fossil fuels (110% more, which is double) than would be compatible with a 1.5C rise. The same plans would produce 45% more fossil fuels than required to keep the temperature rise to 2C. Over the next 20 years, coal production will drop, according to plans, but oil and gas will increase and gas will increase the most. A lead author on the report states that “global coal, oil and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C.” In Figure 1, the two dashed lines show the production plans in the first report dated 2019. It does reveal a slight improvement from 2019 to 2021 but the lines are still headed in the wrong direction and the production gap has not changed much. The dilemma. The dilemma is the world needs fossil fuels. If oil and gas production stopped suddenly, the world would starve because food is transported by semi-trailers or by rail or by ships that mostly run on oil and gas. There are two bookend options to this dilemma. The first and obvious option is to cut-back production of coal, oil and gas enough to meet the Paris agreement. The “fossil industry needle” would go down from 1 towards 0. The second option is to top-up production of coal, oil and gas but get rid of the GHG that they produce. That is, maintain production with all its benefits, but bury the GHG in a safe geological layer that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. The “fossil industry needle” would go up from 1 towards 2 because of the additional CCS technology needed. The cut-back option for fossil energy . Denmark , leading the world in wind power, recently stopped exploration for oil and gas, and plans to finish oil production by 2050. Wind power creates 50% of their electricity, more than any other country (US is 7%). They also plan to build an artificial, green energy island, starting in 2026, that would collect and store energy from an offshore wind system, for a cost of $34 billion. Norway has a strong oil and gas industry, called Equinor, but most of it is exported. Hydropower supplies 67% of their in-country energy. But Equinor are developing offshore wind systems, even partnering with the UK’s bp to supply electricity to New York City. Bp has committed to be 40% invested in renewables by 2030. That spells a big stop in oil and gas production. They are working on plans for a large blue hydrogen plant at Teesside in the UK that will by 2030 provide 20% of UK’s hydrogen that will be used in transportation. Other European majors, including TotalEnergies and Shell, are integrating renewables into their future and cutting reliance on oil and gas production. Figure 2. Rail containers of oil against backdrop of wind turbines in north Texas. I Palmer The top-up option for fossil energy. In the US, the oil and gas industry is hesitant about production cut-backs, and many are downright skeptical. Some of the reasons: · Cutbacks lose profits, jobs, and industry – the price of oil right now is close to $85/barrel. · Success of the shale revolution – the US became self-sufficient in oil for the first time since 1947. · Oil and gas are available, inexpensive, and reliable — cheap gasoline for cars and diesel for semi-trailers, as testified by recent traffic on highways. · The moral case – oil and gas availability offsets energy poverty in poorer parts of world. · Trainwreck climate events in 2021 are judged to be just statistical outliers, with no additional climate-change cause needed for explanation. And the long-term global data on droughts, wildfires, superstorms and hurricanes do not support a trendline of increasing intensity or frequency. Books have been written to deny or challenge the climate crisis. · The petrochemical industry, based on oil and gas, provides clothing, health and pharmacy products, and ubiquitous plastics used in construction, offices, homes and cars. This industry won’t be easy to replace by renewables. So is there an alternative to cutting production? Yes there is, and it’s called carbon capture and storage or CCS. This is the top-up option. Carbon capture and storage means collecting GHG (usually CO2, the dominant component) and burying it deep underground. “Bury” means to inject CO2 down a well where it’s contained within a non-leaking rock layer and it eventually merges chemically with the rock. The rock layer may be a depleted oilfield or a saline aquifer. CCS has a natural fit in the US because the oil and gas industry have been doing it for decades, in the form of enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, CCS doesn’t stop the emission of GHG from fossil fuels. It doesn’t stop the production of fossil fuels. It just captures and buries the GHG that comes from burning the fossil fuels. That’s why its termed the top-up option – conceptually it enables production of oil, gas, and coal to continue, and even expand. Whichever bookend option the US chooses, CCS will be needed to compensate for, or offset, the leftover fossil GHG emissions when the year 2050 arrives — CCS is an escape hatch. CCS futures for US. The US has plenty of storage capacity just in old oil and gas fields. US now emits 6,000 Mega tonnes per year (Mt/year) of GHG and this entire amount could be stored each year for 23 years. But new pipelines to transport GHG would have to be built or old natural gas pipelines retrofitted. While 45Q tax credits from the US government exist and will help — $50/ton of CO2 injected by CCS, or $35/ton if it’s used for EOR – but the cost remains expensive and carbon-pricing would probably have to be mandated. ExxonMobil is storing 9 Mt/year of CO2 each year, equal to 11 million car exhausts each year. The company plans to invest $3 billion for 20 new CCS facilities and some of these will bury CO2 from hard-to-abate industries, such as cement or steel plants. Occidental Petroleum are building a direct-air-capture wall of fans in West Texas that will suck in air and separate the CO2 for underground injection. They envisage a new CCS business that will assist other companies to get rid of their CO2. There are twelve commercial CCS projects currently in operation in the US in 2021, most tied to EOR. There is big money for CCS in the new 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill passed by the US Senate recently. CCS future across the world. Currently, 65% of CCS occurs in the US, with 10% or so in each of Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. CCS in 2020 stored only a puny 40 Mt/year. Rystad predicts it will need to be 8,000 Mt/year by 2050 - a total increase by 200 times. This would represent a 20% growth in CCS year-over-year. The numbers are staggering, but to make it happen a huge CCS industry would have to develop and would end up as big as the present-day oil and gas industry. So if this is the route chosen, the world will end up with one huge oil and gas industry plus one huge CCS industry. The “fossil industry needle” will becomes 1 + 1 = 2. This is mind-boggling. Is there a middle ground ? The above two scenarios are extremes. The likely result by the year 2050 will be somewhere in between. A few pointers that will likely influence the result: · A rush of oil and gas production until 2030, when government policies (carbon-free electricity) and stakeholder pressure by banks and people votes say, “You need to move faster!” · In the US, Biden’s policies on decarbonizing electricity and vehicles would drop the demand for oil and gas by 34-39% within 10-15 years (in press). If supply follows demand, this would mean a big decline in oil and gas production. · Bp and DNV who analyze this stuff say oil and gas will remain in 2050 at 36-46% of global energy. · Natural gas will be a halfway house through 2050. The largest component of fossil energy will be roughly flat from now through 2050 and by then will provide 21% of primary energy (in bp’s “Rapid” scenario) compared to 45% for renewables. European oil and gas companies will continue to diversify into renewables. US companies will resist this in favor of CCS, fixing methane leaks, and cleaning up their own operations carbon footprint. Legacy US energy companies will stay focused on oil and gas production, to sustain the shale revolution profits and jobs as a first priority. But by 2030, the US industry will be forced to rethink about divesting from oil and gas and reinvesting in renewables. Looking to Europe, they will see proactive companies that are even now leading the way.",

Simulations Plus, inc ( NASDAQ:SLP ) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Greetings, and welcome to the Simulations Plus Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Brian Siegel from Hayden IR. Thank you, Mr. Siegel. You may begin your presentation. Brian Siegel -- Investor Relations of Hayden IR Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 financial results conference call. Hosting the call today are Simulations Plus's CEO, Shawn O'Connor; and CFO, Will Frederick. An opportunity to ask questions will follow today's presentation. Before beginning, I would like to remind everyone that except for historical information, the matters discussed in this presentation are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words like believe, expect, anticipate mean that these are our best estimates at the time, but that there can be no assurances that expected or anticipated results or events will actually take place. So our actual future results could differ significantly from those statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to our ability to maintain our competitive advantages, acceptance of new software and improved versions of our existing software by our customers, the general economics of the pharmaceutical industry, our ability to finance growth, our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical staff, our ability to identify and close acquisition on terms favorable to the company, and a sustainable market. Further information on our risk factors is contained in our quarterly and annual reports and filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. With that said, I'd like to turn over the call to Shawn O'Connor. Shawn? Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Brian. We had an encouraging end the fiscal year, as we saw continued momentum in our Software business, and the decline in our Services business was less than we saw in the prior quarter. For fiscal 2021, our total growth -- total revenue growth came in at 12%, exceeding our guidance of 5% to 10%. Software revenue growth for fiscal '21 was 28%, exceeding our guidance of 20% to 25%. And the service revenue decline was 6%, slightly better than our guidance of 7% to 12%. Our Software business had a good quarter, reflecting the strength of both GastroPlus and ADMET Predictor, each growing by at least 20%, partially offset by the expected decline in MonolixSuite, due to early renewals that occurred in prior quarters. Software revenue growth in fiscal 2021 increased to 28%, compared to last fiscal year's growth rate of 17% and 11% in fiscal 2019. GastroPlus revenues grew 20% in the fourth quarter. And we attribute this strong performance to our industry-leading technology and focused upselling efforts, which produced 14 new commercial contracts during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, GastroPlus also saw 17 peer-reviewed journal articles, reflecting the strength and recognition of our industry-leading PBPK platform. ADMET Predictor revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 26%, as it continued to benefit from the Q3 product release that added valuable new features and functionality. Additionally, I want to emphasize that both GastroPlus and ADMET Predictor continued to expand their strong leadership position in the market during the year. For example, we saw 20 multi-year GastroPlus licenses signed, three new $100,000 plus customers, and 14 upsells during the year. And our new DDI module has been very well received, all of which are a strong validation of our leadership position. As anticipated, MonolixSuite revenue declined in the fourth quarter, due to early renewals in prior quarters. For the full year, revenue growth was 20% as we continue to see both new commercial client adoption as well as displacing alternative products and taking market share from our primary competitor. Turning to our Services business. As a reminder, our Service revenue is non-recurring. Accordingly, this business can exhibit volatility both quarterly and annually. PKPD projects are typically in the $100,000 to $200,000 range, and QSP/QST projects can be significantly larger. Sometimes, these projects are accelerated, delayed or even canceled by our customers based on their internal priorities or timelines and are not under our control. While it was a challenging second half of the fiscal year, due to the end characteristic events of the third quarter with higher-than-normal customer project delays and cancellations, we saw signs of optimism during the fourth quarter. As revenue decreased less than expected, our backlog grew again sequentially and our pipeline continued to build. During Q4, we saw the number of customer project delays and cancellations return to normal -- more normal levels. We also had a good bookings quarter, highlighted by closing five new clients, which contributed to a 10% increase in backlog for the quarter and a 49% increase for the full year, which was about 110% of our internal target. During the quarter, we also provided critical support for a multi-regional regulatory approval and supported an FDA submission for a new COVID-19 therapy. For the year, we took action and made several operational improvements that drove margin enhancements, leading to increased average contract value, project yield and consultant utilization rates. For the QSP/QST business, revenue was down in Q4 as expected. Despite this decline, we saw positive signs that point to an inflection point in this business. We had one new and one renewal of DILIsym consortium members during the quarter. And overall pipeline activity accelerated, reflecting strong momentum as we enter fiscal 2022. We are also seeing toxicology project opportunities picking up and have multiple QSP projects in late-stage proposal status. I'm also encouraged that we have already achieved our bookings target for Q1 of the new fiscal year. And finally, our PBPK business saw a 63% increase in backlog for the year and finished strong with two significant FDA-funded projects announced during Q4. Looking to fiscal 2022, modeling and simulation adoption continues to be strong in the pharma and biotech marketplace. Internal modeling and simulation resources continue to grow, and they are seeking out our software platforms to achieve their objectives. Outsourcing also remains a robust part of our clients' efforts to meet their needs, and we're here to support them with our Service business. Our Software business carried strong momentum into the new year, as we continue increasing our revenue growth rate as a result of enhancements to our technology, ongoing product portfolio expansion both internally and through acquisitions, and investments in our sales and marketing efforts. In fiscal 2021, our service business experienced the downside of what can be a volatile business, but we saw no fundamental changes in the market that would prevent this business from returning as a positive contributor to revenue growth in the future. Despite this decline in fiscal 2021, we enter the new year with increased pipeline activity, a rebuilt backlog that should drive sequential revenue growth on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2022. With these positive tailwinds, the financial outlook we are providing today anticipates a recovery of our Services business and growth accelerating sequentially as the fiscal year progresses. We expect to return to double-digit growth in total revenue in the range of $51 million to $53 million, reflecting 10% to 15% year-over-year growth. We expect Software to be in the range of 55% to 60% of total revenue and Services to be in the range of 40% to 45% of total revenue. And finally, we will continue our successful M&A strategy to expand our software portfolio and service offerings and grow our overall market opportunity to broaden our capabilities and further support our clients. Of course, any acquisition would be incremental to this outlook and with future acquisitions, we believe we can continue to grow at a pace that supports our CAGR target above 20% that we've achieved since the Cognigen acquisition in fiscal 2015. Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Will Frederick to discuss the financial results. Will Frederick -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Shawn. Total revenue growth rate for the quarter was 3%, due to the challenges in our Services business in the early MonolixSuite renewals that occurred in prior quarters. Software revenue growth for the quarter was 14%, and Services revenue declined 7% for the quarter. We continue to see improvement in our Software and Services revenue mix, with Software now at 55% of total revenue for the quarter. Our total revenue growth rate for fiscal year was 12%. Software revenue growth for the fiscal year was 28%, and Services revenue declined 6% for the fiscal year. For the fiscal year, Software is now at 60% of total revenue. For the quarter, Software gross margin increased from 83% last fiscal year to 85% this fiscal year, due to the increased revenue in that business. The Services gross margin for the quarter decreased from 61% to 55%, due to the revenue decline in that business. The revenue mix trends positively affected our total gross margin for the quarter, which remained at 72% comparable to last fiscal year. For the fiscal year, Software gross margin increased from 87% last year to 88% this year. And the Services gross margin for the fiscal year remained unchanged at 61%. The revenue mix shift had a greater impact on total gross margin for the fiscal year. And our total gross margin increased from 74% to 77%. For the quarter, GastroPlus represented 57% of our Software revenue, ADMET Predictor was 22%, MonolixSuite was 15%, and other software was 6%. For the year, GastroPlus represented 59% of our Software revenue, ADMET Predictor was 18%, MonolixSuite was 16%, and other software was 7%. We continue to enjoy solid revenue growth and diversification across our entire portfolio as evidenced with the software mix change since last year when GastroPlus was 66% of our Software revenue, and MonolixSuite was only 7%. We continue to see improvement in our average revenue per customer again this quarter with an increase from $62,000 to $65,000 for commercial companies and from $42,000 to $55,000, including non-profit and academic customers. Our renewal rate for the quarter based on fees was 90%, up from 88% last fiscal year and what has been higher except with five customer renewals slipped into the next quarter. Our renewal rate this quarter based on customers was 77%, down from 93% as expected, with our recently announced University+ program that offers free access to our software for students and educators as part of our ongoing support of academic research, training and collaborations. We believe this program will increase modeling and simulation education and help prepare the next generation of scientists and contribute to the rapid development of safer, lower cost treatments for patients worldwide. With this program, we saw a decline in paid non-profit and academic renewals and will exclude them from our reporting beginning next fiscal year. For the fiscal year, we also saw improvement in our average revenue per customer, with an increase from $111,000 to $121,000 for commercial companies and from $69,000 to $85,000, including non-profit and academic customers. Our fiscal year average revenues per customer are higher than those for the quarter, due to larger deals that occurred during the fiscal year. Our renewal rate for the fiscal year based on fees was 92%, down slightly from 93% last fiscal year, due to the customer renewal slippage for the five customers I just mentioned. Our renewal rate this fiscal year based on customers was 83%, down from 89%, primarily due to non-profit non-renewals as they transition to the University+ program. Let me shift now to our Services business. For the quarter, our Services revenue breakdown was 53% from PKPD services, 25% from QSP/QST services, 16% from PBPK services, and 6% from other services. For the full year, the breakdown was 49% from PKPD services, 28% from QSP/QST services, 14% from PBPK services, and 9% from other services. With regard to a couple of key Service metrics, total Services projects completed during the year increased 36% compared to the prior fiscal year, which increased 24% compared to fiscal 2019. We've started breaking out other projects this fiscal year that were previously reported in PKPD, QSP/QST or PBPK to provide additional visibility to this increase in activity and reflect the continued expansion of our Services offerings. We ended the fiscal year with $13 million in backlog, up $2.5 million from the prior fiscal year-end, reflecting a 24% increase and nice recovery from the decline we saw at the end of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Now turning to our consolidated income statement. SG&A expense for the quarter was $5.6 million or 57% of revenue, compared to $3.7 million or 39% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. Approximately $700,000 of this increase was a catch-up this quarter, as a result of switching from a semi-monthly payroll to a biweekly payroll during the fiscal year. As part of our integration efforts and One Company focus, we consolidated our payroll for all US employees and move to a biweekly payroll. The true-up with seven payroll periods in Q4 is reflected in the quarter and has no impact on our fiscal year expense. We've also seen cost increase since last fiscal year in insurance, external professional fees, recruiting and stock comp expense. Lastly, we had salary increases during the fiscal year to remain competitive with increasing market salaries, and we increased our headcount by nine employees during the fiscal year from 137 to 146. Total R&D costs for the quarter were $2 million or 20% of revenue, compared to $1.6 million or 17% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. R&D expenses for the quarter were $1.3 million or 13% of revenue, compared to $0.9 million or 9% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. Capitalized R&D for the quarter was $0.7 million or 7% of revenue, compared to $0.6 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. Income from operations was $0.2 million compared to $2.2 million in the same period last fiscal year. This decrease was primarily driven by the higher SG&A cost I just described, plus increased spending on R&D to support our product development efforts. The income tax benefit was $0.1 million for an effective tax rate of negative 73%, compared to an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and effective tax rate of negative 7% in the same period last year. We continue to see a lower effective tax rate, primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with disqualifying dispositions that we've seen throughout the fiscal year. Net income was $0.3 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period last fiscal year. And diluted earnings per share was $0.01 compared to $0.11 for the same period last fiscal year. EBITDA was $1.1 million compared to $2.9 million for the same period last fiscal year. For the fiscal year, SG&A expenses were $20.6 million or 44% of revenue compared to $16.4 million or 39% of revenue last year. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of higher payroll-related expenses, due to increased compensation to remain competitive with increasing market salaries and the increased headcount I just mentioned. We've also seen cost increases since last fiscal year in contract labor, insurance, professional fees, and stock compensation expense driven by our stock price during the fiscal year. Total R&D costs were $6.9 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $5.3 million or 13% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. R&D expenses were $4 million or 9% of revenue, compared to $3 million or 7% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. Capitalized R&D for the year was $2.9 million or 6% of revenue, compared to $2.3 million, also 6% of revenue in the same period last fiscal year. Income from operations was $11.3 million compared to $11.6 million last fiscal year. Income tax expense was $1.3 million for an effective tax rate of 12%, compared to an income tax expense of $2.1 million and effective tax rate of 18% for last year. As previously mentioned, we saw a lower effective tax rate throughout this fiscal year, primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with disqualifying dispositions. Net income increased 5% to $9.8 million compared to $9.3 million for last fiscal year. And diluted earnings per share were $0.47 compared to $0.50 last fiscal year. Adding back the 2.1 million shares of common stock issued in our follow-on offering last August would result in diluted earnings per share increasing to $0.52 this fiscal year compared to last year. EBITDA also increased to $14.5 million, compared to $14.3 million for the same period last fiscal year. We continue to have a strong balance sheet. At the end of the fiscal year, our cash and short-term investments balance was $123.6 million compared to $116 million at the end of last fiscal year. Our strong balance sheet reduces the need to secure additional capital as we continually evaluating strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe can further position us for success in support of long-term revenue targets. We also continue to have no debt on the balance sheet. I'll now turn the call back to you, Shawn. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Will. In conclusion, strategically, we continue to reinforce our leadership in our portion of the biosimulation market for pharmaceuticals as the industry's adoption of model informed drug development tools and techniques continues to expand at a rate four to five times that of overall R&D. We remain well integrated with both academia and regulatory agencies giving a scientific capability as we look to the future. As a result, our Software business is doing very well with accelerated growth rates and expanded capabilities. And our Service business is steadily normalized as evidenced by our improving backlog and strong bookings. This performance gives us confidence that we have clear line of sight to delivering consistent longer-term growth, in line with our growth expectations. With that, I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. You may proceed with your question. Matthew Hewitt -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. And it's nice to see the bounce back in the Services side of the business. Maybe to dig in a little bit there, last quarter as you called out on the last call was abnormal in the number of cancellations, deferrals and whatnot. It seems to bounce back very quickly. What is that -- what are you hearing from your customers? Have any of those contracts that were may be deferred? Have those closed? Any incremental color on the Services side would be helpful. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Sure, Matt. Yeah, it headed back to normalization, and normalization doesn't mean that there are no cancellations or delays or hold has peaked in the third quarter, but down to at a level, which as I said before, is difficult. Three of these occurrences during the quarter is something that we can manage around more depth weight [Phonetic]. And so, good outcome in that regard. Is there any market indicator as to why the frequency step back down? Hard to pinpoint. In the toxicology area, in the QSP area, we are seeing some indication based upon request for proposals and healthy increase in our pipeline. The FDA responses back to companies has picked up, and that's a good sign. So certainly, I can point to that. I would say that it is still a market in terms of our PKPD services where projects come under greater scrutiny I think than in the past. And holds, delays and ultimately, cancellations, as I think I've said before, are a good sign that the fail fast move to the next drug opportunity when this one indicates like [Indecipherable] success profile. I think that's a phenomenon that is a good one. And we're going to have to manage the Service business around on a go-forward basis. But other than that, no flare against from the marketplace. Matthew Hewitt -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst That's great. Shifting to the Software side, a good quarter, better than our estimates anyway. Yet, it sounds like you had five renewals that slipped. Have any of those closed already here in Q4? And is there anything to kind of pick out with those five, or is it just a timing situation? Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer All five closed in the week after the end of the year. Matthew Hewitt -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst That's great. Okay. And then, maybe one last one from me and then, I'll hop back into queue. You mentioned that you are seeing continued market share gains, and I'm just curious if you've seen anything from a competitive response, or is this something that we shouldn't expect as we get into '22 and into '23? Are you going to continue to take share? Thank you. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Our comments there, specifically with regard to Monolix and their growth is certainly well ahead of the growth or NLME applications out there as a whole, overall market growth. So clearly, we're taking some market share of existing players there. Have we seen a response in that regard? Nothing of great significance. The market for Monolix is responding very favorably to its ease of use, the workflow approach. And quite frankly, our clients are attracted to the same benefit that we see internally where we are completing PK to PD projects more efficiently and utilizing less time to get to end of job, when we use Monolix. So very good progress on the Monolix side. And it continues its momentum into next year. Matthew Hewitt -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Francois Brisebois with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question. Francois Brisebois -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst Hi, thanks for the questions. Just quickly here, I was wondering what makes you so confident -- $51 million to $53 million is pretty tight, what gives you confidence to give guidance, due to the fact that it seems like this pandemic is lingering quite a bit? So any factors there. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Well, two sides of our business. On the Software side, with its high recurring revenue, renewal rates gives us the benefit of being pretty confident in terms of the direction of that business, and it's really picked up in the back half of this year. Really over the last couple of three years, we've seen the growth rate -- organic growth rate of our Software business step up and continue to deliver higher growth rates. And so, our Software businesses is performing very well. The COVID impact there even when we look back at the brunt of the COVID impact a couple of years ago, our Software business wasn't unaffected, but was minimally affected. So high degree of confidence on the Software side, still cautious on the Service side. That is where COVID can have its biggest impact with the disruption in terms of clinical trial timing programs being altered and changed and reallocated to other programs in response to things like COVID. And there, we keep a little bit higher discount factor in our heads as we prepare guidance, but the combination of those two gives us high confidence in an environment that Software is performing well. And on the Service side, our underlying pipeline and building a backlog, new contracts being closed is moving quite nicely as we exited the year and begin the year here in fiscal year '22. Francois Brisebois -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst Okay, great. And this has been touched on in the past, but I was just wondering on the M&A front, have you seen valuations come down a little bit and just remind us, has it changed the criteria that you're looking for, is it more geographic, any color there on what you're looking for when you study of M&A? Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I mean our criteria remain unchanged, and the targets that we seek are both software and service. Although software is focus for us. There are some geographical benefits in some locations that would be an attraction to a target, if it was in the right locale to support our expansion on a global basis of our service coverage. But on the valuation side, the financial criteria of our M&A strategy remains unchanged. We are looking for accretive opportunities, and that interplays obviously with valuation quite quickly. Company has got to be performing well and the valuation has to be appropriate, so that it is accretive to us. Have valuations come down? Boy, the discussions are a little bit easier than they were, say, a year ago. It doesn't mean that they're not tough. And I think we still see in the healthcare space and certainly biosimulation space that in addition to market valuation metrics, that might be referred to in valuation discussions. We also see a lot of private companies, private equity funding that comes into play and that affects valuations as well. So, the headline is no valuation discussions are better than they were before. That doesn't mean that they are necessarily easy parts of the discussions that are ongoing in terms of target candidates that we interact with. Francois Brisebois -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst Sounds good. And then, just quickly, quick two questions on the financial side, there was a little jump here on the SG&A side, I guess, 57% of revenues in the fourth quarter. I think you discussed maybe the contract costs went up or maybe, the payroll went up as well and more employees added to the team. Can you just help us understand maybe SG&A going forward? What you expect there? Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, fair enough. A couple of factors in play there. I'll let Will go through the details of the payroll. We did a merger of our three legal entities, essentially SLP, Cognigen and DILIsym from the acquisitions to roll up into one legal entity for multiple purposes that support both our consolidation, integration process internal for the company as well as external cost savings on a number of fronts that will now accrue to us that ultimately had some changes in our payroll systems coming together, but didn't change our payroll cost overall for the year, but lumped it into quarters a little bit non-consistent or non-linearly. The other expenses that came into play in the fourth quarter, all of which if you look and focus on EBITDA, our EBITDA percentage of revenue only declined a couple of points in an environment in which we saw revenues in the back half of the year, well below where we would be -- expected to be. And in terms of our most precious asset, our employees are scientists, not only is it a compensation competitive marketplace that we need to respond to and that provide some pressure and uplift to the costs in that area, but as well, while revenue in the Service business was down, it wasn't a situation in which we are going to shave off our organization to reduce expenses to match that revenue. These are valued assets in this industry. And so, there's some play there as well in terms of opex being a little high in the fourth quarter. Our expectations are on a go-forward basis that nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of our opex, our profitability profile and we expect that fourth quarter percentage of revenue on opex to be a bit of an anomaly and will return to where we've been the last year or two in opex on a go-forward basis. Francois Brisebois -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst Great. That's it from me. Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Take care, Frank. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question. Dane Leone -- Raymond James -- Analyst HI, thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. So just lot of questions here, but can you -- do you have an idea of how active you think you're going to be in terms of acquisitions at the coming year? I think we get that question a lot of how you can get a bit more aggressive. So is your messaging today that valuation, do you feel are still prohibited from engaging in M&A, or you expect some deals to get done over the next 12 months. And I have a follow-up. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Sure, Dane. Yeah, obviously, we can't pinpoint and target a predictive date in terms of acquisition, but I think now versus a year ago, the number of discussions that are active, the nature of those discussions being a little less cloudy because of valuation. Certainly, it gives me a pretty optimistic view that an acquisition can be achieved in the coming time frame. Now, can that -- does that mean in three months, four months, eight months, nine months in the next year? We certainly are motivated to find the right target, close a deal that meets our criteria and add it to the portfolio of Simulations Plus companies as quick as we can. That said, it's a market and a process that can't be predicted with exact clockwork. So confident that we will continue to invest the resources necessary to identify and pursue appropriate targets out there, confident that they exist and that at some point in time, we'll have an announcement in this regard to bring to you. Dane Leone -- Raymond James -- Analyst Okay. Any specific size of deal that you think is going to make more or less signs maybe in terms of like the target revenue generation? Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer There is a range of the targets that we're in discussions with right now. Lixoft, I'll just use as a leverage point in response here. We're $3 million or close to $4 million in revenue, Those sort of targets or that level size of target is probably plentiful in our discussions today. That being said that there are some targets that would be of the higher size in math, higher revenue levels in that. On the Service side, most of those organizations are at the Lixoft or below size in terms of their revenue field flows. On the Service side, they tend to be a little bit smaller groups of consultants. That would be targets. So yeah, I'd use Lixoft as a good example in terms of size and maybe, there's some opportunities that are a little bit larger and Lixoft out there. Francois Brisebois -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst Okay, great. And last one for me, can just clarify in terms of response in the operating margin this quarter and I guess, abnormal SG&A spend? Is that -- are you clarifying that that's a one-time increase or one abnormality I guess for whatever you're doing with the consolidating those businesses, or is there a new higher run rate that we have to expect for SG&A? Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think for the most part, it's a blip in the quarter. Obviously, our growth of nine people, we're continuing compensation response to the marketplace. There are some expenses that are going up, but certainly that which is attributable to the payroll adjustment, I think, will reference to number of about $700,000 in the quarter that expense -- that amount is not recurring in nature. Dane Leone -- Raymond James -- Analyst Okay. Will Frederick -- Chief Financial Officer I'd add on there. I'm happy to add on that. It's for Q4, timing is what I would focus on it. And for the year, it's where we came out in the revenue growth with services' challenges. To go back and look at say, first half of the year, we were at about 21% growth rate. From an absolute dollar standpoint, our operating expenses will continue to go up, just driven by higher revenue as well as bringing more people on controlled pace, but keeping competitive in salaries, but if we ended up where we had looked at the beginning of the year, I think our total R&D would still be in the 7% to 8% range, which is about where we were last fiscal year. In our SG&A in that 41% to 42% range, when you look at things as a percentage of revenues, still trying to keep operating expenses in total, below that 50% sort of number, but timing was the Q4 with expenses coming on this quarter versus other quarters. Dane Leone -- Raymond James -- Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Will Frederick -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Operator [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Shawn O'Connor for closing comments. Shawn O'Connor -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, good. Well, thank you everyone. We are pleased that we saw some uptick in terms of where we came in the fourth quarter compared to a challenging third quarter and are very pleased with the momentum on both sides of our business, both the Software and Service businesses as they enter our new fiscal year. Look forward to reporting further results a quarter from now to you. Take care. Thanks a lot.

Now I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Madeleine. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to provide a high-level overview of our third quarter financial results and the associated performance drivers. I'll then wrap up by summarizing our key growth initiatives. Brian will then walk you through our financials and full-year 2021 business outlook in greater detail. Our third quarter net sales of $396.7 million were once again very strong and increased 8.9% over the prior-year period. Sales growth was primarily driven by product price increases to offset rising raw material costs. While the macroeconomic landscape remained challenged throughout the third quarter due to ongoing global supply chain constraints, limited steel availability and a tight labor market, we continued to deliver on the key elements of our business model to ensure our customers' needs were met. This includes but is not limited to ensuring availability of our trusted product solutions typically within 48 hours or less. To date, we have implemented four price increases in 2021; in early April, mid-June, mid-August, and our fourth price increase in mid-October. These price increases ranged from mid-single digits to mid-teens depending on the product mix for certain of our wood connector, fasteners and concrete products in the United States. Looking at our sales results in greater detail, although third quarter net sales benefited primarily from a full quarter of the first two price increases, our top line moderately declined by 3.3% compared to the second quarter of 2021, predominantly due to decreases in sales volumes from our home center channel, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. These price increases were primary contributors to another quarter of strong gross margins, which increased to 49.9% from 47.9% in the prior quarter and 47.6% in the year-ago period. As a result, our income from operations improved to $100.6 million and led to strong earnings per diluted share of $1.70. As we highlighted on our last call, we currently anticipate significant gross margin compression beginning in fiscal 2022 as we continue to acquire higher priced raw materials, thereby raising our average cost of steel on hand. Brian will discuss this impact in more detail during his remarks. Turning back to our sales performance. We experienced decline in sales volume during the third quarter throughout the various forms of distribution channels we serve, including our home center channel and other distribution channels to contractors and lumberyards. As a reminder, the home center channel includes both our home center and co-op customers, and is where we see much of our repair and remodel and DIY business. We experienced a slowdown in this channel during the third quarter as we believe there may be a releveling of inventory for our customers. Additionally, our sales reflected an as expected decline year-over-year related to the return of Lowe's as a home center customer. As you may recall, we experienced elevated volume in both Q2 and Q3 of 2020 as we've loaded in our products at the Lowe's locations, resulting in a difficult comp in both quarter two and quarter three of this year. We expect volume levels in the home center channel to become normalizing in the fourth quarter as demand increases and we pass the elevated volumes from last year's product rolling into Lowe's. Similar to the home center channel, we experienced modest volume decline in our other distribution channels to contractors and lumberyards during the quarter. We are confident this decline in volume is not due to a loss of customer or market share and attribute this primarily to customers adopting a more cautious stance in regard to their inventory levels given tightening labor and supply chain conditions and the potential impact on the building industry. With that said, U.S. housing starts continue to show promise, improving by 19.5% during the first nine months of 2021 versus comparable period last year. And finally in Europe, our third quarter sales improved over the prior year on a local currency basis, primarily from strengthening demand compared to the prior year where we experienced government-mandated COVID-19-related closures and to a lesser extent from price increases. Sales in Europe also improved from our ability to continue meeting our customers' needs due to our solid inventory management practices amid broader supply chain shortage. I'll now turn to a high-level discussion on our key growth initiatives, which we first unveiled in late March of this year. We are focused on growing in the OEM, repair/remodel, DIY and mass timber markets, where we are striving to be a leader in engineered low-graded construction fastening solutions, given that each of these markets have a broader product opportunity within the fastening solutions. We are also focused on building our presence in concrete construction as well as structural steel, which is a new market for Simpson. While we are looking to grow our presence in each of these key growth areas, it's important to realize that we already have existing products, testing results, distribution and manufacturing capacities in place for all five of these initiatives. To bolster our growth, we remain focused on organic opportunities through expansion into new markets within our core competencies of wood and concrete products, as well as inorganic opportunities through licensing, purchasing IP and traditional M&A. While we are pleased that we are continuing to build out these product lines and inherit new customer wins to improve our market share, we recognize this will be a multi-year endeavor to ensure we have the proper testing, the validation of our product lines, and to ensure we provide our customers with the highest-quality solution sets to build safer, stronger structures. Currently, each of our key growth initiatives remains in different phases of implementation. However, we believe that these are the right areas to pursue to position Simpson for above-market growth based on our ability to execute given the core tenants of our business model. That includes our strong long-standing relationship with top builders, engineers, contractors, code officials and distributors, as well as our significant engineering expertise and our ongoing commitment to testing, research and innovation. Finally, we are working to become a leader in building technology space, which hits upon all of our key growth initiatives. As we continue to develop innovative new tools and solutions for our customers to help with design and options management, we'll also be able to easily specify the right Simpson solution for the job, helping to drive enhanced growth across our business. Our strong earnings and effective working capital management have enabled us to continue generating strong cash flow to fuel our growth and stockholder return priorities. In regard to growth, we are dual focused on both organic growth and M&A opportunities, facilitate growth organically, we are investing in areas such as engineering, marketing and sales personnel, as well as testing capabilities across all areas of our business, including the aforementioned five adjacencies where we are looking to expand. We may also invest in facility expansions to support our growth. In regards to M&A, we are more broadly focused on product line expansions in order to develop complete solutions for the markets in which we operate. This may also include opportunities in areas that support our key growth initiatives. In summary, despite broader market challenges, we are very pleased with our continued strong results, both financially and operational for the third quarter. I want to say thank you to all our Simpson Strong-Tie employees for your commitment to health, safety and outstanding customer service to successfully manage through the broader supply chain constraints and keep our customers up and running. Thank you for your time and attention. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian, who will discuss our third quarter financial results and our 2021 outlook in greater detail. Brian? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Karen, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to discuss our third quarter financial results with you today. Before I begin, I'd like to mention that unless otherwise stated, all financial measures discussed in my prepared remarks today refer to the third quarter of 2021, and all comparisons will be year-over-year comparisons versus the third quarter of 2020. Now turning to our results. As Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales increased 8.9% to $396.7 million. Within the North America segment, net sales increased 6.8% to $338.6 million, primarily due to product price increases that took effect through the third quarter of 2021 in an effort to address rising material costs and were partially offset by a decline in sales volumes, primarily in our home center channel. In Europe, net sales increased 22.5% to $54.8 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes compared to last year's COVID-19-related slowdown. Europe sales also benefited by approximately $900,000 of positive foreign currency translations, resulting from some Europe currencies strengthening against the United States dollar. Wood construction products remained consistent at 85% of total sales and concrete construction products also remained consistent at 15% of total sales. Consolidated gross profit increased by 14.3% to $198 million, which resulted in another strong gross margin quarter at 49.9%. Gross margin increased by 230 basis points, primarily due to the aforementioned price increases, which were partially offset by higher material costs. On a segment basis, our gross margin in North America increased to 52.1% compared to 48.9%, while in Europe our gross margin declined slightly to 37.7% compared to 37.9%. From a product perspective, our third quarter gross margin on wood products was 50.2% compared to 48% in the prior-year quarter, and was 44.6% for concrete products compared to 42.1% in the prior-year quarter. Now turning to our third quarter costs and operating expenses. As a reminder, last year, we implemented various cost-saving and other measures in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, total operating expenses were $97.4 million, an increase of $15.4 million or approximately 18.8%. As a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses were 24.6% compared to 22.5. Research and development and engineering expenses increased 18.5% to $14.6 million, primarily due to increased salaries and expenses on patents. Selling expenses increased 19.3% to $35.1 million due to increased salaries, commissions and travel expenses. On a segment basis, selling expenses in North America were up 18.9% and in Europe they were up 22.4%. General and administrative expenses increased 18.6% to $47.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries, a variable compensation and travel expenses. Our solid top-line performance, combined with our stronger Q3 gross margin, helped drive a 10.2% increase in consolidated income from operations to $100.6 million compared to $91.3 million. In North America, income from operations increased 11% to $97 million, primarily due to the increase in gross profit, partly offset by higher operating expenses. In Europe, income from operations increased 23.8% to $7.5 million, primarily due to the increase in sales volumes and gross profit. On a consolidated basis, our operating income margin of 25.4% increased by approximately 30 basis points from 25.1%. Our effective tax rate decreased slightly to 26.1% from 26.2%. Accordingly, net income totaled $73.8 million or $1.70 per fully diluted share, compared to $67.1 million or $1.54 per fully diluted share. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remained healthy with ample liquidity to operate our day-to-day operations. At September 30th, cash and cash equivalents totaled $294.2 million, a decrease of $17.3 million compared to September 30, 2020. And as of September 30, 2021, the full $300 million on our primary credit line was available for borrowing and we remained debt free. Our inventory position of $385.5 million at September 30th increased by $75.3 million from our balance at June 30th, primarily due to the increases we saw in steel prices over the first nine months of the year. We continue to be highly selective in regard to inventory purchases through careful management and purchasing practices, while at the same time ensuring we maintain ample product availability in order to provide our customers continued high levels of customer service and on-time delivery standards, which are key cornerstones to our value proposition. As a result of our improved profitability and effective working capital management, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $40.5 million for the third quarter of 2021. Turning to capital allocation. We remain dedicated to supporting the growth of our business as well as providing strong capital returns to our stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $12 million for capital expenditures during the quarter as well as pay $10.9 million in dividends and repurchase 222,060 shares of our common stock at an average price of $108.64 per share for a total of $24.1 million. On October 19, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. The dividend will be payable on January 27, 2022 to stockholders of record as of January 6, 2022. And as of September 30, 2021, we had $75.9 million of our share repurchase authorization available, which remains in effect through the end of 2021. Given our confidence in our business and our expectation that our strategic initiatives will continue to drive improved operational performance and a higher return on invested capital, we expect we will remain both active and opportunistic as it relates to share repurchase activity. Finally, I'd like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook. Based on business trends and conditions as of today, October 25th, we are updating certain elements of our guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2021 as follows. We are updating our operating margin outlook to be in the range of 20% to 22% from our previous estimate of 19.5% to 21%. Our current outlook reflects three quarters of actual results as well as our latest expectations regarding demand trends, raw material input costs, and operating expenses. We are reiterating the remaining elements of our outlook for fiscal 2021 as follows. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%, including both federal and state income tax rates. And our capital expenditures outlook remains in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including approximately $15 million to $20 million that will be used for safety and maintenance capex. At this time, only a small amount of our capex spend is related to implementing our key growth initiatives. Further, I'd like to provide some additional color on our margin expectations for fiscal 2022. Based on our current expectations, we are anticipating continued raw material cost pressure for the remainder of 2021 and into fiscal 2022. Our gross margins thus far in 2021 reflect an average cost of steel sourced prior to and during the increasing steel price market. As we work through our on-hand inventory and continue to buy raw material at these much higher prices, our anticipated cost of goods sold are expected to increase significantly in late 2021 and into 2022, even if prices for raw material begin to decline, which will adversely affect our margins as the impacts from averaging raw material costs typically lags our price increases. As a result and based on our updated fiscal 2021 operating margin outlook, we currently expect our operating margin for the full year of 2022 will decline by approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points year-over-year. However, despite near-term macroeconomic pressures, we continue to believe we can maintain an industry-leading operating margin in the high-teens range annually in the long term, a key goal of our five-year Company ambitions. In summary, we were pleased with our strong third quarter financial results and remain focused on executing against our strategic, operational and financial initiatives. We believe our industry-leading position, geographic reach and diverse product offerings, combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, gives us confidence in our ability to maintain operational excellence to support current and future demand trends. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Karen for some closing remarks. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian. Again, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial and operational results that we've achieved despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. While we cannot control elements of the economy, we are dedicated to managing the key areas of our business that we can control, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our five-year Company ambitions. These include strengthening our values-based culture, being the partner of choice in all aspects of our business, being an innovative leader in our product categories, to continue our above-market growth relative to U.S. housing starts, and maintaining an operating income margin and return on invested capital target within the top quartile of our proxy peers. I want to thank you again and thank all our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders for your continued support of Simpson Strong-Tie. With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator? Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Hey, everybody. Good afternoon. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Tim. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hey, Tim. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Maybe just to start if -- in North America, if you can maybe throw up a couple of numbers for me. I guess the first piece is, what was the contribution from pricing in the quarter? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer That was -- give me just a second here. About $75 million, Tim. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Okay. And is that -- if you kind of look at the four price increases that you've implemented, what would you -- what would you think run rate kind of pricing should be on a quarterly basis once everything is fully effective? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Good question because the third price increase that took effect was halfway through the quarter and of course we've got the fourth one that's just very recently took effect. I'd say about $100 million all in. Now of course, that is comparing it to prior to any price increase. So as we start lapping quarters here, we're going to start lapping quarters with price increases in them, but $100 million all-in versus no price increase. Does that makes sense? Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you. And then -- go ahead. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer No, that's it. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst And then on the -- and then I guess on the home center business, is there a way to kind of indicate how much that business was down in dollars? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer So we had a pretty -- there was a -- from a comparability perspective, it was down a pretty good amount. Part of it was due to the load in last year as noted, but also part of it was due to -- we believe they were -- the home center customers were doing some inventory leveling during early -- like July August of the quarter because they had -- have had pretty good inventory position leading up through the end of Q2. So I don't have a dollar amount that we're going to share with you, but a big portion of that was -- of the volume decline in the quarter was related to the home center channel. Again, tough comparable because last year heavy DIY projects in addition to the load-in, but also the inventory leveling we believe was taking place. For the end of the quarter, we feel that more normal buying patterns are in existence, probably through -- in September. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect more of the normal patterns of purchases through the home centers. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Okay. And what about kind of -- I guess if you look at like October, did you -- if you kind of look at your volume numbers, you could look at it total or by home center and by kind of legacy distribution. But did October see improvements? Because it sounds like the core distribution channel was down a little bit in the third quarter. Has that started to kind of grow again as you've gotten into the fourth quarter? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Tim. We're seeing some nice growth in early -- obviously we're early in the fourth quarter. But as Brian mentioned, we saw the home center business kind of pick up a little bit to become more normal buying in September continuing through October. And as we also mentioned, our other means of distribution, really contractor distributors, lumberyards, they were also pretty slow in the first couple of months of Q3. We're seeing that pick up again also. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Got you. Okay. Okay. And then just the last question I had on lead times. Where are your lead times today in terms of when customers order and how quickly you're able to fulfill those orders? And how has it changed over the last six months to nine months? Has there been a lot of ups and downs or you've been pretty consistent on lead times? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. As you know, we think our availability of product and lead time is a very large differentiator for us. So we're still north of 97% on lead times on the majority of a product that a customer would order. It doesn't mean that if there was a special or something that it might take a little bit longer, but we're still running a little north of 97% in that 24-hour to 48-hour lead time. And that's a big differentiator for us. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Yeah. So basically, you would -- would you agree with the statement that your customers don't necessarily feel the need to over order or stock in the sense that they know your lead times are pretty good and so they're not -- a lot of their orders are actually reflective of end-market demand versus any sort of inventory build? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I mean, we've done a really good job. Probably ever since in 2008 downturn, I would say, that being able to -- I would say, our customers feel comfortable that they don't need a lot of product in their inventory because we can fill their orders in an expedited manner. So we haven't really seen that change like we're not seeing a lot of customers add extra inventory, and again I think that's just a credit to what we've been able to do with our lean manufacturing and being able to meet those customer needs and fill those orders in that 48-hour timeframe at that 97%, 98% rate. Timothy Wojs -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst Okay. Okay, good. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. Thank you for the time. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. Thanks, Tim. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thanks, Tim. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. You may proceed with your question. Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst Afternoon, Karen and Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Dan. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hi, Dan. Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst Just wondering, obviously, we're in our fourth round of price increases. Are you seeing -- it doesn't sound like it, given the pickup in demand in October -- September-October. But are you seeing any signs at all of your customers' customers' demand being impacted after multiple rounds of pretty significant price increases over the last six months to 12 months? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think, Dan, it's those price increases we're seeing and all construction materials and of course we focus on anything associated with steel. So as they see price increases with anything really associated, I always refer to garage doors and appliances, obviously our products. And what's really been the huge driver for us, has been the availability of product. We mentioned -- we think we've heard from our customers that we've been one of their best suppliers in this really tight market from a supply chain standpoint. We've heard from some of our competitors' customers that they're having -- they'd like to get some product from us. So I think we've gained just a little bit of market share, especially in our European market, by being able to meet those needs and have that inventory. But it's really been a supply issue rather than focus so much on pricing. Not to say from our sales standpoint that it's easy to get a price increase through, always a difficult thing, but it's so highly publicized in the market space that our customers understand why we're having to have these price increases. Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst Helpful. And I think you mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but your increased inventory levels. How much does that reflect just pricing versus quantity? And at this stage, do you feel pretty comfortable about your ability to procure so you don't need to strategically continue to build inventories in terms of actual volumes? Any commentary there? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hey, Dan. Significant -- the majority of the increase is price related on the inventory. And... Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would say from the steel, again, we've -- our purchasing group has done an excellent job of making sure that we've got steel to be able to meet our customer needs. But as you pointed out, it's a balancing act right now ensuring that we have steel that we can continue those fill rates, but then not having too much steel if we have any pricing decrease that we see. Right now, we still see the steel industry is -- I would say it's -- maybe it's slowed a little bit, it hasn't come down, but price increasing has slowed a little bit. So we will just see how that continues. I think most people, most people, most industries would think that there is some new volume for steel mills coming online. It was supposed to come online in fourth quarter. Now it's anticipated late first quarter. I think that will help, and we'll see how things go from there. But we are very cautiously trying to balance customer needs, we ensure we have that product for them as well as steel inventories. Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst Perfect. Maybe just one more kind of high level. Just as you look around the country, are you seeing any changes in building code standards in any particular areas that could potentially impact your revenue or competitive positioning over the coming years? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer We actually -- and I think this is kind of early on, but this build-to-rent concept, we have had some of those owners of those buildings contact us about building to a resiliency standard versus a life safety standard. Resiliency meaning that they're going to hold on to that building for quite a long time as they continue to rent it, and so they want the building to be able to be occupied after any sort of natural disaster. So it's just starting, but that's quite interesting for us because it means typically you would put more of our content into a house built from a resiliency standpoint versus a house built from a life safety standpoint, and just on the tip of the iceberg of seeing what happens with this. Daniel Moore -- CJS Securities -- Analyst All right. Look forward to seeing it. I appreciate the color once again. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Dan. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. You may proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, Karen and Brian. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Kurt. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hello, Kurt. Kurt Yinger -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Hi. Just starting off, when we think about the increase in the operating margin outlook kind of back to the prior range after the strong Q3, just curious what were the biggest upside surprises in terms of the performance in the quarter relative to your expectations because it sounds at least like volume was pretty challenging and you haven't yet benefited from the fourth price increase. So just curious what was better than expected there? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. Part of it is the price increase relative to the use of the associated inventory, the timing of that. And then the -- I think we may have saw a little bit more strength in European margin and then also the trajectory of expenses through the balance of the year, what projects would start and continue through the balance of the year. So, at the six-month mark, we were making some estimates, obviously with an additional three months under our belt and just only three months left in the year give us a little bit more of that insight into bringing that operating margin back up at the high end there -- low end and high end. Kurt Yinger -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Got it. Okay. And then, historically, Simpson has had a premium price position relative to peers and it would seem that the value proposition is there currently, perhaps even more so than it's been in the past. Is where you're pricing today, is that consistent with where you've been historically? And how does kind of competitive positioning factor into your decision-making process around price at a time when inputs are rising so meaningfully? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think, Kurt, you mentioned a key point to us. From the standpoint of the services that we provide for our product as we talked about this on-time delivery, we talked about large SKU mix, our customer service both inside and our outside sales team as well as our engineering that we really pride ourselves. Again, as we talked about, we don't want to sell on price, we want to sell on all the services and that's really where you see that pricing premium. I would say, today, we still probably have that pricing differential in place. And as I mentioned, what's key to our customers is availability of the product. We never want to be the vendor that shuts a job site down because we didn't have product available for those customers. And I think it's been really well appreciated as we're in times of the tight supply chain. Kurt Yinger -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Right. Right. Makes sense. Okay. And then just last one from me. I didn't hear it in the prepared remarks, but I'm just curious whether sourcing from overseas has been a challenge for you guys. At least in the last few years, I think North America fasteners' production capabilities have been something that's been of interest. Given everything that's going on, is that still a priority and is that something where you would look to M&A or something you could maybe build out organically? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, it's a great question. As we've mentioned, our fastener business is one of our fastest growing, has been for probably the last three years to four years. We domestically manufacture at a Simpson facility about 35% of our fasteners, and we buy the other 65% offshore basically in Taiwan. A typical lead time before this year would have been maybe three months to six months to get a product. We are now running about 10 months to 14 months lead time on those products out of Taiwan, and that certainly makes it very difficult when we think about forecasting and also having that inventory on hand. So as we've talked about in the past, we're very interested in trying to grow through either acquisition or organically, more control of our capabilities of manufacturing that product and a little less dependent on buying out of that products. So certainly it's on our radar and something that we're constantly looking for. Kurt Yinger -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst And do you have, I guess, extra space at the existing facility? Or would that be something where, if you were to do it organically, it would need to be kind of a greenfield location? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Well, a lot of that, Kurt, has additional manufacturing that -- the local manufacturing that Karen had mentioned, we have stood that up over the last number of years within an existing factory here locally in the U.S. As we move things around and utilize space, we've been able to bring that production in-house. A lot of things that we also do from a lean perspective, try to take advantage of that to the best that we can. But we're getting to the point -- to the point where it may hit an inflection and we may need to add some facility footprint into that -- into those locations that we're doing that in. So you've always heard us talk about we like local production to be able to respond quick to customer needs, and this has been the buildup of that. But we will -- if we continue to significantly grow the amount of local production, we would need to make some investments in facility. Kurt Yinger -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst Got it. Okay. Well, appreciate all the color and good luck here in Q4, guys. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Kurt. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thanks, Kurt. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. You may proceed with your question. Julio Romero -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst Hey, good afternoon, Karen and Brian. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Julio. How are you? Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Hello, Julio. Julio Romero -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst I'm good, thanks. So I wanted to dig a little more into the channels in North America other than the home centers. I think you mentioned the volume headwinds in contractors and lumberyards. There may have been some different drivers that drove the decline on those channels than what happened in the home centers. I believe you mentioned more of a cautious stance because of their own labor and supply constraints. So I was hoping you could speak a little more to that and if you've seen -- and have those labor and supply issues alleviated in those channels at all? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, it's a great question. And we certainly saw and heard from some of our customers kind of a slowdown on that new construction standpoint just because, one, pricing of lumber, which is now gone down, but pricing of lumber was very high, unable to complete structures because of supply chain issues again whether that be doors or windows, appliances, faucets, sinks, it didn't really matter but unable to complete the structure. And so we definitely saw that slowdown in that space. We have now seen as we came out of the third quarter in September and as we're looking at fourth quarter with where we are so far in early October an uptick in those markets just as we've seen an uptick in that home center buy also. Julio Romero -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst Great. And would you say that the uptick is to the same extent that you've seen in home centers, either I guess on a percentage basis or however you want to take that? Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean I think as we know the cyclicality of our market, it's pretty well-defined and also when you think from the home center standpoint. So I would say we're seeing what I would call a normalized, if there is such a thing, a normalized uptick in both what we see from our contractor distributor, lumberyards as well as the home centers. So nothing -- no unusual anomalies at least in the last 60 days or so. Brian Magstadt -- Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer And that's a Q[Phonetic] relative to the prior-year same period. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Right, relative to Q4. Julio Romero -- Sidoti & Co. -- Analyst Yeah, absolutely. Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions and best of luck in the fourth quarter. Karen Colonias -- President and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thanks, Julio.

In the third quarter of 2021, our gross loans, excluding PPP loans, increased by $255.6 million to $15.8 billion, which represents an annualized growth rate of 9.1%. The increase in loans for the third quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by increases of $73.8 million or 11.2% annualized in commercial loans, excluding PPP loans, $220.4 million or 11.6% annualized in commercial real estate loans, $23.7 million or 14.3% annualized in real estate construction loans and $41.1 million or 4% annualized in residential mortgage loans. Our fourth quarter loan growth continues to be strong and will likely exceed that of the third quarter. The overall loan growth for 2021 is expected to be close to 5%. During the third quarter of 2021, $73.9 million of PPP loans were forgiven. As of September 30, 2021, our deferred PPP loan fees were $3.8 million. We continue to monitor our commercial real estate loans. Turning to Slide 7 of our earnings presentation, as of September 30, 2021, the average loan to value of our CRE loans was 51%. As of September 30, 2021, our retail property loan portfolio comprises 22% of our total commercial real estate loan portfolio and 11% of our total loan portfolio. The majority, 62% of the $1.74 billion in retail loans is secured by neighborhood mixed use or strip centers and only 9% secured by shopping centers. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported net charge-offs of $2.3 million compared to net charge-off of $7.3 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our third quarter charge-offs included a commercial loan charge-off of $1.3 million from our Hong Kong office. Our non-accrual loans were 0.43% of total loans as of September 30, 2021, increased slightly by $0.9 million to $68.7 million as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2021. We recorded a provision for credit loss of $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to a $9 million reversal of provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2021. The provision for credit losses of $3.1 million reflected net charge-offs of $2.3 million in provisions for the loan growth during the third quarter. We expect the provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter as a result of the expected loan growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 12. Total average deposits increased by $517.2 million or 12.6% annualized during the third quarter of 2021. We were especially pleased by the $233 million increase or 25.6% annualized in average demand deposits during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Average time deposit decreased by $152.6 million or 10.1% annualized due mainly to the run-off of broker CDs. We repurchased 942,613 shares of our stock at an average cost of $39.40, totaling $37.1 million in the third quarter of 2021. There is $98.6 million remaining under our September 2021 $125 million stock buyback program. We continue to work on the integration and conversion plan for our purchase of the 10 branches in select West Coast loans and deposits from HSBC. This transaction will broaden the reach of our Northern and Southern California branch network, in addition to acquiring $1 billion in low-cost deposits and $800 million in residential mortgages. The transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2022. I will now turn the floor over to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Heng Chen, to discuss the third quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Chang. And good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of 2021, net income decreased by $4.8 million or 6.2% to $72.4 million compared to second quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to a provision for credit losses of $3 million in the third quarter as compared to $9 million reversal of provision for credit losses in the second quarter. Our net interest margin was 3.22% in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 3.24% in the second quarter of 2021. In the third quarter of 2021, interest recoveries and prepayment penalties added 4 basis points to the net interest margin as compared to 3 basis points for the second quarter of 2021. There were $3.1 billion of loans at the floor rate as of September 30, 2021, approximately $1.4 billion of our CDs mature during the fourth quarter 2021, with a average rate of 0.68%. We are targeting renewing retail CDs in the 40 to 50 basis point range. Given the results of the third quarter of 2021, we continue to expect our net interest margin for 2021 to be between 3.2% to 3.3%. Non-interest income during the third quarter of 2021 decreased by $360,000 to $12.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a one-time BOLI income of $1.2 million in the second quarter. Non-interest expense increased by $2.5 million or 3.6% to $72.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 when compared to $69.7 million in the second quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in amortization in low-income housing and solar tax credit funds. Including a $3.2 million catch-up adjustment, for 2020, low-income housing losses [Phonetic] resulting from the receipt of 2020 Tier 1s and an increase of $0.7 million in salary and employee benefits, mainly from higher bonus accruals. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 19.1% as compared to 22.7% for the second quarter of 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a $1.7 million catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2021 for 2020 solar tax credits. For higher 2020 solar tax credits resulting from the receipt of 2020 tail wins, we expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be between 21.5% and 22%. Solar tax credit amortization was $1.4 million in third quarter of 2021 and is expected to be $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of September 30, 2021, our Tier 1 leverage capital ratio decreased to 10.67% as compared to 10.35% as of June 30, 2021, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio decreased to 13.29% from 13.77% as of September 30, 2021 and our total risk-based capital ratio decreased to 14.93% from 15.47% as of June 30, 2021. Georgia Lo -- Assistant Secretary and Investor Relations Thank you, Heng. We will now proceed to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Brandon King from Truist Securities. Brandon, your line is open. Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Hey. Good afternoon. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Brandon. Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Hey. So, loan growth was pretty strong in the quarter, kind of ahead of guidance of 3% to 5%. How do you think that will shake out going into 2022? When do you think you're kind of on a sustainable trajectory when it comes on loan growth, especially on the commercial side? Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer So far, we're looking at fourth quarter pipelines and fourth quarter pipelines are pretty strong. So, I think, we're kind of staying on our sort of the target growth range in the 5% range for 2021. As far as 2022, I think it really comes down to -- a lot has to do with sort of the economic recovery, some of the shipping and freight delay costs and what's going on at the ports. I think our commercial growth -- C&I growth on the third quarter was pretty strong at $73 million range. We're -- in talking to some of our clients, we believe that 2022 will hopefully show a strong growth as well. But not completely certain where some of that growth will come from and in which segment, whether that's C&I side or the commercial real estate side. Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. Well, Brandon, we'll give formal guidance in January when we report the fourth quarter earnings. But I want to also add that, we think in 2022, the residential mortgage loan portfolio will start to increase faster because with higher interest rates we think the prepayments on that portfolio will be much lower, so it will have a higher growth rate in 2022. But once again, we'll update in January. Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the liabilities side, with deposit repricing, could you tell us or give us an update on running off those broker deposits and what do you expect from the ceding pricing picture in 4Q and potentially early 1Q '22? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. We have probably $200 million of wholesale deposits that we will be running off in the fourth quarter. Of that, $100 million will be fairly [Phonetic] late -- it will be in late December, so we won't see the full quarter effect. And in Q1 2022, we'll probably have another $150 million of brokerage CD run-off. But as we get into 2022, if our loan growth resumes to be stronger than it has been in 2021, we may even start to have to renew some brokered CDs. And then, lastly, as interest rates are increasing, we are buying more securities, given that the yields are more attractive. So, I know those are some of the background on how we're thinking there. Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Okay. And for those broker deposits, if you do renew those, what would be the delta in the cost based on what they are today and what you will renew? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer I'm telling you this from memory. I think that probably about 50 basis points and then we have a brokered money market deposit that's only 1 basis point. I talked about that in the past. So that's going to mature in December. Brandon King -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Okay. Thanks for answering all my questions. Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah, thank you. Operator For our next question, we have David Chiaverini from Wedbush Securities. David, your line is open. David Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is on deposit growth. How are you guys thinking about deposit flows here? It's been pretty decent. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer For us, we're seeing accumulation of deposit balances from our customers. We're also kind of making a shift away from CDs and focusing more on business operating accounts as much as we can. Some of that CD balances may have transitioned over to money market balances as we've seen that in our quarter-over-quarter results. But for the most part, we're driving toward lower cost of deposits and lower cost of funds. David Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst Great. Thanks for that. And you mentioned about roughly $100 million remaining on your buyback authorization. I was curious about your appetite for additional purchases from here? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer I think we'll still be in the market. Compared to our peers, our price to tangible book is somewhat lower and our capital levels are pretty strong. So, we'll -- we won't be in the market. But at some point, we may taper back on that depending on the stock price. David Chiaverini -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst Yes, that makes sense. Thanks very much. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thank you. Operator For our next question, we have Chris McGratty from KBW. Chris, your line is open. Chris McGratty -- KBW -- Analyst Hey, good afternoon. Heng, I was wondering if you could repeat the numbers for the branches. I think you said $1 billion of deposits, $850 million of loans, I'm wondering associated expenses from that transaction and also just kind of help with the expense guide on your transaction? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Chris, I think, this -- we said it, the HSBC deals got 2% accretive. In terms of expenses, it's roughly slightly over $10 million and the revenues are the low $20 million, but we're waiting to get, all of this information is as of March 2021, and we're waiting for HSBC to give us updated balances. And then when we announced in January, we'll probably -- we'll update that. Chris McGratty -- KBW -- Analyst Okay. So those are annual numbers, the $10 million and $20 million, OK. Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. And then, for your modelling, there is going to be one-time expenses, maybe in $3.8 million [Phonetic]. I don't know how finally you do there, as probably $2 million to $3 million. And then we have the day one CECL charge for those acquired loans, you might want to use 50 basis points on quite loan balance it is. Ultimately, we still think it's going to be 2% accretive. Chris McGratty -- KBW -- Analyst Okay. That's great. And then, maybe if I could, my follow-up. The little bit of tax on the solar and low-income, I think, you said $1.5 million for the solar. What was the low-income that we should be modeling for next quarter? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Probably $7 million. Yeah, in Q3 we had this catch-up adjustment, as I mentioned, of $3.2 million, but in Q4, it's going to be $7 million. Chris McGratty -- KBW -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] For our next question, we have Gerry Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Jerry, your line is open. Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to actually clarify on the catch-up adjustment. You said it was $3.2 million or, I thought I heard $2.2 million? And then what was the associated tax impact on that catch-up adjustment? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Can you repeat the question, Jerry? Are you talking about the low-income housing? Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Yeah. The catch-up adjustment on the amortization. I had written down $2.2 million, was it $3.2 million or $2.2 million? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer It was $3.2 million on the low-income housing. Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Okay. And then, the associated tax impact because of the catch-up? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer There was none. Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst There was none? Okay. Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer And we have a $1.6 million tax benefit from the solar catch-up. Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Okay. Okay, great. And then, just follow-up, in terms of the core loan yields, by my math, down about 12 basis points to 4% or 4.01%, simply just the kind of pull-down effect of new production yields being below portfolio yields. I think you'd highlighted the prepayment benefit, which is really unchanged versus last quarter? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. We --you want to cover that? Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer You're asking about the origination yields versus the portfolio yields? Heng W. Chen -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Yeah. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer Gerry? Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Yeah, effectively. Yes. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, for the residential mortgage originations, third quarter, we're probably around 3.82% compared to the weighted average portfolio of about 4.03%. On the commercial real estate Q3 origination, we're at about 3.57% compared to the weighted average portfolio at about 4.23%. And on the new C&I loans, our current originations are close to 5% versus the weighted Q3 portfolio you had about 3.61%. Gerry Tenner -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer Of course. Operator At this time, there are no questions in the queue. Thank you for your participation. I will now turn back the call over to Cathay General Bancorp's management for closing remarks. Chang M. Liu -- President and Chief Executive Officer I want to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you at our next quarterly earnings release call.

I am Blu, today's conference call operator. Welcome to the Heidrick and Struggles 2021 Third Quarter Conference call. Joining today's call is Company's President and CEO, Krishnan Rajagopalan and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Harris. The company has posted third quarter slides on the IR homepage of its website at heidrick.com. Management encourage you see to view the slides for additional context. Please note that in the materials presented today, management may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide additional insight into underlying results. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures may be found in the last schedule of the earnings press release. Also in the remarks, management may be making forward-looking statements and I ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release. Mr. Rajagopalan, I'll now turn the call over to you. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a record third quarter and I couldn't be more excited that Heidrick is hitting on all cylinders, showing dynamic year-over-year growth on the topline with more dollars flowing to EBITDA and significant margin expansion on the bottom line. Likewise, if we compare our performance this quarter to the same pre-pandemic period from 2019: number one, today's results show a dramatic 45% increase in net revenue to a record $264 million; number two, our adjusted EBITDA is 50% higher at $36 million; and number 3, our Q3 EBITDA margin has expanded by 55 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019 to almost 14%. Each of our three segments: Executive Search, Heidrick Consulting and On-Demand Talent contributed to another record-breaking quarter and the agility of the Heidrick team plus the value of our differentiated products and services, coupled with positive macro trends led to our impressive results. Our outlook for Q4 is robust and we expect to finish the year strong. Today, I'll start with a few thoughts on our strategic priorities, then discuss the important drivers in the quarter, and close noting a promising initiative we have underway that we believe is building the Heidrick brand and laying the foundation for long-term shareholder value creation. On the firm's continuing strategic focus, we feel very good about the business we've been building and expanding at Heidrick and we're positive about the future as we look ahead. We remain intent on increasing the scale and impact of our executive Search, Consulting and new On-Demand Talent business to deliver a unique set of premium services and offerings to our clients. As we drive forward, our integrated go-to-market approach, our teams across all three of our businesses are collaborating to deepen our client relationships and deliver the best of Heidrick in terms of recruitment, talent market insights, advisory solutions targeting important human capital opportunities, and on-demand talent; all to help our clients navigate the many complexities they face in ensuring their leaders, teams and organizations are future ready. And we will soon include broader tech enabled digital offering in our expanding and powerful portfolio. Here's a snapshot of the drivers of our business growth in Q3. The results we released today show the impact of our strategic focus and the resiliency and professionalism of the Heidrick team, all in the midst of an environment, where demand for our services and offerings is rebounding. Our net revenue over the last nine months alone of $717 million, exceeded the firm's prior annual full year record net revenue figures set in 2018, which bodes well for the rest of the year and for continued momentum in 2022. In Search, our net revenue grew by 33% in the third quarter compared to pre-pandemic third quarter 2019. All regions and all industry sector practices showed increases. The Executive Search business is robust for us at Heidrick with the number of confirmations increasing 33% this quarter versus the same quarter in 2019. For a couple of quarters now in 2021, our productivity per consultant has reached a remarkable and historic pinnacle of $2.4 million per consultant. This compares very favorably with our previous peak search productivity per consultant of $1.9 million in 2018 and $1.7 million in 2019. Balancing our past trends with our current pace, we see our productivity potentially reverting back to still impressive levels of around $2 million per consultant on average over the long run as we will continue to promote from within and higher strategically. In the meantime, I'm very proud of the amazing agility and capacity of the Heidrick team. The high volume of business in Search is the result of a number of key factors where change is creating strong demand from our clients and a more diversified revenue stream. We continue to see lots of change at the top of organizations. No matter if new leadership is needed due to dramatically different business conditions or business model transformation, multiple factors are driving the search for leadership, not only for CEOs, but also across the C-suite. Heidrick is seeking and winning the assignments to fill these roles. Many searches are underway due to the huge demand for diverse talent. As I mentioned on our last call, our U.S. diverse placements were tracking at over 50% of our total search work and we're seeing that trajectory continue. At the Board level globally, that figure is over 60%. Our sustainability and ESG work continues to grow worldwide as Boards and companies face ongoing pressure from stakeholders to focus on issues like climate change, sustainability and other forward-looking concerns. Our search consultants are engaged in filling important positions with highly sought after experienced professionals including CIO and data analytic roles, chief financial officers and supply chain executives. For example, we have 3 to 4 times the number of supply chain executive search assignments this year versus last year. And we are increasingly being asked to place more than one Director at a time on corporate boards. In fact, approximately one-quarter of all our Board engagements include placing more than one Board member. For Heidrick Consulting, net revenue for the quarter increased by 14% versus the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Initial projects are developing into longer-term initiatives as our consulting clients define, assess and develop future ready leaders, organizations and cultures. We have a unique ability to serve clients in all facets of their human capital journey and key assignments reflect growing corporate needs in four primary areas. First, with the recognition that top talent is an imperative for success, we have strong demand from clients for Heidrick's guidance on matters of leadership assessment and development and follow-on support and organization design. This is especially resonating in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East for senior and high potential leaders. Second culture, culture assessments and culture shaping are more important than ever as companies manage through hybrid and return to work environment and begin to reenergize and realign their teams. Third is around DE&I. Clients are seeking help defining and aligning on diversity strategies and embedding new ways of working that are equitable and inclusive. And forth with broad investor expectations increasing, not only for operational success, but also on the ESG front, our consulting teams are advising Boards of Directors on overall strategy and effectiveness. Turning to our third business segment, you'll remember that on April 1st of this year, we acquired Business Talent Group or BTG, forming the basis of our move into the compelling adjacency of on-demand talent with the leading pioneer in this space. With this move, Heidrick McCain, not only the first, but also the only global leadership advisory firm to offer On-Demand Talent Solutions at scale alongside our Search and Consulting services. We are excited about the $24 million contribution to revenue from On-Demand in Q3, which exceeded our expectations. In addition to the appeal of our unique high-end offering, external tailwinds such as macroeconomic growth, pent-up demand and talent shortages contributed to our success in the quarter. We saw particular strength from on-demand clients in financial services, consumer goods and healthcare and life sciences. While it is still early days, we view this segment as a key driver to our long-term value creation. The total addressable market for on-demand referrals is large and growing as clients see the need for fast, flexible talent, get more comfortable with filling their interim human capital and short-term project needs with remote or independent professionals. Critically, once our clients recognize the power of on-demand offering, they keep coming back to us to expand their use of on-demand to fill more roles. We believe we will continue to see strong growth in this sector. The outstanding effort and acumen exhibited by our Heidrick colleagues plus their disciplined attention to implementing our go-to-market strategy, drove our excellent results again this quarter. In addition, the dynamic world of work and other external factors such as new and emerging trends around leadership and culture plus the massive disruption from COVID, have created an imperative for our clients to reimagine themselves and find new ways of working. And in turn, these demands are driving our growth and success as our clients continue to seek quality, diverse and forward thinking talent, we're there every step of the way with our integrated suite of offerings. Before I turn the call over to Mark for more detail on the quarter, I want to share some background on the start of a new relationship that will help us expand our technology adjacencies and the Heidrick brand over the long term. At Heidrick, as I've said in the past, we're intensively focused on pursuing technological innovation, not only to leverage the way in which we work, but also to differentiate and provide leading-edge offerings to our clients. We're at the start of a multi-year digital journey with a long-term vision that expands Heidrick's suite of leadership solutions with innovative tech-driven digital offerings for future growth and shareholder value creation. On this dimension of our transformation, it is still very early days, but we expect, we'll be able to share more with you perhaps later next year. For now, in the digital arena, we're delighted with our recently announced partnership with Eightfold AI, a Silicon Valley based leader in the business of HR Tech and artificial intelligence driven talent solutions and platforms. With Eightfold AI, we believe we can offer organizations new, more powerful ways to make faster, smarter and more inclusive leadership decisions at scale and help them position leaders for optimal business success using an innovative digital first approach with AI driven insights, ultimately positioning Heidrick as the leader in driving the transformation of leadership. In addition, we're very pleased to welcome Meg Bear, Chief Product Officer of SAP SuccessFactors to Heidrick's Board of Directors. Undoubtedly Meg's more than 25 years of experience, building and scaling platforms, as well as for wealth of SaaS development, lifecycle, market and innovation experience will provide invaluable contributions from the boardroom as we continue to transform our business. The Heidrick's story is one of growth and innovation. We continually evolve to keep our core search and consulting business future ready, while we aggressively pursue opportunities and growing adjacent sectors like On-Demand Talent and incubate innovative digital products to continue our transformation. In closing, thank you to the entire Heidrick organization for their continued great work and for their valuable contribution, they make each and every day, all around the world for our clients. The Heidrick team like talent and human capital initiatives, we enable, is core to the value we generate and deliver to our shareholders now and into the future. With that, over to Mark. Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Krishnan, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Let me echo Krishnan's comments in that our go-to-market strategy productivity and focus on innovation, together with the favorable external trends, have translated into solid financial performance in the third quarter for Heidrick. We've been able to continue our top line, while expanding margins and we contributed increasingly more absolute dollars to EBITDA net income and earnings per share so far in 2021, all setting new annual records, let alone nine-month ending ones. Further, Heidrick's performance continues to remain strong into the fourth quarter, which I'm excited to share with you today. As has been a past practice, I'll start this afternoon with a run through on our third quarter results with most of my comments around sequential trends given the dislocation from the COVID period in the third quarter of 2020. I'll make further comments on a few balance sheet items that conclude with our fourth quarter outlook. Following that, we'll be happy to take your questions. You'll recall, last quarter, we celebrated the milestone of crossing over $200 million quarterly net revenue mark for the first time in Heidrick's history and I'm proud to say that not only did we do that again, but we added to it. Our third quarter net revenue of $263.8 million, which was 83.8% higher than last year's third quarter and 1.5% above the previous quarter in 2021, is a new record for the company. Even more interestingly, is that, for just the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we had cumulative revenue of $717.5 million, which is more than any annual achievement in the history of Heidrick with three more months to go. It's truly an exciting time in our growth cycle, which we see continuing into the near future. Let me give you some insights on the performance by turning to our three business segments: Executive Search net revenue was $221.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, just slightly lower by $2.5 million or 1.1% when compared to the second quarter of this year. Looking at our search results geographically, the Americas region was up by about 1% with modest downside contraction to about 5% in Europe and Asia when compared to the previous quarter. None of those contractions run expected due to the summer holidays and restrictions around the COVID delta variant and other factors, but the results in those regions were still very strong when compared to previous years. To give you some perspective, when we look at the Americas, Europe and Asia Executive Search performance in the third quarter and compare that to the average of the third quarters in 2018 and 2019, which were record periods for us, we saw increases in revenue of 38.2% percent, 18.1% and 18.4% in each region respectively. Please remember, those were not COVID periods, but prior historical highs and we are growing that much more. Thus you can see why we believe the third quarter is an exceptional one for Heidrick. We've had astonishing performance in 2021. Further along the top line growth, we have achieved new records and adjusted operating margins in Executive Search, which held near 21% in the third quarter. We have seen these margins continue to stay at those high levels in both the first and second quarters of this year. This is the result of continuing strong productivity numbers at $2.4 million per consultant this quarter. While this achievement is extraordinary than appears to be industry-leading, it's important to remember that this isn't likely to be sustainable given the promotions, new hires and work life balance we expect to achieve in 2022. Therefore, we would expect this to modulate around $2 million per consultant in the near future, which is still better than our previous historical levels and shows what the new normal is shaping up to be. For Heidrick Consulting third quarter net revenue rose to $17.9 million, up 4.5% sequentially. Consulting continues to benefit from collaboration within the company with nearly 50% of assignments in the first nine months of the year coming from leads through the Executive Search team in addition to new leads and engagements that are sold directly by the consulting team. The number of consultants was roughly flat at 66 and consulting confirmation value was up meaningfully year-over-year by almost 60%, but this declined 12% sequentially. This was due to lower confirmation values in Europe and Asia as a result of seasonality, such as August vacations in Europe. So like in Executive Search, it's important to note that the second quarter was a record confirmation value quarter for Heidrick Consulting, so being off on those highs is expected, but we're seeing continued strength at the end of the third quarter in terms of revenue backlog projects. Our newest On-Demand segment was exceeding expectations yet again, with revenue of $24.3 million in the third quarter. This is more than double last year when BTG was a stand-alone company and almost 30% higher than what was reported in the previous quarter. We saw a high number of value engagements with higher average initial project value and more engagement extensions extending beyond their initial agreement timing. Now let me turn to our expenses. With record setting third quarter net revenue and higher volume of work, naturally this comes with higher compensation and other variable costs. For example, we saw consolidated salaries and benefit expense of $185.9 million in the quarter, essentially flat with the previous quarter. Lower fixed compensation expenses, largely offset by variable compensation increases due to the growth of our business. When we look at general and administrative expenses, we saw $29.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 6.6% from the previous quarter's results. This increase of $1.8 million stem from some return to travel, build-out cost for our new strategic digital capability and other expansion cost to sustain our growth aspirations. Finally, we saw our cost of service expense increase to $18.7 million in the third quarter compared to $14.7 million in the previous quarter, which was primarily due to the revenue growth in our On-Demand Talent business segment. You will see the company recorded a restructuring credit of $3.3 million in the third quarter, which related to the early termination of our New York lease. This is beneficial for us given our old lease had a tale of another two plus years and now we're completely released from that financial obligation. Without the real estate credit, adjusted operating income was $30.1 million in the third quarter, leading to adjusted operating margin of 11.4% lower than 12.3% margin we had in the previous quarter. This was the result of very strong revenue achievement in our On-Demand Talent business where this segment has near breakeven margins given the stage of growth cycle that we're in and higher overall G&A from the growth of our business. That being said, we like what we see in our long-term trends expanding margins, where we look at our trailing 12-month consolidated adjusted operating margin, which is at an all time high now. Except for last year's disruption due to COVID, since 2014, our margins have been building steadily over the last 30 quarters, an achievement we are very proud of at Heidrick. This has all translated to adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million in the quarter or $102.6 million for the nine-month period ended, which has already surpassed any previous annual adjusted EBITDA performance. In fact, in 2018, our previous record for Heidrick, we saw annual adjusted EBITDA of $90.7 million. So, we are 13.1% ahead, with still one more quarter to add to it. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.3% year-to-date compared to the previous high of 12.7% in 2018, demonstrating the value we deliver to our shareholders this year. We finished the quarter with an effective tax rate of 27%, helping us deliver net income of $24.5 million, up 18% from the previous quarter and diluted earnings per share was $1.21 from $1.03 last quarter. Again, when looking at our nine months diluted earnings per share of $2.97, you will see that this is already an annual record with another quarter to go. Before turning to our balance sheet. I wanted to take a moment just to sum up our financial performance through September 2021 and that we're seeing unprecedented record levels of aggregate dollars and our bottom line achievement with margin expansion around the same. I believe these achievements and continued success will translate to more shareholder value as we continue to drive the business of Heidrick and that becomes understood by the market. Given our historical EBITDA and EPS achievements, which our legacy business are valued on in the market, coupled with our revenue growth in the On-Demand Talent business where there industry is valued on a revenue multiple due to the growth cycle, we believe this will lead us to increase shareholder value in the future on a sum of the parts basis. 2021 has truly become a pivotal year for Heidrick and we believe that can continue into 2022. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $348.3 million, which is $110.7 million more than the same quarter last year. As we discussed before, the Company's cash position typically build throughout the year as employee bonuses are accrued and are traditionally paid down in the first quarter of the following year. Our balance sheet, coupled with the renewed and expanded Heidrick's credit facility of $200 million moves our liquidity to over $0.5 billion. Clearly, our strong balance sheet puts us in a position of considerable strength to pursue the continued growth objectives that Krishnan discussed earlier on our call. Finally, let me turn to our fourth quarter guidance. Given the strong performance we are seeing in our markets and looking at our models, despite some anticipated and typical holiday slowdown in our business, we believe our first quarter net revenue will be in the range of $255 to $265 million, closing out 2021 very strong. Of course, this can change materially depending on whether we see COVID spikes, how governments and companies respond, as well as impacts on macro and acute business events such as supply chain storages, inflation and other unforeseen matters. Time will tell, but suffice it to say that we expect to set another quarterly record for the fourth quarter results. In conclusion, as Krishnan noted at the outset, we're very pleased with our performance, showing tremendous growth year-over-year and sustaining or building momentum sequentially. Our strategic initiatives implemented to drive growth in our legacy Search and Consulting businesses plus expansion from our recent On-Demand Talent acquisition and early days of our Eightfold AI partnership are creating springboards for Heidrick's continued success. With that. Krishnan and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator, over to you. Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Vogel from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst Thank you. Good afternoon, Krishnan and Mark. Certainly impressive results. I have a couple of questions to start kind of around consultant headcount. I'm curious, expectations for new consultant hires and promotions from within, I guess over the balance of this year and maybe even in early read on next year, and just kind of building off that. I'm curious, which industries or geographies, do you find yourself perhaps sitting with a headcount level that's a little bit lighter than where you want to be today given the end market demand you're seeing? Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Josh. Thanks for that question. Look, I think we're going to have a strong promotion cycle. We've got great talent and we're expecting to promote from within as usual. We're in the midst of going through all of that. So, I don't have all the details on that, but great class and strong, strong performances here by everybody. So, I think it will be a good promotion cycle for us. I think if we take a step back there, obviously, our needs in Europe and Asia is what I would say where we might be a bit lighter than where we'd like to be. So, we hope to address some of those needs through that. But look the Americas is just strong and strong performance everywhere and we'll reward those individuals as well through the cycle. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst I appreciate those insights. And I guess just thinking about the competitive landscape. Can you talk about any challenges or successes you're seeing in bringing talents aboard. Basically, are there any notable structural shifts you're seeing in the marketplace, whether it's comp structures for the consultants or anything with regard to the physical locations given the enablement to be remote? Just curious general thoughts on that. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Mark, feel free to add to this with what you see as well. Look, I don't think I see in the competitive landscape, too many, what I would say structural things. We have a lot of conversations going and I think the conversations that we've got going are around the platform that we're building, the culture that we've got in place here, how we collaborate and how we're tightly focused on still working at the executive levels at the top end and driving that success. And that resonates with a lot of people in some different platforms as well. So that's what I think is creating those conversations. I haven't seen anything yet structurally out there that is different, that are new things, others are doing that drives that more than these things that I'm saying. So it's about our success and our culture that I see out there. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst Great, thank you. And you talked about maybe some compression in consultant productivity, understandable, whether it's coming from promotions or new hires, but given the tech enablement of the business model and you're growing digital capabilities in general, do you think there is long-term upside to that 1 million number on a long-term basis? Kind of at the levels you're at today, do you think that could be a new base longer term once you're leveraging all the tech enablement in digital capabilities? Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Hey, Josh, it's Mark. Let me try to answer that for you. And I think in the prepared remarks, which you're going to -- what I discussed was being at $2.4 million today really kind of transitioning itself back to around the $2 million, which is obviously ahead from last year pre-COVID 2019 of $1.7 million. So the answer is it's in there. But as you and I both know the law of average is always going to play out. Right? So the market needs to be there. The hires that we use, which impact our denominator will have an impact on that number, as well as just general global expansion, where we think we need to add talent and where that is. It will probably be outside of America or the U.S., at least, in particular, which will mean typically lower retainers and that potentially could get productivity in a good way even though the numbers may look like they're averaging down, I think the revenue expansion will be well worth it. So, I think when you look at all those factors in play that's really why it drives itself down. We don't internalize that as we're not getting those efficiencies, we are, but sometimes when we mix it altogether, it can be hard to see and we'll try to give you clarity as we go through the process. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst I appreciate those insights. I just wanted to switch gears, maybe this is for you as well, Mark. Looking around the On-Demand Talent business, obviously, really strong result, we're seeing pent-up demand, talent shortages there. When we -- is that a good quarterly base for us to assume that the business can grow off of another -- another way, I guess to ask it is what's baked into your -- is that Q3 rate baked into your Q4 guidance. And I guess it's also a good time to remind me of what the norm -- if the seasonality is in the On-Demand Talent business? Thank you. Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer No, absolutely. Look the average of the two quarters that we've been public is around that $20 million, $21 million revenue number. We have built into our Q4 guidance, obviously, them continuing their trend, but really it's not going to continue into Q4. There definitely is some seasonality, holiday season approaching, is obviously in terms of how they bill and their revenue recognition etc., is going to be marginally impacted by that. I think the real question is we look at 2022. We still have an expectation that is a growth business and so that's the aspirations we have is to continue the general growth model, but again -- and I think you hit it right on, which is, it's really a function of, as the market continues, in our opinion, to move toward to gig economy and again project interim based work etc., and doing more of that, which is both the clients as well as the talent, wish to continue to explore those types of possibilities. It will be really interesting to see where this growth cycle goes. So a lot of optimism on our side regarding on how that's going to grow and it's being executed by an outstanding team over on that side. So I think the team over on the on-demand space is just really doing a good job of hitting the market very, very well and you're seeing that come through in the numbers. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst Really helpful. And I just would love to sneak in one more if I may. It's nice to see the operating loss rapidly narrowing at Heidrick consulting. Given the tech enablement and the digitization of the overall business, have you kind of reset what you think the quarterly run rate you need to get to for that business to get back into the black? Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer It's a great question. So I know we shouldn't have shown that for sure, Josh, you're going to push me on that one. And my opinion is still very strong that around that $80 million to $85 million annual mark is where you're going to see the breakeven and better. And I don't believe anything is changing that landscape. There might be some investment opportunities that will certainly give you those numbers as we kind of go through it in terms of our future and so you can kind of pro forma those some costs out. But just generally speaking in terms of what they're doing today and where they want to grow their business that is still a very, very safe bet. So my comment is kind of around if you want a quarterly, do that number, it would be about $21 million, $22 million a quarter. We should start to really get an expectation of seeing some interesting breakeven analytics and then hopefully again as that continues up its trend, which we made comments on as well, we should be able to see margins to the business. Josh Vogel -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst That's great. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions and great to see the business performing so well. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst If you could elaborate on the digital journey and transformation. And maybe help me understand what about the business model and income statement, whether its margins or growth that may change if you're successfully able to do what you want to do over the next several years? What are the outward signs we would see of that success? Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And Tobey, it's Krishnan. I didn't catch the first part of -- were you speaking about our new digital relationship or were you speaking more broadly than that. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst More broadly and then I'm going to have a follow-up about the specific recent relationships. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. Great. Yes. So if we continue on the tech enablement of all of our current businesses, OK. And it's a journey that we're committed to and we're driving hard and you're going to see that again as you've already seen with our ability to take on this productivity that we've been able to do from the past. I think you'll see that with stickiness of client relationships, our ability to build out accounts. You'll be able to see that there and over time that's going to translate to margin as well. So, you're going to be able to see that. I think, on the existing technology journey that we're on with our new relationships and what we're trying to do here. If I just summarize that, I think we're in a world today where I kind of say talent, if you want to call it human capital, is the capital that's now most in demand, if you go and I believe if you go in -- I believe if you go to any survey at the end of this year on from CEOs and others, you're going to see that pop its head. So there's going to be this emerging -- and there already is expectation that data and insights on talents and executive talent should be as readily available as we have on other business dimensions. So we think that with our IP insights, the platform and solutions that we're going to build with a company like Eightfold AI, we can bridge that gap and lead the transformation of leadership as well. So that's something that I think that we're headed down the path. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Krishnan, let me just ask, does it mean the business becomes more profitable because less is done, less processes have human intervention, what are the financial outcomes that your strategy will achieve? Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So, yes, I think that strategy will create new service offerings and new line of business. So, you're going to see -- we're answering some new problems that have been previously solved in bespoke fashion by a myriad of companies. Okay. So I think it's a whole new revenue stream that we believe is going to be higher margin as well just given how one addresses those -- that solutions head as well. So you'll see both. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Okay. And then as productivity per consultant revenue per job eventually perhaps comes down to this $2 million figure, will your other smaller businesses that are sub-scale and therefore sub -- it's sort of an ongoing goal of profitability, will those be able to drive sufficient margin such that margin won't have to come down as productivity is coming down or should we think of margin kind of tracking that productivity at some point? Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Well, everything is -- and Tobey, it's mark, everything is a function of scale, right? So I think the answer is on a set of service basis on what we're seeing in the prior quarter, if our productivity were to come down and by definition, yes, we'd see some margin creep into that. Having said that, remember when the productivity comes down, which means the revenue comes down and people not going through the tiers, no way that we do kind of our payment so to speak, those would obviously in sync also come down. So it's not exactly a one-to-one ratio. Having said that, and again, as we look at other markets, those are going to be very different profitabilities depending on, we've got the U.S. versus let's say parts of Latin America, etc., which actually can drive even higher margins so to speak, because the cost is very different in terms of the revenue cost distribution. So, it's always hard to answer that question because it's really a function of where it's coming from, it's not necessarily. I would tell you is unless focused on that and I'm not focused on, I'm less focused on that, what I like to see is how it trans all the way down to the bottom line, where again, our equity shareholders are seeing again nearly $3 EPS year-to-date. We typically were $2.50 all-in for the year before that and that's really where I think you're going to see that accretive value come in because what we're able to achieve is more net income without additional equity and that shareholder dilution, so to speak, is not there. And the more we can execute on the strategy that Krishnan was rightly pointing out in terms of potential other products and services, we'll continue that path. So, I think it's still very, very accretive for the shareholders in terms of what we're doing, less so again about the operating margin side of it from my perspective. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Okay. And then, Krishnan, I had promised you a follow-up on the specific new relationships that you've -- that you press released and discussed in your prepared remarks. I know you're laying down some breadcrumbs as to exactly what that is. But could you maybe give us an example of what that will solves for our customer? Thanks. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, look I'm going to be pretty high level on this just given where we are and some of the breadcrumbs and what we're trying to build over here. But I think, when I think about complex problems that are bespoke that executives also face visibility into their DE&I pipelines, etc., and things like that. These are real problems that are occurring in today's world and how do we create that and how do they understand that. So that just would be an example. Okay. But let's just say a small example and part and parcel to a larger solutions that we could drive, there would be things like that. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Okay. And then I had just a broad market question and I'll get back in the queue. Does -- how is the ability to do remote work at all levels within an organization all the way up to [Indecipherable], how is that influencing wage rates and therefore fee levels because I guess it could go both ways where you can get some more expensive people to do work remote in different locations, but potentially it could go the other way too. How is that working in the business? Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, let me start off with that and Mark you probably have some numbers behind our searches. So I think on the Executive Search side, we don't really see it having a huge impact right now. Okay. Our retainers and our average fee for search etc., are all very, very strong. And we do see balancing that perhaps on the On-Demand Talent side, a desire to be able to leverage talent in a different way and driven by the ability to work remotely and talent to be residing remotely as well. So we see another avenue opening up over there as well and all kind of being driven by the same thing. So, I still kind of see it currently as a net positive for us. Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, I'll -- just a little bit on the math side of it. What we're starting to see in terms of average retainers and our engagements is trending back toward the kind of work pre-COVID, maybe a little bit higher, but I would say meaningfully. Obviously, it's the volume of work that's generating a lot of revenue value, but having said that, we are seeing uptick on certain engagement come in strong, again not so much, obviously, I would say in the CEO board side of it, but there are other aspects that we're starting to see a little bit of the war on talent kind of creeping itself in. But for the most part, Tobey, what I'd tell you is clearly the the pure demand side of it is really what's driving those results for the most part. Tobey Sommer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes the line of Kevin Steinke of Barrington Research. Your line is now open. Kevin Steinke -- Barrington Research -- Analyst Hey, good afternoon. So we've obviously been talking a lot here about the digitization and tech enablement of your business model. With -- specifically with regard to search, have you kind of dove in, in terms of productivity metrics and besides annualized revenue per consultant and how maybe those are changing and how sustainable maybe some of those changes are? I'm thinking of to speed at which you can complete an Executive Search or the number of searches per consultant, maybe how much that has improved or could improve given digitization in tech enablement? So, I guess any commentary on those specific metrics or any others you might be monitoring would be helpful? Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. Let me try to give you some color on that. I think the first one is on your question on the closure rate and the speed at which we're transacting. Obviously, it has been accelerated through COVID without people needing to travel on planes and go through their interview process. We've seen our days to close pre-COVID to even today fall of about 20% in terms of the average days to close. We're starting to see a very slight uptick in that and for the most part its spanning is up pretty well and we would expect again with Zoom and other technologies that our digital assessment ability etc., would hopefully roll into the fact that we can keep that pretty constant and that should obviously help us in terms and that's obviously been quite efficient. I think the other element, kind of what you're thinking through, Kevin, is when we look at the G&A, right? So, we thought G&A fall away to 11% as a percentage of revenue, where it used to be 18% and almost nearly 25% at its peak before that, I don't see us playing in that space in terms of 18%, 19%. I think it will be somewhere in the midpoint between the two, long term or at least medium term I should say versus long term because we do not see the return back to people flying all over the place and -- or again candidates, etc., and again in terms of our business development, etc., everything has been pretty unanimously accepted by doing things. By assume, it still requires a touch point, so we will see a bit of decline. And that's why I'm using the midpoint of the G&A side of it, but we'll see some of that come back, but not nearly to what it used to be. And I think that is what I would call the permanent leverage side of it and then as we go through the way that we want to digitally transcend ourselves in Search and Heidrick Consulting and On-Demand Talent as well, that's where it's really going to be very, very interesting in terms of what we're able to achieve as we kind of go through that in the next 12, 24 months in terms of the platforms that we're trying to create over here and really seeing what that can generate in terms of efficiencies on our core business, as well as our potential new business lines that we're thinking through. Kevin Steinke -- Barrington Research -- Analyst Okay, great, that's helpful. Appreciate that. And when you're -- you've been talking about the normalization to more of the $2 million revenue per consultant level. I believe you said you see that happening in the near term. Are we just kind of thinking about -- should we think about the next promotion cycle, kind of first quarter 2022, we start to normalize to that level or I guess it depends on what's happening with revenue and demand as well. But just how are you thinking about it in your planning? Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer We don't see in terms of kind of the current market conditions, at least, what we're experiencing at Heidrick a big drop off. We still talk to our clients. We're still getting a lot of that showing that it still seems to be full-court press. Obviously, we gave a guidance number. I think that's assuming we come out within our range and that's still showing very, very good strength in the Q4 and we'll see, obviously, it's always hard to predict this market if you wanted to. But we do think that will continue its pace. Yes, the promotional side of it will impact the denominator in the trailing 12 months. So, it's not necessarily spike down. It will average back down on its own even if we kept to those levels. But I think what we're really trying to say is look as you assume this kind of normalizes, if I can use that word Q4 next year that's really where I think again if I did the math, it would kind of come down to that $2 million and potentially really hold at that level again because of the efficiencies and the way that we do our searches, days to close and ability to help people do more without obviously over taxing them is really what we're trying to achieve. Kevin Steinke -- Barrington Research -- Analyst Okay. Yes. Great. That's helpful. I guess just lastly, you've touched on it, quite a bit, but just you mentioned there that the demand is still strong. I mean, what --and some of the factors you see going on here in terms of the demand picture leadership changes, a lot of leadership changes in the C-suite, ESG, diversity and inclusion; are you thinking about these as having some real kind of multiyear legs in terms of the growth in demand cycle or I guess are you feeling like we're in the earlier or later innings of some of these things that are [Speech Overlap]? Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Kevin, it's Krishnan here. Yes, I still think we are in the early innings of that, OK. Sustainability very early innings, OK. We've made some nice progress on on DE&I, but it's still the early innings on that. There's still digital transformation that's occurring in many industries. Still, there's lots of private equity capital that's still sitting out on the sidelines. So, there's a lot of things going on in their new trends out there as well that we can capture. So, I think this is -- there are trend lines out there that will continue for a bit. Kevin Steinke -- Barrington Research -- Analyst Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Congratulations on the results. Mark Harris -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time, I'll now turn the conference back to Mr. Rajagopalan for closing remarks. Krishnan Rajagopalan -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you for joining us. Clearly, look the results we announced today were outstanding. We're working very hard to continue to deliver growth and value to Heidrick clients into our shareholders, all within the framework of our strategic pillars that we've spoken to before: first, growing the scale and impact of both our search and consulting lines of business and delivering that premium services experience. Second, expanding the development of leadership solutions and capabilities to address new and ongoing client imperatives such as the On-Demand Talent space. And third, investing in new product development and strategic expansion into adjacent and complementary areas with innovative, tech driven offerings as well. We look forward to updating you again next quarter. Until then, thank you all so much and take care.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bruce Rosenbloom. Bruce S.

Let me now introduce our newly appointed CEO and President, Matt Hulett. Matt? Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Bruce. Good morning and thank you for joining us. My name is Matt Hulett, I'm the new CEO PetMed. I'm incredibly honored and enthusiastic to join this iconic company and I'm excited to be on this earnings call today. I would like to begin by thanking Bruce Rosenbloom for acting as Interim Chief Executive Officer prior to my arrival. Before we update you on our progress in Q2, I would like to first share my personal thoughts and motivations regarding why I'm so optimistic about PetMeds in our future. First, I'd like to introduce you to my dog, Harry, who was featured on this slide. He is the latest addition to our family and he is also a puppy. In fact, Harry's is the first thought to my family. Our family had no idea what we are getting ourselves into. It's like having a new newborn again and as many of you fellow pet parents now, parties can be challenging. We also can't imagine not having Harry in our lives, and we think of him as a member of our family. Personally, it is fulfilling to be involved in an organization where you can spend your time and energy on a business that has positive social impacts on society while you're focused on generating returns for shareholders. Now that we've established my personal connection to the business, I'd like to spend some time walking through the rationale as to why I believe PetMeds is a great long-term investment. Having a large addressable market is important. It enables us more optionality for new brands and products to be developed. It provides more opportunity to develop a myriad of go-to-market strategies, target at different cohorts of customer segments. This also means that there is room for more market participants and for those market participants to co-exist and flourish. The pet industry's total addressable market is very large and it is growing. Currently, it is over $100 billion and the service addressable pet medication market, where we participated today is approximately $10 billion. We are one of the leading pet pharmacies today and as such, I see a future where we can extend our already sizable customer reach combined with our widely respected and known brand into additional segments of the total pet care market as our future vision comes fully into focus. In addition to the benefits of participating in a large market, the market timing is also considerably favorable. Pet ownership has always been high in the United States, but we have seen an increase in pet ownership especially due to the macro effects of COVID-19. Pet ownership has surged to record heights, and now 7 out of 10 US households own a pet. Those new and existing pet parents will need more pet medications and other related healthcare services for their pet family members. As we have seen in other digital e-commerce verticals, the adoption curve of the digitization of retail is a favorable tailwind. This pull forward of digital-based retail experiences has now given customers a taste of the future and has created new buying habits of purchasing more products and services online. Today, our addressable market is largely dominated by offline sales and we see the trend to purchase online is clearly very favorable to us. Pet parents see their pets as an extension of their own family and they are increasingly demanding more healthy pet care options for their furry friends. We see this as a positive trend for PetMeds and an opportunity. For example, we have increased the number of products that we carry and have started to include specialty dog food and higher end wellness products, which we believe have contributed to the increase in our average customer order value. Lastly, just like we've seen in the human healthcare market, COVID-19 accelerated the increasing trend for the digitization of healthcare. In fact, in the pet market, for the first time, regulations related to in-person veterinary visits and prescription fulfillment were temporarily waived and moved online in unprecedented ways. We think this opens the door to the acceleration of digital-based telehealth services. As I look at the business, there are several key competitive advantages that we can leverage in the future. First, our brand is widely known and trusted. Having a strong brand takes years to develop and our customers look to PetMeds as their trusted pharmacy and as their pet medication experts. Second, we have strong operational and quality efficiency as a pharmacy. Our customer care integration with our pharmacy is world class, which ensures that customers get their products delivered quickly, but also accurately and our vet partners receive high quality fulfillment and service delivered through our vet platform. Our deep experience with the vet community is a latent competitive advantage. We currently have one of the largest direct-to-consumer vet networks in the online retail space. PetMeds has a large network of over 70,000 veterinarians that we have worked with over the Company's history. Our online vet portal currently has 17,000 veterinarians and vet clinics. This is a core capability and asset because it enables us to expand our fulfillment capability as we scale our business. Our prescription medication authorization rates are the highest they have ever been, which speaks volumes, the level of veterinary and cooperation we receive. Our pet pharmaceutical category expertise is something that I view as a unique strength. Being a differentiated provider allows PetMeds to focus our offering, especially if the market continues to get even more competitive. Again, more to come on where we see our brand and business growing in the coming months. PetMeds has long enjoyed close bonds with many of our supplier partners. Those relationships have developed over time to become even more strategic. Today, we have direct relationships with all of our major suppliers and we partner with them to market their products to our customer base. Our customer service and overall customer centricity, ethos permeates our culture and our team. I personally sat in on hours of phone calls between our customers and our service agents and I've never experienced such a tightly integrated and empathetic customer-centric organization in my entire career. We don't just have a transactional interaction with our customers, we have built trusted relationships. Before we comment on our earnings performance, I would like to reiterate several compelling reasons to invest and to continue to invest in PetMeds. PetMeds has several core fundamentals that are compelling, including a strong balance sheet. We do not have debt, we have over $100 million in cash and we are cash flow positive. We have a long history of providing shareholder returns throughout a dividend and a strong return on equity that has been historically over 30%. We have started to build a recurring subscription base to our customers with a program, which we just recently launched in July of this year. Through our new Autoship & Save program, where we are building higher lifetime value and recurring relationships with our customers. In September, approximately 20% of our customers signed up in order via our Autoship & Save subscription program and that number continues to rise. Our customers responded very positively and enrollment in Autoship & Save has increased steadily throughout the quarter. We expect many of our reorder sales to eventually transition to Autoship & Save by the end of our fiscal year, which will only continue to strengthen our relationship with our customers. We also continue to have a large a base of returning customers, which is an indication of the quality of service and the value that we deliver to our customers. So to sum up the core Company's strengths, we have over 25 years of experience as a pure-play pet pharmacy fully licensed in 50 states, delivering fantastic service and value, which is recognized by our customers and continues to be rewarded with their loyalty. Our NPS score is over 80, which puts us in the upper quartile along with some of the most beloved brands in the world. We are a direct to consumer brand with a rapidly growing addressable market and we have successfully serviced more than 2 million active customers over the last two years. Now, I would like to have Bruce Rosenbloom, our Chief Financial Officer to review our financials for the quarter. Bruce S. Rosenbloom -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Matt. Now, we'll review the financial results. We will compare our second fiscal quarter ended on September 30, 2021 to last year's quarter ended on September 30, 2020. And in some cases, we'll refer back to September 30, 2019. Similar to the quarter ended June 30, 2021, we faced a unique situation comparing two totally different environments between 2020 pandemic and 2021 post-pandemic. We were coming off a strong September quarter last year, which was primarily driven by increased e-commerce demand as a result of the pandemic, which caused many retail stores to close and many veterinarians to be unavailable. However, during the most recent quarter, while the pandemic was abating and retail stores and veterinarians were open for business, the advertising market continue to surge with increased demand, dramatically driving up CPC and CPM rates by more than 30%. As a result, we spent approximately 33% less in advertising due to these cost increases. For the second fiscal quarter ended on September 30, 2021, sales were $67.4 million compared to sales of $75.4 million for the same period, the prior year, a decrease of 10.7%. But sales were only down 3.6% versus the quarter ended September 30, 2019, prior to the pandemic. The decrease in sales was due to decreases in both new order and reorder sales. Our sales were negatively impacted by a much more competitive market and credit advertising space with substantially higher costs compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, during the past six months, there was a dramatic increase in veterinary visits by both pet owners who were unable to visit their veterinarian during the pandemic. We believe the increase in veterinary visits was primarily due to pet owners needing to visit their veterinarians for their pet exams and to renew their prescriptions. Since some pet owners purchase medications directly from their vets, during the visit, the Company believes that has negatively impacted sales and especially reorder sales during the quarter. We were disappointed with our sales results during the quarter, however, sales were trending more positive in the month of August and September 2021 when you compare them to August and September 2019. Reorder sales decreased by 8.5% to $62 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of $67.8 million for the same quarter last year, while for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, our reorder sales were $61.9 million. Encouragingly, reorder sales in the most recent quarter was down versus a year ago, were up slightly compared to 2019 pre-pandemic. We would expect to see stronger reorder sales in the back half of fiscal 2022 as we anticipate more prescriptions being renewed. A positive trend to highlight for the quarter was the continued increase in our average order size. Our average order value was approximately $92 for the quarter compared to $87 for the same quarter last year and $85 for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. The increase in AOV can be attributed to a shift in our product mix to more prescription items and less over-the-counter items with prescription items having a higher gross margin profile in comparison to over-the-counter items. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the advertising market was extremely competitive and this increased demand drove our bad prices dramatically. As a result, our advertising spending was less efficient than usual and delivered fewer impressions than in prior years. Because of this, we believe our advertising spending was less effective in the most recent quarter and its ability to attract new customers. New order sales decreased by 30% to $5.4 million for the quarter compared to $37.7 million for the same quarter of the prior year. We acquired approximately 65,000 new customers in our second fiscal quarter compared to 96,000 for the same period the prior year. However, we anticipate that advertising prices should revert back to more normal levels as the pandemic further subsidies, which should help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our media spending and thereby continue to help us gain more new customers in the future. We are also in the process of reevaluating many of our current marketing relationships, which has resulted in changing some of our marketing partners with the expectation of improved marketing efficiency and results. For the second fiscal quarter, net income was $6.3 million or $0.31 diluted per share compared to $8.4 million or $0.42 diluted per share for the same quarter last year, a decrease to net income of 25%. For the second fiscal quarter, our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 28.5% compared to 30.5% for the same period a year ago. The percentage decrease for the quarter can be attributed to some of the major manufacturers shifting their funding from discounting product costs to cooperative marketing rebates. There may be an opportunity to improve gross margins in the second half of fiscal year 2022 if the shift to prescription medications continue. We had $106.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $90.7 [Phonetic] million in inventory with no debt as of September 30, 2021. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share on the Company's common stock. The dividend will be payable on November 19, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 8, 2021. The Company continues to be committed to returning capital to our stockholders. However, the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors each quarter following its review of the Company's financial performance. This ends the financial review. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Questions and Answers: Operator We will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti. Please proceed with your questions. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. So welcome, Matt. Welcome back, Bruce. So, as far as new order sales, I mean obviously you guys did have certainly felt the impact of the advertising market being lower, but kind of what gives you confidence that things will bounce back in the back half of the fiscal year? Just curious as to what's driving that ad? Maybe perhaps, are you seeing some good results -- better results so far in the current quarter. Just wondering about your confidence level, about your ability to bounce back with the new order sales. Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Anthony, this is Matt, and thanks for the question. Great to hear from you, again. And then Bruce, feel free to chime in. A couple of things about that. One is, I would say, that we're taking a small bites too fast approach to looking at our new customer acquisition. We basically have rewired our entire marketing partnerships and agencies in the last, I would say, I've been here two months so we've done that in the last four weeks. And now, we'll be rolling out very soon. So, we're looking at our capital allocation spend to where we spend. I think we've been spending too aggressively in some channels where we haven't seen the return and we haven't been taking advantage of new sources of traffic, where we actually think we have a lot of advantage. That's one. Two is we're spending a lot more time rewiring our system and databases around tracking our customers better and really focusing on reengagement. And for rates in general, we are seeing some changes to the rates out there. I think some of the channels like Facebook have obviously got more expensive due to the loss of first party data due to the Apple's IDFA decisions. So, those are some channels that obviously I think are just still getting hotter in terms of increased CPMs and CPCs. But in others, we're seeing favorable trends. So, it depends on the channel, but for us, we're really looking at each channel and seeing how we get the incrementality of each channel which is different than what we did in the past. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst Okay. Got it. Okay. And then in terms of your gross margins, now you did mention that you have been shipping more items like specialty dog which obviously is much heavier than typical pet medications. So, as we look to refine our models here, like, how should we think about as you -- on the one hand, it sounds like you're doing a good job of increasing your AOV but how is the margin -- gross margin impact going to be because of that? Bruce S. Rosenbloom -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Anthony, I'm going to take that question if you don't mind. As far as our margins for the past quarter, we have as we may be spoken offline before, but our vendors shifted funding to our co-op marketing in lieu of discounting products. And this negatively impacted our gross margins during the quarter and it will probably be like that going forward, where instead of getting price discounts off the price of the items or the inventory, these rebates and these promotions are going to be below the line as they are in the advertising line item. So as far as moving forward with gross margins, you'll see that -- that's an overriding factor, but however as we've also seen our shift moving back to more prescription than OTC, we do expect a positive trend of margins moving forward because of that going back to some semblance of normalcy pandemic versus post-pandemic when it comes to our mix shift of items. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the capital allocation, just curious to get your thoughts, Matt as far as looking at pets for years, the Company has been a company with a lot of cash and growing the dividend and sort of maintaining a very healthy cash position. Just wanted to get your thoughts about that -- how should think about that, especially the dividend. What are your thoughts there? Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think there are several things to unpack there. It's a great question and I've been a long listener of pets earnings calls as well. So, I'll try to give a slightly different answer. I would say with the dividend, we're always looking at that and it's always subject to change but we've been pretty consistent with the dividend and nothing to announce here obviously. But to your cash question, with over $100 million in cash with interest rates being so low there -- I think there's a lot of opportunities in this space to deploy cash and allocate capital more efficiently to get higher returns. There is also a lot of businesses in the pet ecosystem that fortunately in this market different than other verticals, there's a lot of ways to partner, a lot of ways to look at M&A as well. So, we're certainly going to be looking at those in the future since we do have such a large cash position. And lastly, it's a little early for me to articulate the strategy. I've been around for two months. I think the first four weeks felt like six months because there was a lot to do and learn and now I'm kind of selling in and feeling better about things. But yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunity to deploy capital differently, especially given the tailwinds in pet ownership. So, that's kind of a non-answer answer, Anthony, other than I think we're taking a fresher look at that and I would expect that we will make some decisions in the coming quarters that we'll obviously update everyone on. Anthony Lebiedzinski -- Sidoti -- Analyst Got it. Okay. Well thanks, and best of luck going forward. Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Anthony. Operator And our next question is from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Steph Wissink -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. And the first is I wanted to just go back to some of the comments in your prepared remarks around vet visits. And I think I head you correctly that there is an inverse correlation meaning when vet visits go up, you tend to see vets sell prescription and OTC directly and so your business feels that impact. Is that the right way to think about it or is there a net second derivative, wherein follow-up to those primary prescriptions, you'll start to see some of the secondary prescription refills in your business? Bruce S. Rosenbloom -- Chief Financial Officer Hi, Steph. This is Bruce. Now let me address that question. Really the vet visits inform, there really to try to give an understanding of what we were seeing last year versus this year. Last year, during the pandemic, virtually all the vet offices were closed and there really wasn't many alternatives where our pet owners can turn to for medications and many were trying online pet medications for the first time. And so, that was definitely something that we welcomed last year. This year, all those clinics were open for business and they're making up for lost time. So, they're making sure, if they haven't seen that pet in a 12-month period, they're enforcing and making sure that pet owner is coming into their clinic. So, it's almost a resetting of the prescription cycle and many of the pet owners are going to vet, buying there, and then we're in line for the refill and we can sort of through our data, we know when it's time for a reorder and we'll go ahead and market for that reorder -- subsequent reorder and we expect to see that in the second half of this fiscal year is what I was referring to earlier in the call. Steph Wissink -- Jefferies -- Analyst Okay. Got it. And then my second question is on ad spend. I think you mentioned both, that you expect advertising prices to revert. I'm curious if you could just give us a sense of, do you expect them to go back to pre-pandemic levels on a purchasing price basis or do you still expect there to be a bit of inflation post-pandemic? And related to that, I think you also used the word -- words less efficient. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're doing to tweak your marketing mix or your marketing plans out over the next couple of quarters to try to improve some of the efficiency even if the costs remain a little bit elevated? Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I'll take your second question first. A couple of things. I would say, overall, the way in which we've been purchasing media is going to change significantly. We're looking at new and have actually implemented new marketing partners to help us with that, that specialize in specific areas of media. I won't get into the channels themselves, but obviously Google, Facebook, Connected TV, there is a lot of options out there and I think the way we've configured media spend to date needed a fresh pair of eyes, so that's one. Two is, just adding more data around the decisions that we're making around our media buys with another, I would say, quick-win that we've implemented. And then lastly to your first question, media rates have been dancing around quite a bit. I was in the language learning space prior to this with Rosetta Stone and we took advantage of favorable rate during the pandemic because advertisers were leaving things like brand advertising to performance. I would say going into the holiday season, it's too early to tell since it's a very competitive time to be buying advertising. But I would say that I'm a little bit more optimistic about rates than I was when I started two months ago. Steph Wissink -- Jefferies -- Analyst Okay. That's great. Thank you for the help. Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ben Rose with Battle Road Research. Please proceed with your question. Ben Rose -- Battle Road Research -- Analyst Yes. Good afternoon. And I know we haven't had a chance to meet, Matt, but I look forward to meeting you post-call. A couple of questions with regard to pet health advice. On your slides, Matt, you talked about the growth in the telehealth market and I was just curious to know what thoughts you have with regard to the Ask the Vet service that you offer now and whether you envision that being expanded in some way or perhaps being monetized in some way in the future? Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Ben, and looking forward to catching up in subsequent conversations. Yeah, I'm really excited about the pet telehealth space. There has been a lot of innovation in this space. There is a lot of different start-ups that I had talked to personally in the space to get some advice. I think the way I'd start is, I always try to evaluate businesses not only on the TAM and the timing and the kind of the fundamentals but also the customer relationships. An inordinate amount of our customers are wanting additional services from us, they almost -- they are giving us permission to give them more advice than we are today. Because prescriptions are in a way the milk of the back of the proverbial store with the customer because they see PetMeds as the expert in pet healthcare. It just so happens as the customer is leading the store. We're not providing a lot of expert experience yet. And so, I see pet telehealth is us being very well positioned to add additional services that we don't do today because customers really view as that specialty pharmacies, they're not viewing it as the mega-retailer with lots of different services. We're not known for selling food, we're not selling -- known for selling dog toys. We're known for providing expert advice. And so for pet telehealth, while the market is really small, I see it as an opportunity to engage with our Autoship customers in really unique ways and then sell them additional services. So nothing to announce, but we're certainly going to be doing a lot of testing even this quarter on this, which I hope -- hopefully be able to talk to you about next time. Ben Rose -- Battle Road Research -- Analyst Okay. Great. And with regard to the Company's relationships with the veterinarian community and vet clinics, this is the first time that I heard you quantify the number of veterinarians in clinics that you work with and find that to be an intriguing opportunity. Was curious to know plans that you have to perhaps reduce friction with the veterinarians or to improve relationships with them. Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Ben, thanks for noticing that. And it was intentional to put that in there because I was quite surprised when I first started the Company. We have a vet portal that's used today. I've seen other competitors in this space quote numbers, and I think still might be surprised that we have a larger network than most. I think our relationship with vets has been a little confrontation, to be honest, over the span of the Company when we first started, because we are the pioneers in this space. I think when we -- we would go to the veterinary conferences, we are probably the least likely to be welcomed. And I think now there is other players in this space and we've kind of opened the door for them. And I think we're kind of seen as a more friendly player in this space, to be honest. Our vet verification rates are as high as they've ever been. I think there's a lot of things we could do in our vet portal to make the veterinarians' life easy. We're very sympathetic to veterinarians. They are overworked. They have some of the highest suicide rates of any profession. And I think that there is a lot we can do to be a better friend of the vet. And our vet portal, I think, has a great start but I think there's a lot of opportunity to automate what they do in their clinics. And we're going to be pro vet in terms of how we approach the market, our intent is not to be anti-vet. Ben Rose -- Battle Road Research -- Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Ben. Operator And our questions and answers portion of the call has ended. I would now like to turn the call back to Matt Hulett, the Company's CEO for his concluding remarks. Matt Hulett -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. I want to reiterate what Bruce just covered in his financial highlights section. We are disappointed with our sales results for the quarter. But after my two months on the job, I'm confident there is much we can do and will do to improve our business growth. To be clear, in a market that's growing, PetMeds needs to be -- make the necessary changes to our operating playbook to take advantage of the market trends. In my first weeks here, I've listened in on countless customer service calls, engaged with over 20 pet industry leaders, brief research analysts and engaged with our own main pharmaceutical partners. I've already seen a lot of core areas that we can and have already begun to improve in this business and these include the following. Using more data insights to acquire and retain customers, better segmentation of our customer base in order to drive more mass personalization of our offers and services, improved new customer acquisitions through a different allocation of variable marketing spend, expanded product and services that are already being demanded by our customers. Since I've only been with PetMeds for a short period of time, I'm not ready on today's call to provide a comprehensive future strategy or capital allocation plan for the business and that would be premature. However, I do have a 90-day -- 180-day plan that I presented to our Board of Directors and I'll be sharing more about our vision and strategy with you during our Q3 earnings call. But I will say this today, we firmly believe that we can take advantage of the large market tailwinds, leverage the main core strengths we highlighted today and execute on a broader strategic vision for the Company. We look forward to briefing you in the coming quarters on our strategy and our progress. Thank you for listening in. Operator, this ends the conference call.

NorthWestern Corporation ( NASDAQ:NWE ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 3:30 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer -- continue to be under recovery of electric supply costs and you see that impact reflected in $106.9 million increase overall year-to-date in electric supply -- or overall energy supply costs and you can see the breakout at the bottom between electric and natural gas. From a quarter perspective, that's about a $20 million continuing trend as we think about it year-to-date. Slide 10, the non-GAAP earnings slide. I would point you to a couple of things here. Again, we've already talked about the impact ongoing of favorable weather and you will see for the quarter $0.05 of favorable weather that we remove that compares to $0.01 of unfavorable weather in the prior quarter. The other item I would mention here is again that mark-to-market of the QF liability adjustment there with $0.02. So when you look at the quarter of $0.68 on a diluted EPS basis adjusted to $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis compared to the prior period of $0.58 of earnings adjusted to $0.59, so that's $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis compared to $0.59, again driven by margin improvement offset by some higher operating costs. Slide 11, I would mention that the quarter again was in line with our expectations. I'll remind you that in Q2 we narrowed in our guidance a bit. We had a wider range at the beginning here of $0.20. We narrowed that down to $0.15 and have reaffirmed our guidance for '21 at $3.43 to $3.58 per diluted share. And Q2, we also discussed that we expect proceeds of $200 million in '21 from our equity offering and that's driven by higher capital, but also remind you we had delayed equity from 2020 and in '21 are executing on that. We are on track for $450 million of capital in 2021, which is a higher number than we've been at in prior years. So with that, expect to stay consistent with our guidance for 2021 and then broadly we're close to EEI here in a couple of weeks. And with that, we're looking forward to discussing with you our plans in 2022 including both guidance, capital program and also where we will be going from an equity needs perspective. So, Bob, back to you. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Crystal, it sounded like you were selling tickets to EEI. Good job. A couple of regulatory items. First concerning the Power Cost Credit Adjustment Mechanism. We had requested -- we requested approval to increase the base forecast given that the existing PCAM really is energy driven, not capacity driven. We implemented an interim of about $17 million of loss replacer [Phonetic], pardon me. Anyways, we implemented the interim subsequently. Then the consumer council filed a motion arguing that the PCAM can only be adjusted in a general rate case. We were disappointed that the Commission granted that motion to dismiss. However, we have not seen a written order. When we do see that, we will evaluate and certainly have the opportunity to request reconsideration. Our view is that under the tariff, the PCAM base may be reset outside of a rate case. Second, concerning our decoupling mechanism. As you know, we requested that that be suspended early on in COVID as the disparate direction of the residential and C&I sectors really highlighted that the mechanism was a mismatch to its intended purpose. And the Commission voted to grant our request to suspend. We consider that a real positive. The consumer council had requested reconsideration and that was denied. So that's a very good outcome. And then finally, I know we'll come back and talk about this. On May 19, we had filed a request for approval of three capacity resources, including our Laurel plant and we withdrew that request simply to manage the supply chain issues and we're very much going ahead with the Laurel plant. Brian will come back and talk about that. A couple other regulatory matters really below the radar. FERC has initiated a routine audit covering the years 2018 to present. We responded to quite a few data requests. Haven't yet received a report, but that is expected within the next six months. Can't really speak to the outcome of that. And then just a couple of weeks ago WECC, Western Electricity Coordinating Council, initiated one of their audits. Brian and our Vice President for Transmission, Mike Cashell and I all participated in the kick-off with our WECC audit team. We consider those to be constructive and important processes and we're looking forward to the results there. And now moving on to the capital plan. As Crystal mentioned, we will be updating our plans and discussing that with you at EEI. But as is reflected here, we currently have a $2.1 billion overall capital plan over the next five years, which we expect to finance with cash flows from operations, first mortgage bonds and equity issuances. Then as always financing plans are subject to change. Two important highlights to this current plan. First of all, the plan, as depicted here, does include about $60 million for 30 to 40 megawatt flexible generating plant near Aberdeen. And we decided to discontinue our plans there as a result of significant increases in estimated construction costs and the overall supply chain challenges. We will, obviously, continue to monitor our customers' needs in South Dakota and make appropriate decisions to address those. On the other hand, these projections do not include about $275 million of anticipated investment in the 175 megawatt generation facility to be constructed near Laurel. So this overall level of capital is anticipated to result in an annualized rate base growth of 4% to 5%. And with the acceleration of the Laurel project and the discontinuation of the Aberdeen project, we anticipate -- we do anticipate providing an update at EEI coming up in just a few weeks. And I'll now turn it over to Chief Operating Officer, Brian Bird for an update on the generation portfolio and also to report our progress on ESG matters. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Bob. As Bob pointed out, obviously we withdrew our filing associated with the Laurel project, but we are certainly moving ahead with the project. In fact, we want to take advantage of the fixed price contract and protect our customers from rising costs that everyone is seeing and also to get moving as quickly as we can on the project in case unforeseen supply chain issues arise. In addition to that the Beartooth Battery contract, since the time period to build that facility is much, much shorter than the Laurel plant, we do plan to bring that in front of the Commission as a stand-alone pre-approval filing and, in fact, we plan to file that relatively soon. In addition to that, the Powerex contract which will actually go in effects in early 2022 will be available to provide protection to our customers coming up in the coming winter season. In regards to South Dakota, we are in construction of a 16 [Phonetic] megawatt plant and it's going relatively well. With COVID and some other supply chain issues, it has been pushed out to early '22. But we're excited about seeing that come online here relatively soon. As we pointed out, as Bob pointed out, in terms of the Aberdeen plant, we looked at the rising costs. We did not have an opportunity to lock in prices associated to that project. We are still in the development phase and we are negotiating those prices. But it was -- we saw those prices go up. We picked the prudent [Phonetic] thing and talked with the South Dakota Commission and talked about the expected increase in the price of that project and collectively agreed with folks we discussed the matter, decided to put a hold to the project and come back at what we hope is a more reasonable pricing and then possibly with different alternatives sometime down the road. Moving on to ESG. I guess I would say, one of the big advantages of being a member of NASDAQ is they have [Indecipherable] services, one of which is OneReport. It's a tool that we can track all of our ESG-related information. We've certainly used that tool in the first half of the year, recorded everything that we can capture today and loaded it into one report. We've now disseminated that information to those folks that rate us from an ESG perspective and we also dovetailed that into the release of our brand new web page, which is -- you will see that ESG is very, very prominent in that. We're already seeing some improvement in some of our scores and we expect to see a bit more as people continue their process of looking at our information. And with that, I'll send it back to Bob. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Okay. And with that we are ready for your questions. Questions and Answers: Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Thank you, Bob and team. [Operator Instructions] Looks like we have our first question in the queue from Ryan Greenwald of BofA. Ryan? Ryan, is your line unmuted? Ryan Greenwald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hey. Can you hear me? Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Yeah. Now we can. Ryan Greenwald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Awesome. Appreciate the time. Good afternoon, everyone. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Hey, Ryan. Ryan Greenwald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Can you talk a bit about latest conversations with the rating agencies following withdrawal of the pre-approval application and the PCAM order out of the Commission? I know it sounds like we're going to get some more information at EEI here. But anything preliminary you can say just in terms of potential equity needs end of '22 and the initial thoughts around timing and cadence, whether it'd be a block or another ATM? Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer Ryan, Crystal here. Thanks for the question. First, I'll take the first part of your questions. We did speak with each of the rating agencies as we made the decision to move forward with the Laurel project and the importance of that given, as Brian alluded to, having fixed price contracts on the table, being able to progress quickly and be able to execute on that from a customer perspective. I think the ratings agencies understand the perspective of that side of it moving forward from a business side of it. We also understand the other piece of that is you're looking for us to get recovery on rates and that'll be chief of mind for us as to how we progress with the Montana Commission and work together to accomplish that. With -- your question with regard to '22, happy to talk about that at EEI and looking forward to it. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer One footnote on the ratings agencies. Just a couple of weeks ago Moody's did an excellent presentation to the Montana Commission laying the foundation for what the ratings agencies do, how they look specifically utilities and then how they evaluate NorthWestern Energy. That was really well received by the Commission. Lot of good discussion. It's the presentation. At least the video is available online. South Dakota Commission is very interested in having a similar presentation. Of course, our view is the more our regulators understand the better for all. Ryan Greenwald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Understood. Thank you. And then can you help quantify the magnitude of inflationary pressures you guys saw with Aberdeen before opting not to move forward with the project? Was the balance sheet a limiting factor at all or was -- were the concerns really just oriented around elevated rates with the higher costs? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer No, I think we were seeing prices upwards of 50% higher than we originally seen and that's why based upon that news that we thought it made sense to sit down and chat and collectively made a good decision we believe. The balance sheet, certainly -- obviously we want to invest much capital as we need, but that was not the factor as to why we decided not to move forward. Ryan Greenwald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Understood. Thank you. And then maybe just lastly, I know you alluded earlier in terms of the fixed costs for Laurel here. But is there anything that's open in terms of that contract in terms of the $275 million that could be subject to price movement? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Not that I can think of, Ryan. Ryan Greenwald -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Ryan. Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer We'll take our next call from Jamieson or as his friends call him, James Ward from Guggenheim. James? James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst You guys have tripled the mute, I think here. Can you hear me now? Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Now, I can. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Perfect. I had -- I dialed star, 6, I hit the unmute button on the screen. And then another one popped up in the bottom corner. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer It's like three-factor authentication, I guess. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst I love it. It's extra -- cyber security is a big -- Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer We had an extra layer of security for equity analysts. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst I love it. What I was saying there to Travis' comment, I said, well, I count you among those front. So feel free to call me as you wish. So the question on Aberdeen was already asked and answered, 50% higher is very clear. 2022 EPS guidance. I understand capex and presumably, how you're going to finance that in some way, shape or form will be part of the discussion at EEI. Will 2022 EPS guidance come at the same time or will that come later? Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer Absolutely. We will be talking about both '22 EPS guidance along with capital plans. Obviously with things shifting with both Laurel accelerating and Aberdeen moving, we'll be updating capital, EPS and all financing plans. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Beautiful. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer So you've got to be there. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Well, certainly will be. The final question that I have is on Laurel, you mentioned in the release that toward the end of last week there was an unfortunately other lawsuit filed and mentioned the potential for that to delay construction. How should we think about the timing on when you could start construction, how this could impact? Well, maybe I'll just start at there. How good this is about [Phonetic] timing and then start date, end date, financing etc.? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer I will say a couple of things and turn it over to our COO. Obviously we were disappointed by the litigation. It seem to be untimely in terms of the administrative process followed. We were encouraged to hear today from the Governor that we will be side-by-side with the department in defending the lawsuit. But obviously this is Monday. We received that just several days ago. So our legal team is evaluating. Brian? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. What I would add is the biggest time factor at this point in time is getting the engines manufactured and from a site preparation standpoint and permitting, there are certain things that we're working on. We'll continue to work on that during this process. But it's the -- and that will take time and so I think there'll be on a time that can transpire, if you will, the lawsuit that we can be working at some other things. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Got you. Well, it sounds like you've got some good allies there, which is very nice to hear. The last question would be just on those, the construction of those engines. Where would that be taking place. Some RICE units are European in origin, others -- rather than just assuming and figure out I'd just ask the question. Where would -- Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer We have had engines in the past for PGGS, so produced in Germany and shipped and we'll be doing the same here for Laurel. James Ward -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst Beautiful. Thank you very much, guys. Look forward to seeing you at EEI. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Thanks, James. We'll take our next question from the line of Jonathon Reeder at Wells Fargo. Jonathan? Don't forget the triple unmute. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst All right. Can you hear me now? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Yeah. Sure, can, Jonathan. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst Yeah, it takes a while for that unmute button pop-ups. So apologies for that. Just kind of piggybacking on that last question, just to be clear, you've given, I guess, the contractors for Laurel the notice to proceed then, right, where we're definitely moving forward. It's not that you intend to do it before sometime in the future when you have to execute on the fixed price. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer We are on the final stages on final notice to proceed. I'll leave it at that. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst And then another front around the capex refresh, but it sounds like despite this environmental lawsuit, you are going to be rolling that Laurel plant then into the forecast. Even though I guess that has the potential to derail it. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Absolutely. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst Okay. Is it safe to assume these global supply chains and inflationary pressures are also impacting kind of the base capex budget, thus if you want to accomplish the same amount of work as contemplated in the current budget, it might cost more to do so? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah, it's a good question. Matter of fact, a question that was raised by the Board yesterday when we got the capital budget approved. I would say in two ways. At the time of capital budgets put together in July and we considered increasing cost from an inflationary standpoint, but I'd argue that since July even, we're seeing a bit more change there. So it's something that we certainly want to keep our eyes on. I think what might be an offsetting factor to some increased cost is concerns about -- supply chain concerns about other things that could slow construction too. So we kind of felt that we probably will end up about where we planned initially. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst You're saying where you planned initially from a dollar perspective, but not necessarily -- Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer From a dollar perspective. From a dollar perspective. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst Okay. Okay. And then, I guess in terms of though like getting certain amount of work actually done going forward, you'll have to look at what it's going to cost to get that done balanced out against your, I guess, expected rate impacts and figure out what the sweet spot is there? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Correct. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst Okay. And then [Speech Overlap] -- Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer The other comment on supply chain is the Board management is paying a lot of attention to supply chain issues, both sides cost and availability, as is the entire industry. And we're participating in the industry effort to manage through this. Certainly the challenges don't same transitory in the sense that they will evaporate in a period of weeks or months. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. And again just to be a bit more clear from my perspective, obviously the supply chain issues and other issues that could cause work to slow things could -- I don't think it's an essence of cutting projects as much as pushing projects out into the future. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst Got you. Well, that makes sense. And then actually I'm trying to think -- I had a follow-up on that and I lost my train of thought. Just two kind of housekeeping items. The $2.7 million pre-tax reversal of the previously written offline collectible accounts, was that anticipated in the '21 guidance or was that kind of an upside surprise? Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer I would say that was within line with our expectations. Jonathon Reeder -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- Analyst Okay. All right. Well, thanks. I'll leave it there. Appreciate the time. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Thanks, Jonathan. And with that we -- I think our Monday morning call has -- no we did just have one come into the queue here. It is the last four digits 3425. Eric Peterson -- Millennium Management -- Analyst Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Yes, we can. Who do we have? Eric Peterson -- Millennium Management -- Analyst Hey. This is Eric Peterson from Millennium. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Hey, Eric. Eric Peterson -- Millennium Management -- Analyst I appreciate you taking my question. Hey. Just real quick on the project up in Aberdeen. Can you give us any flavor on whether the capacity need will still be there in the next iteration of the IRP next year? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Absolutely. Eric Peterson -- Millennium Management -- Analyst And then part two -- oh, go ahead. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah, I think -- I'm sorry, I didn't interrupt -- if you had a further question, I'll pause and let's keep going. Eric Peterson -- Millennium Management -- Analyst Okay. Yeah, just separately, was that charge-off adjusted out in your non-GAAP earnings this quarter? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer No, I'll let the CFO answer that question. I'll take the first question. I think the capacity need still exists in South Dakota. I think we just want -- we will continue to manage that and these other means to close that gap in the short term, but continue to evaluate what we want to do longer term there. And again, understanding what pricing has done, in the future come back at some point in time in the next IRP and make a decision there. Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer And, Eric, this is Crystal. The second part of your question is, was the charge-off that's related to those initial cost at Aberdeen non-GAAP-ed out. It was not. It is in our earnings. Eric Peterson -- Millennium Management -- Analyst Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys, very much. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Thanks, Eric. It looks like we have one more question in the queue that we're trying to get through here. We'll see if this works. It's from the line of Matt Davis, I believe. Matt, we just allowed you to speak. If you -- Matthew Davis -- Coann Capital -- Analyst Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Yeah, we can. [Phonetic] Matthew Davis -- Coann Capital -- Analyst So I just had a question on the Aberdeen project. I mean, I understand that pricing has gone up roughly 50%. But what -- based on what you're seeing in the energy market as well as in the capacity market in your region with the extreme cost as well as, I believe the project was expected to come online sometime in 2024. So a little bit later in the the planning horizon, why go ahead and make that decision now? And how do you -- and is this -- the 50% increase in the project cost enough to kind of outweigh what you're seeing in the energy and capacity markets? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. I think the main thing was when you sit down with the Commission and tell you want to give them a heads up that if we move forward this project at this point in time this is what we expect to see and we talked about alternatives and then we collectively agreed it probably makes sense to wait. And we had asked if there is certain other things we can do in the short term, we did say we had alternatives and we would collectively look at that in the next IRP. If you might remember, we initially -- Aberdeen was something it didn't necessarily contemplate in the first IRP, but we thought from an expeditious standpoint we could forge ahead with that and we were certainly planning to head that direction. But again, the dialog we have with the Commission, it just was a collective decision to not move forward. Matthew Davis -- Coann Capital -- Analyst And then just one other one. In terms of thinking about the moving pieces around the capital program, I get that your base plan probably has some inflationary measures. But is it just as simply as thinking about at putting in Laurel and subtracting out Aberdeen or are there other pieces to the puzzle? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer We'll be discussing the updated capital plan in great detail at EEI. Honestly, excited about the good and important work ahead of us. So it's not a simple matter of trading out one for one. Matthew Davis -- Coann Capital -- Analyst Okay. Thank you. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Matt. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Thanks, Matt. It looks like we have one more question in the queue from Andy Levi. Andy we're opening your line. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Unmute. Okay, does that work? Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer That works. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Oh, look at that. See, I am the old guy and I can figure it out quicker than the other guys. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer You're technologically adept. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Yeah, I can push a button. How are you guys are doing? All right, everything good? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Very good. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Everything good. Yes, OK, good. Okay. So just two questions. First just on natural gas in general. If I remember it correctly, right, you guys made several acquisitions on the natural gas side as far as resources. Is that correct? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Correct. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst And are those still flowing gas? Are those still flowing gas? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Okay. And so could you just -- I have a couple of questions around that. But could you kind of just explain how significant that is as far as helping you this winter on supply and I mean that price wise? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer I'll say a couple of things and turn it over to, again, Brian, our COO. In Montana, in particular, think about the integrated system that does have some owned supply that has a lot of storage and transmission and storage at both ends of the system. So that gives us flexibility in terms of bringing gas in several points on the system, storing -- purchasing and storing gas in the off-season when prices are relatively more attractive than moving the gas around the system. So that puts us in, I think, a much better position than if we were simply a local delivery system. So that's a real positive. Brian? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yeah. I would say two things. First of all, we thought that buying gas reserves made sense. Some rules were changed at the Commission that made difficult for us to do more of that. We would like to have done more particularly for events like this with higher prices. But I would say, about 10% to 15% of that purchase gas is available to us at this point in time and the nice thing Bob mentioned, stores that we have in our system. We're able to use that storage and fill it up and save it for peak periods in the winter season and that provides about 50% of the gas that we use. So we certainly -- that's a nice advantage of our system. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst When you say 10% to 15% that's your total supply, not what you're using from the reserves that you have, is that correct? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Total supply -- total supply, Andy. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Right. Okay. And how -- I know it's been a while since we discussed this, what do you have as far as reserves, like what's the total amount that you have or that you actually produce on an annual basis? Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Andy, years ago we used to have those slides in our deck and we're talking about [Speech Overlap] -- Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst I know. Okay. Okay, so -- OK. So that's fine. You don't have it right now. That's fine. We can discuss at EEI. And then I've like a bigger picture question about that. I understand it's a rate base type of product -- project -- product. Okay. At the same time you need equity and obviously equity affects our rates and affects the customer as well. Are there any thoughts again that's kind of paying its dividends this year, but also the price of gas has gone up so dramatically and the price for assets has gone up so dramatically that have you ever thought of monetizing those assets in lieu of doing equity? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer That would be a no. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Okay, fair enough. Stuff that pops in my head. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer No, it's good. We always appreciate your ideas. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Okay. Well, some people do. I don't know about my family for that. It depends on the family member. And then the last question -- Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer No one is a hero at home. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst That's true. And then the last question I have is just again around the amount of equity that you need, not the actual dollar amount but just again you're thinking on -- because I truly believe that the ATM has affected your stock price on a relative basis. And so any thoughts kind of around that versus just someone like myself or other people just kind of buying the shares from you all at once and then taking that pressure off the stock since it doesn't trade that much volume, same question I ask to you every quarter. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Crystal? Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer Andy, we appreciate your resounding interest in our stock. We think it's a good holding through. We hear you on that. The comments on technical execution would be the only thing I have to say about that. We hear you. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer I'll help you out, Andy, on your previous question. You asked the amount of Bcf. And if my math serves me kind of in that 10% to 15%, I'd argue it's about 3 Bcf. Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Okay. That's great, guys. I see -- Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer [Indecipherable] Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Okay. I see you guys soon in Florida. Look forward to seeing you in person. Can you hear me? Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer Yes. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thank you. [Speech Overlap] Andrew Levi -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Okay. See you, guys. Thank you. Bye. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Looks like we have another call coming in from the line of Paul Patterson [Phonetic]. Paul, we're opening up your line now. Paul Patterson -- Analyst Yeah. Can you hear me? Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Yeah. Paul Patterson -- Analyst Okay. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we lost you now. Paul Patterson -- Analyst Can you hear me? Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Barely. Paul Patterson -- Analyst I'll send you a text. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer Yes. We can hear you now. Crystal D. Lail -- Vice President And Chief Financial Officer We can hear you. Paul Patterson -- Analyst Okay. My question is basically with the Aberdeen increase of 50% it sounds a little like hyperinflation. Was there any specific driver or drivers or can you just give a little more color on? I apologize, I missed it. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer No, I didn't give any specific drivers. Thinking about the total cost it wasn't just one particular component. But from a total cost perspective, it was upwards of 50% increase, all in. Paul Patterson -- Analyst Okay. Okay. So it's just everything just pretty much came together. Is that it? This seems so big. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Yep, it does. Paul Patterson -- Analyst Okay. Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Brian B. Bird -- President and Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Paul. Travis Meyer -- Director of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations Officer All right. With that, I think we have now exhausted our queue. I'll hand it back to Bob for close. Robert C. Rowe -- Chief Executive Officer Okay. Thank you all for your interest and a very good discussion and the theme here is we're all going to have lots to talk about at EEI. So looking forward to seeing most of you, many of you in person and some of you probably online. Take care and be safe. Duration: 29 minutes Call participants: Crystal D.

Amkor Technology, inc ( NASDAQ:AMKR ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 5:00 p.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Amkor Technology Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hilary and I will be your conference facilitator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jennifer Jue, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Jue, Please go ahead. Jennifer Jue -- Senior Director, Investor Relations and Finance Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Amkor's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Giel Rutten, our Chief Executive Officer; and Megan Faust, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings press release was filed with the SEC this afternoon and is available on the Investor Relations page of our website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. During this presentation, we will use non-GAAP financial measures and you can find the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP equivalent on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about our expectations for Amkor's future performance based on the environment as we currently see it. Of course, actual results could differ. Please refer to our press release and other SEC filings for information on risk factors, uncertainties and exceptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations. Please note that the financial results discussed today are preliminary and final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Giel. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We delivered outstanding financial results in the third quarter with record revenue of $1.68 billion and record profitability. Strong execution, high factory utilization and controlled spending resulted in record quarterly EPS of $0.74. When combined with a strong first half results, we generated $1.74 of EPS in the first three quarters, doubling last year performance in the same period. Revenue was up 24% year-on-year and 20% sequential growth comes on top of an excellent second quarter. Continued momentum drove record performance in all end markets, most notably in communications and consumer, where we saw sequential revenue increases of 28% and 22%, respectively. Our communication business grew 24% year, on-year representing 43% of total quarterly revenue. The main driver for growth here is the strength in the smartphone market, particularly in 5G with current industry forecast of nearly 500 million 5G enabled smartphones to be built this year. We expect 5G to remain an important growth driver and we continue to invest in technology and manufacturing scale to support our customers in these growing markets. In the automotive and industrial market, we achieved another quarterly revenue record with sequential growth of 9% and year-on-year growth of 42%. The growth underlines the strong recovery in this market, although supply chain constraints, especially in wafer and substrate supply then can further growth. The strong recovery of our automotive business is mainly due to significant ramps of new products in this domain, particularly supporting the rapid proliferation of ADAS functionality and the accelerated electrification of car models. Amkor is well positioned to support these innovations with solid technology portfolio and an established automotive qualified manufacturing base. In ADAS, we are ramping the assembly of the latest generation processors using our advanced flip chip technology and the portfolio of radar and optical sensors, using wafer level fan-out technology. For electrical vehicles, we are enabling the assembly of high power silicon carbide devices in our Japan factories, utilizing unique wire bonds and leadframe technology. Although, we foresee some short-term and mid-term constraints in automotive supply chain, we believe the long-term growth drivers in this markets remain in place, resulting in the continued expansion of semiconductor content per car. Market forecasts show growth rates in the automotive market that exceeds the average semiconductor industry growth. Strength in the consumer markets resulted in a better-than-expected sequential increase of 22%. We continue to diversify our product and customer portfolio in IoT wearables and we ramped several new products in the third quarter. We expect this market to be an important driver of growth and our overall product and customer pipeline for advanced as IP solutions in this sector remains strong. Revenue in the computing market set another quarterly record with sequential growth of 9% and year-on-year growth of 28%. Further, our site [Phonetic] was tempered by constraints in material supply, especially high-end substrate materials. During the quarter we experienced solid performance in all computing applications and a further strengthening of our project pipeline. We continue to invest in technology and manufacturing scale to capitalize on opportunities in emerging segments, like AI and high-performance computing. Finally, our test business grew 19% year-on-year in the third quarter to a record $225 million, as we broadened the scope of our test services for 5G communications and system level testing. Our manufacturing organization did an excellent job managing the steep production ramp in the third quarter, most notably for advanced packaging in our factories in Korea. During the quarter, we added capacity and ramped several new products while working through obstacles in the supply chain caused by COVID restrictions and supply constraints for material and equipment. We worked closely with our suppliers and customers and managed to keep the impact limited, although we experienced some revenue impact for our SiP business due to short supply of critical ICs. We expect the constraints in material and equipment supply to continue into next year. To mitigate risk, we have expanded agreements with several of our suppliers as well as most of our top customers to warrant the better supply assurance in future periods. In the U.S., we continue to monitor investment policies to incentivize domestic semiconductor manufacturing and we are exploring a possible factory location to align with the U.S. investments of other major semiconductor companies. Our capex target for the year remains at $775 million with major investments for wafer level and flip chip technology, SiP and test capacity, as well as facility expansions. Now, let me turn to our fourth quarter outlook. We are expecting the fourth quarter to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.64 billion at the midpoint of our guidance. This represents a year-on-year increase of 20% for both the quarter and the full year. For 2021, we expect double-digit percentage growth in all end markets and we remain confident in our strong market position and the overall demand environment. Megan will now provide more detailed financial information. Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Giel, and good afternoon, everyone. Amkor delivered strong financial results in Q3, setting new records for revenue, gross profit, operating income, EPS and EBITDA. Third quarter revenue of $1.68 billion was up $274 million or 20% from the second quarter. And as Giel noted, all of our end market set new revenue records. During the quarter, we successfully navigated through several disruptions in the supply chain, specifically material constraints for wafers, substrates and components. These disruptions primarily impacted the communications end market, where our growth was hindered, but still in line with historical seasonality. This was partially offset by upsides in our consumer advanced SiP portfolio for IoT wearable products. Revenue for advanced products grew 26% sequentially and represents around 70% of our business. This significant growth is driven by new product introductions, primarily in advanced SiP, supporting the communications and consumer end markets. Our revenue from mainstream products grew 4% sequentially and 27% year-on-year, principally due to recovery in the automotive market. With high levels of utilization, gross margin expanded 150 basis points year-on-year to 19.3% and our gross profit of $325 million is an all-time record. Operating expenses for the quarter came in as expected at $113 million. Our focus on controlling opex during a period of significant growth contributed to record operating income of $211 million. Operating income margin expanded 160 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. Net income for the quarter was $181 million, resulting in an all-time record EPS of $0.74. We generated record EBITDA of $358 million in Q3, and EBITDA margin was 21.3%. Shifting to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $790 million of cash and short-term investments and total liquidity of $1.2 billion. At September 30, total debt was approximately $1 billion and our debt to EBITDA ratio is 0.8 times, well below our target of 1.5 times. With respect to our capital allocation policy, we will reinvest in the business supporting technology and capability advancements and R&D, as well as capacity expansion for organic growth. This may be equipment as well as facilities expansion when needed. Target capital intensity in the low teens and efficient utilization enables profitable growth. We will continue to optimize our debt structure with respect to amount, cost and duration. We have reduced our interest expense by over 20% or $11 million for the nine months ended September 30 compared to the same period in the prior year. We also have access to reserve liquidity for unforeseen events or opportunity. As it relates to strategic investments, we target technology enhancements adjacent to our core competencies and geographic diversification supporting our customers' supply chain needs, for example, in the U.S. or other locations that are developing a semiconductor supply chain. Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority, and we expect to grow the dividend over time. Our solid financial position provides flexibility to achieve these priorities. Moving on to our fourth quarter outlook. We expect continued strength in the market with revenue to be between $1.59 billion and $1.69 billion. Considering the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, 2021 revenue growth is estimated to be around 20% over prior year. Gross margin is expected to be similar to Q3 between 18% and 20.5%. We expect to maintain operating expenses at around $115 million. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be around 15% due to discrete tax benefits and favorable foreign currency movement. Q4 net income is expected to be between $140 million and $190 million, resulting in EPS of $0.55 to $0.75. Our forecast for capital expenditures for the full year remains at $775 million for a capital intensity in the low teens. With that, we will now open the call up for your questions. Operator? Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Randy Abrams of Credit Suisse. Please state your... Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay. Yes, thank you. Good evening. And good job on results, especially factoring the supply constraints. I wanted to ask on the fourth quarter guidance. We're at the midpoint. It's a small revenue decline, but could you elaborate? Some years, I think, it's flat plus or minus. For fourth quarter, how much of that is a supply constraint impacting sales versus -- I'm curious if you're also seeing any areas of push-out due to customers also facing some mismatch shipping product. So if you could elaborate a bit on the sequential decline granted off a high base in the third quarter? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Randy. This is Giel. Let me here try to give you a first flavor of Q4 guidance. Fourth quarter for Amkor generally is a little bit up or down. It can be up a few percent or down a few percent. The guidance is currently 2% down. Mostly, we see correction in the communication market, where we see still some constraints in components, specifically also critical ICs. I don't see a correction, as you mentioned in the end market, where, let's say, end customers correcting their build plans based on imbalance in the supply chain. So to me, it's still a continuation of the third quarter with limited supply of specific ICs. Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay. And if you could elaborate on constraints, you talked about a couple in the remarks, but auto, the constraints you're seeing and whether -- and if you could give a look at how you see the constraints evolving? So I think auto was one area, high-end substrate was an area. And if you could elaborate more on the constraints in ICs. Are these mostly small IC like power management or is across different ICs? So yeah, if you could elaborate a bit on the constraint and how you see it continuing looking forward, as we go into next year? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Okay. No, the way that we see and experience constraints is slightly different in each market segment. If you take for example, the automotive market, we observed the constraints in the beginning of the year was mostly wafer constraints. Later on in this year, Q3, Q4 and also into next year, we see constraints continuing, but then shifting more on the substrate side, specifically the higher-end substrates in automotive applications like ADAS, which is generally designs and advanced silicon notes. We here observe constraints staff and the basis is the same for the computing market. Now, on the communication markets, however, we see multiple different dynamics. There we see for our SiP business, a continued shortage of specific components or ICs and as you already mentioned, these are ICs which are, let's say, smaller ICs, generally designs in the share more mature nodes and that we see here continue in the fourth quarter. Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay. And if you can give an initial view, I mean you mentioned it's mostly supply side, not demand side. Is there an initial view? Well, I'm sure we'll get more detail in a few months, but for first quarter, how it's looking at? If looks like factoring the supply demand, you could see above seasonal first quarter? And then how you're viewing next year in terms of the overall environment? If you're expecting good year, still supply constrained year or and I'm curious on the risk side. If you see any areas where inventories building up like components that are more available, but needing to slow that down. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, we don't guide for, let's say, the first quarter next year or even beyond that, Randy, but on the inventory and supply situation, there is some short-term inventory buildup because of some of the components constraints and that's would result in some build of inventory of other components. Although, I would view as that that's still a small effect in the overall supply chain. We also see end customers being less conservative on holding more inventory. So we expect that based on their risk management, overall inventories during the year will continue to increase. And on the supply side, on the wafer supply side, I believe that there the constraint will ease in the first half of the year. On the substrate supply side, it may take a little bit longer. I mean significant investments for substrates supply, let's say capacity increases. But that will, in my view, only come on stream toward the fourth quarter of next year. So in short, I mean, I don't see significant inventory up and some of these constraints will ease a little bit in the second quarter and some of them will continue till the fourth quarter next year. Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay, sir. Thank you. And one last question I'll ask for the -- I'm curious if SiP business driver, if it's -- I think traditionally our consumer stick with audio. If that's still a big driver or if you could give a profile that set like how much now, it looks like it's growing this year? And the profile, if you could talk a bit more about this pipeline and how it looks for continuing to grow the SiP opportunities? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, our SiP opportunities now in the third quarter, we saw significant strength in SiP. On the communication side, it was slightly moderated because of the supply side constraints that I mentioned before. On the consumer side, it was strong. Although also there, we see some constraint. But it's -- we have significant strength on the consumer side. We believe that to continue. We see also a diversification on the product side, both on the communication as well as on the consumer side. And SiP, more broadly, is also entering applications like automotive, where we have strength specifically on the digital, let's say, dashboard side. So, multiple applications, strong product pipeline and in our view, it's a growth engine going forward. Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Actually an outfit [Phonetic], like maybe one more just on the margin implication. If it looks like from a capacity perspective, you're running near full. With the gross margin now kind of where you're operating at this level, fairly high, 19%, 20%, is that viewed as kind of a -- that high point, or you could say like up cycle margin, business remains healthy or is there a room like if we have a good year for some further margin leverage? Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hi, Randy, I will... Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer [Indecipherable] to the make a point. Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I can take that, Randy. So with respect to gross margins being at 19%, 20%, while we're operating at high utilization, we do have still some capacity, specifically, in our Japan location. So there is some upside there. And then the only other comment I would make is one of the other variables besides utilization that does impact gross margin percentage is product mix, so with respect to that mix of products that can have an impact on gross margin percentage, where we would have, could have some upside as well. Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay, all right, great, thanks. Thanks Megan and Giel. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Art Winston of Pilot Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst Thank you for the really great results and the great outlook. I have two questions. The first one is, given the very sharp increase in material costs, what about the possibility of raising selling prices to offset these sharp increases in the materials? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, let me answer that. We mentioned it also earlier on in previous calls. The general arrangements that we have with our customers is that cost increases on the material side are factored in the prices to our customers. So if our material cost is increasing, specifically for substrates what we're seeing now and also other materials, then we factor that in into adjustments to pricing to our customers. Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst It's factored in? Okay. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer No, no. It will be factored in if it continues to go up, prices to customers will also go up. Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst Will be, OK, good. Megan touched on the last minute. Other than in Japan, is the utilization rate pretty much high across every place else, except perhaps in Japan? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah... Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Go ahead, Giel. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I mean, third quarter, fourth quarter, for Amkor, our peak quarters, there were some areas that are still some on the utilization. Meg already mentioned that in Japan. But overall, we have a very strong utilization across our factories. Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst Good. And my last question is in terms of the automotive, if the supply congestion were to ease, should we assume that your automotive shipments will be sharply higher correlating with the increased amount of car builds across the world? Would that happen? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, in the quarter, in Q3, we saw... Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst No, I'm talking probably about going forward, not in quarter [Phonetic]. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Going forward? Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst Yes, yes. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think in my view, but still not at the peak of our automotive business, if you take for example applications like ADAS or digital dashboards or INCA [Phonetic] networking, is still in the early beginning. So it's not only car volumes, but it's also the attach rate of these advanced functions into the car, and what we believe is that there is an acceleration in the car markets for two elements. First is ADAS, but also electrification of the cars is increasing, much steeper curves than what was expected two years ago. So it will continue to increase. And as mentioned, we believe that the semiconductor content per car and the overall semiconductor market and automotive is growing faster than the average semiconductor growth rate. Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst We could assume that the product mix with more profitable for the more advanced and complex electrification products that you're making going forward, it will be more profitable? Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, we have pockets that are more profitable than others, but that will be a correct assumption. Art Winston -- Pilot Advisors -- Analyst Okay. Okay, thank you for everything. Operator Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Vijay, are you there. Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho -- Analyst Yeah, sorry, I was on mute. Hi, Giel and Megan. I was wondering on the auto industrial side, what's your split within that of auto industrial and when you look at auto side, and you mentioned ADAS and electrification. Just wondering how -- what percent of your automotive was geared to ADAS and EV? Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So Vijay, we don't break out auto, and industrial separate. However, the majority of that market is automotive. And then with respect to your second question, it was specifically asking about the concentration of ADAS in our automotive. Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho -- Analyst Yeah, it's definitely. Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So we don't breakout ADAS, EV. We also have a significant amount of infotainment in automotive and then as a reminder, all of that traditional and mainstream business is an automotive. We are seeing significant increase in the advanced portion of automotive, but we don't break out those segments separately. This quarter we did see an increase in ADAS from the prior quarter as well as in electrification. Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho -- Analyst Got it. And as I look at Q4, December quarter, in terms of mildly, mildly softer 2% down, I guess. How would you look at auto industrial and the comm side into Q4? I know you mentioned comm had some, I guess, constraints, but how would you look at auto, industrial and the comp side trending into Q4? Thanks. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Megan, do you want to comment on this? Megan Faust -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah. So automotive, we're seeing more flattish in Q4, so continued strength despite the supply chain constraint and communications is where we are seeing a decline in Q4 and as Giel mentioned previously, that we are seeing continued shortages in specific IC components and it is fairly historically seasonal to see a downtick in communications in Q4, given the timing of the different phone launch cycles. Vijay Rakesh -- Mizuho -- Analyst Got it, thanks. Thanks so much. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Vijay. Operator At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Giel for closing remarks. Giel Rutten -- President and Chief Executive Officer Okay, thank you. Well, before closing the call, I would like to recap our key messages. For the third quarter of 2021, we delivered all-time record revenue of $1.68 billion and record EPS of $0.74. For the fourth quarter, we expect robust year-on-year growth of 20% with revenue of $1.64 billion. Supply chain constraints of substrates and components are expected to continue into Q4 and into the next year. We expect a gradual recovery in the second half of next year when new capacity comes online. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate risks from these ongoing constraints. The main catalyst for future growth, our 5G, IoT, automotive and high-performance computing and Amkor is well positioned in these key markets. Last but not least, I would like to thank the global Amkor team for delivering this record quarter. Thank you for joining the call today.

    "content": "Payments giant Mastercard has partnered with a cryptocurrency exchange to allow its partners and merchants in the U.S. to offer crypto solutions, including the buying, selling, and holding of cryptocurrencies. “We want to offer all of our partners the ability to more easily add crypto services to whatever it is they’re doing.” Mastercard’s Network Integrates Crypto Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and cryptocurrency exchange platform Bakkt (NYSE: BKKT) announced “a multifaceted partnership” Monday at the Money20/20 event. The partnership aims “to make it easier for merchants, banks, and fintechs in the U.S. to embrace and offer a broad set of cryptocurrency solutions and services,” the announcement details. “Bakkt extends Mastercard’s ecosystem of cryptocurrency partners enabling crypto-as-a-service, which provides quick access to cryptocurrency capabilities.” The two companies explained: Mastercard partners will be able to offer cryptocurrency solutions. These include the ability for consumers to buy, sell and hold digital assets through custodial wallets powered by the Bakkt platform and streamlined issuance of branded crypto debit and credit cards. The payments giant has relationships with more than 20,000 financial institutions worldwide, and there are 2.8 billion Mastercards in use, according to the company. An October 2019 Nilson Report states that Visa and Mastercard both had 52.9 million merchants — more than any other companies worldwide. Mastercard further revealed that crypto will also be integrated into its loyalty solutions, allowing its partners to “offer cryptocurrency as rewards and create fungibility between loyalty points and other digital assets.” The announcement adds: This means that consumers can earn and spend rewards in cryptocurrency instead of traditional loyalty points and seamlessly convert their crypto holdings to pay for purchases.

The partnership aims “to make it easier for merchants, banks, and fintechs in the U.S. to embrace and offer a broad set of cryptocurrency solutions and services,” the announcement details. “Bakkt extends Mastercard’s ecosystem of cryptocurrency partners enabling crypto-as-a-service, which provides quick access to cryptocurrency capabilities.” The two companies explained: Mastercard partners will be able to offer cryptocurrency solutions. These include the ability for consumers to buy, sell and hold digital assets through custodial wallets powered by the Bakkt platform and streamlined issuance of branded crypto debit and credit cards. The payments giant has relationships with more than 20,000 financial institutions worldwide, and there are 2.8 billion Mastercards in use, according to the company. An October 2019 Nilson Report states that Visa and Mastercard both had 52.9 million merchants — more than any other companies worldwide. Mastercard further revealed that crypto will also be integrated into its loyalty solutions, allowing its partners to “offer cryptocurrency as rewards and create fungibility between loyalty points and other digital assets.” The announcement adds: This means that consumers can earn and spend rewards in cryptocurrency instead of traditional loyalty points and seamlessly convert their crypto holdings to pay for purchases.

[+] game against the Utah Jazz at Vivint Smart Home Arena on October 20, 2021 in Salt Lake City, Utah. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Alex Goodlett/Getty Images) Getty Images “You can’t build a team the same way in every city,” said Thunder GM Sam Presti in a press conference before the start of the 2021-22 season. In a small market like Oklahoma City, rebuilding a team can look different. The Thunder are in a unique situation in which they only have one real option to get back to contention. The three main mechanisms for NBA franchises to build a roster are the draft, trades and free agency. Free agency isn’t an option for the Thunder. Looking at their history in signing top talent, it’s non-existent. The top players in the NBA have continuously shown a desire to play in large markets, stacking talent and building super teams. Just look at the top free agents over the past few years and where they’ve signed. Small markets simply don’t have the luxury of signing top-tier talent. From there, trading for players can be beneficial, but there are certainly caveats. The Thunder have shown a willingness to trade for top talent in the past. However, typically when you trade for players that make a real impact on a championship ceiling, it’s when they’re entering their thirties and the final year or two of their deal. Take Paul George, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul for example. All were excellent players and absolutely worth trading for, but had the chance to be just a rental. With how often players force their way into a trade, player mobility is at an all-time high. It’s rare for a player to be on the same team for more than just a handful of years in the modern NBA.

They’re in it for the long game, and are looking for talent they can retain for many years. This leaves drafting prospects as the only option for a team like the Thunder. Luckily for them, they have the most draft capital of any team in NBA history over the next five years. A top pick isn’t ever a guarantee that you’re going to get a player that blossoms into a superstar. However, history tells us that the higher the pick, the higher the probability of landing a franchise-altering player. NBA Draft Pick Analysis Daniel Weinberg of Medium Since there’s never a guarantee of drafting this type of player with a top pick, it makes sense for teams to get the most chances they possibly can. Every team needs a little bit of luck along the way in a successful rebuild. While the draft lottery didn’t go their way last summer, it doesn’t mean it won’t going forward. Between landing a top pick in the lottery system and then drafting a player who ends up being a star, history can only tell us so much. The more bites out of the apple, the better the odds of landing a guy who can become the face of the franchise. OKC Thunder First-Round Draft Picks OKC Thunder Even if the Thunder don’t use every single one of these first-round picks, which they likely won’t, this gives them the ultimate flexibility. Additionally, they have a plethora of second rounders to leverage as well. With this much draft capital, Presti has the ability to create the most enticing package for a superstar player when the time comes. It also allows the Thunder to trade up in the draft to get a player they believe is a superstar talent in the future. Draft picks are quite literally the currency of the NBA. Drafting players is also the most sustainable way to develop talent. When a team drafts a player, they’re able to let him grow in their system. Additionally, teams are able to control these contracts for nearly a decade, which is crucial for small market teams. With that in mind, the Thunder need to be extremely patient throughout the rebuild. It’s not about rushing to make the playoffs again, it’s about building a sustainable team that’s consistently in the postseason. Presti said it best at the end of last season. “The longer you want to be good, the more patience it sometimes requires,” the Thunder GM said. On average, it takes rebuilding teams around four years to make the playoffs again. It takes roughly six years to make the playoffs in consecutive seasons. Finally, it typically takes upwards of ten years to become a championship contending team through a rebuild. There are always going to be anomalies and events that can expedite or slow down these timelines, but patience is required either way. “There’s only one thing to win in the NBA and it’s a championship,” said Presti at the end of last season.",

So what Moderna said interim data from a phase 2/3 study suggested its vaccine demonstrated \"a robust neutralizing antibody response\" in kids aged 6 to 11 after two 50-microgram doses. Critically, the drug also demonstrated \"a favorable safety profile.\" The drugmaker intends to submit the trial data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) \"in the near term.\" \"We are encouraged by the immunogenicity and safety profile of mRNA-1273 in children aged 6 to under 12 years and are pleased that the study met its primary immunogenicity endpoints,\" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a press release. \"We look forward to filing with regulators globally and remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic with a vaccine for adults and children of all ages.\" Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, Moderna announced after the market close that the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concluded that 50-microgram booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine could be administered to people aged 18 years and older six months after their second dose of the drug. \"This recommendation is supported by clinical evidence that a 50 µg booster dose induces a strong immune response against COVID-19,\" Bancel said. Now what Health officials say vaccinating children is an important step toward protecting more people from the dangers of the novel coronavirus. Booster shots could also help to provide a greater level of protection to adults, particularly those that have seen their level of immunity wane in the months after their initial two doses. Better still, by providing its potentially life-saving vaccine to more people, Moderna stands to generate more profits, which it can use to develop new drugs to combat other diseases.",

    "full_description": "Amid fallout from the Facebook Papers documents supporting claims that the social network has valued financial success over user safety, Facebook on Monday reported higher profit for the latest quarter. The company’s latest show of financial strength followed an avalanche of reports on the Facebook Papers – a vast trove of redacted internal documents obtained by a consortium of news organizations, including The Associated Press – as well as Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s Monday testimony to British lawmakers. Read more: Explainer: What are the Facebook Papers? Facebook said its net income grew 17% in the July-September period to $9.19 billion, buoyed by strong advertising revenue. That’s up from $7.85 billion a year earlier. Revenue grew 35% to $29.01 billion. The results exceeded analyst expectations for Facebook’s results. The company’s shares rose 2.5% in after-hours trading after closing up 1% for the day. Story continues below advertisement “For now, the revenue picture for Facebook looks as good as can be expected,” said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. But she predicted more revelations and described the findings so far as “unsettling and stomach-churning.” 1:54 Status update: Facebook reportedly ready to rebrand, build a metaverse Status update: Facebook reportedly ready to rebrand, build a metaverse CEO Mark Zuckerberg made only a brief mention of what he called the “recent debate around our company.” Largely repeating statements he made after Haugen’s Oct. 5 testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee, he insisted that he welcomes “good faith criticism” but considers the current storm a “coordinated effort” to paint a “false picture” of the company based on leaked documents. “It makes a good soundbite to say that we don’t solve these impossible tradeoffs because we’re just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing difficult social values,” Zuckerberg said. Read more: Facebook failed to stop global spread of abusive content, documents reveal Story continues below advertisement Haugen, meanwhile, told a British parliamentary committee Monday that the social media giant stokes online hate and extremism, fails to protect children from harmful content and lacks any incentive to fix the problems, providing momentum for efforts by European governments working on stricter regulation of tech companies. While her testimony echoed much of what she told the U.S. Senate this month, her in-person appearance drew intense interest from a British parliamentary committee that is much further along in drawing up legislation to rein in the power of social media companies. Haugen told the committee of United Kingdom lawmakers that Facebook Groups amplifies online hate, saying algorithms that prioritize engagement take people with mainstream interests and push them to the extremes. The former Facebook data scientist said the company could add moderators to prevent groups over a certain size from being used to spread extremist views. “Unquestionably, it’s making hate worse,” she said. 2:04 Whistleblower: Facebook harms children, weakens democracy Whistleblower: Facebook harms children, weakens democracy – Oct 5, 2021 Haugen said she was “shocked” to hear that Facebook wants to double down on what Zuckerberg calls “the metaverse,” the company’s plan for an immersive online world it believes will be the next big internet trend. Story continues below advertisement “They’re gonna hire 10,000 engineers in Europe to work on the metaverse,” Haugen said. “I was like, `Wow, do you know what we could have done with safety if we had 10,000 more engineers?”’ she said. Facebook says it wants regulation for tech companies and was glad the U.K. was leading the way. Read more: Facebook whistleblower says platform amplifies online hate, extremism “While we have rules against harmful content and publish regular transparency reports, we agree we need regulation for the whole industry so that businesses like ours aren’t making these decisions on our own,” Facebook said Monday. It pointed to investing $13 billion (9.4 billion pounds) on safety and security since 2016 and asserted that it’s “almost halved” the amount of hate speech over the last three quarters. Haugen accused Facebook-owned Instagram of failing to keep children under 13 _ the minimum user age _ from opening accounts, saying it wasn’t doing enough to protect kids from content that, for example, makes them feel bad about their bodies. “Facebook’s own research describes it as an addict’s narrative. Kids say, `This makes me unhappy, I feel like I don’t have the ability to control my usage of it, and I feel like if I left, I’d be ostracized,`” she said. Story continues below advertisement 4:28 Implications for Facebook after Congressional hearing Implications for Facebook after Congressional hearing – Oct 6, 2021 The company last month delayed plans for a kids’ version of Instagram, geared toward those under 13, in order to address concerns about the vulnerability of younger users. Pressed on whether she believes Facebook is fundamentally evil, Haugen demurred and said, “I can’t see into the hearts of men.” Facebook is not evil, but negligent, she suggested. It was Haugen’s second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook’s civic integrity unit. Read more: Facebook Papers are a ‘call to arms’ over pressing need to regulate: MPs The documents, which Haugen provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allege Facebook prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public. Some stories based on the files have already been published, exposing internal turmoil after Facebook was blindsided by the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and how it dithered over curbing divisive content in India. More is to come. Story continues below advertisement Representatives from Facebook and other social media companies plan to speak to the British committee Thursday. Haugen is scheduled to meet next month with European Union officials in Brussels, where the bloc’s executive commission is updating its digital rulebook to better protect internet users by holding online companies more responsible for illegal or dangerous content. Under the U.K. rules, expected to take effect next year, Silicon Valley giants face an ultimate penalty of up to 10% of their global revenue for any violations. The EU is proposing a similar penalty. © 2021 The Canadian Press",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin One of the issues that hinders the economic prospects of Black communities is a lack of access to capital so that firms can invest and grow. A basic problem many Black communities face is that lending can require an in-depth knowledge of those communities, something traditional banks often lack. More than that, it requires a tolerance for greater risk and long-term investing for banks to realize a profit in a Black community, where incomes tend to be below the national average and the opportunities for profitable investment may be fewer and not as obvious. Large commercial banks do operate in most Black communities, taking deposits and making some loans. But they have little knowledge of these communities and tend to make only the safest loans. And by gobbling up all the deposits, they end up crowding out the smaller banks that know their depositors. I was born and raised in a small, rural community, where the president of our hometown bank—a longtime friend—tells me that a similar thing happens there: While they compete against commercial banks for deposits these days, they do not compete against them to do loans. His bank’s constraint is access to capital—not profitable places in the community to invest. The same thing is true in many black communities as well, except the lack of capital is exacerbated by a lack of Black-owned banks. There are forty percent fewer banks today than there were just fifteen years ago, and today there are just 23 Black-owned banks , with a total of roughly $5 billion of deposits—a fraction of the deposits in any one of the largest commercial banks. The implication of this is that efforts to induce large banks to do more lending in minority communities—while well-intended—may not be all that effective at spurring new businesses and economic growth in these places: These banks simply don’t have the ability to discern what businesses are likely to grow and prosper. MORE FOR YOU Biden’s Proposed IRS Bank Account Snooping Authority Runs Into State Resistance 2021 Diversity Green Card Lottery Winners To Be Shut Out Because Of Visa Deadline The Swamp Grew – Even Under President Donald Trump Robert F. Smith , a Black billionaire financier, has suggested an idea - one he is calling The 2% Solution - that involves putting more capital directly into the hands of Black-owned banks. Rather than solely relying on the Community Reinvestment Act to mandate commercial banks to lend in minority communities, he suggests that we take steps to induce commercial banks to put capital equal to two percent of their annual net income, or about $2 billion a year, directly into Black-owned banks so that they can make loans. Because they are in Black communities and operate as community banks, Black-owned banks tend to be better at discerning profitable lending opportunities. More capital would allow them to lend to business ventures that may need more time to come to fruition, expanding the range of profitable lending opportunities for them. Since there aren’t enough Black-owned banks to effectively reach all Black communities in the U.S., we might need to also direct some of these funds to non-minority banks that effectively serve Black communities where they are based. Boosting the economies of Black communities by helping Black-owned banks to lend more money is not a new idea: In the early 2000s, a brilliant economist then with the FDIC named Chris Richardson suggested that we create a voucher system to replace the Community Reinvestment Act that would have essentially allowed commercial banks to pay Black-owned banks and other community banks to make loans in minority communities instead of meeting lending quotas imposed upon them. His idea closely aligns with Robert F. Smith’s proposal. And each is based on the same notion, which is that the economies in these communities will do better if it’s their own banks making the financing decisions. Alan Erenhalt’s epochal book A Lost City examines the economic decline of a formerly thriving African American community called Bronzeville. The point Erenhalt makes is that in its 1950s heyday, the neighborhood had a thriving economy, in no small part due to the fact that nearly all of the businesses in the neighborhood were Black-owned and operated in a relatively self-contained economy. Its residents went to a Black-owned grocer, a Black-owned mortuary, and a Black-owned five-and-dime store, and—most importantly—everyone put their savings into the local Black-owned bank. When urban renewal cleared the slums and destroyed much of its housing stock, the government also took steps to ostensibly help its local economy by bringing in larger, newer chain stores, supermarkets, and banks. While it did give consumers lower prices, these effectively pushed out the Black-owned businesses, which was problematic because not all of the businesses that replaced them were keen on hiring Black workers for management jobs or other key positions of responsibility. As a result, the men who ran the local butcher or other local businesses went elsewhere to find work and the community gradually lost its middle-class base. And after a while, the local banks saw few people worth lending to in the community and were ultimately absorbed by larger white-owned banks. The point is that black-owned banks once worked in America. While it is more difficult today for smaller banks to remain viable, we have a financial system that intentionally makes it possible for smaller banks to function and thrive in the right conditions. An infusion of capital, directed by Black-owned banks, represents a promising way to boost these economies.",

    "full_description": "Image source: The Motley Fool. Alliance Resource Partners ( NASDAQ:ARLP ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 10:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Greetings, and welcome to the Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. third-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Brian Cantrell, senior vice president and chief financial officer. Thank you. You may begin. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Darryl, and welcome, everyone. Earlier this morning, Alliance Resource Partners released its third-quarter 2021 financial and operating results and will now discuss these results, as well as our perspective on market conditions and outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. Before beginning, a reminder that some of our remarks today may include forward-looking statements, subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are contained in our filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also reflected in this morning's press release. While these forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those we projected or expected. In providing these remarks, the partnership has no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law to do so. Finally, we'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions and reconciliations of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable gap financial measures are contained at the end of ARLP's press release, which has been posted on our website and furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K. With the required preliminaries out of the way. I'll begin with a review of our results for the quarter and then turn the call over to Joe Craft, our chairman, president, and chief executive officer, for his comments. The exceptional performance delivered by Alliance through the first half of the year continued into the 2021 quarter. As we reported earlier this morning, ARLP again posted sequential increases to total revenues, net income, EBITDA, and free cash flow. Strong performance from both our coal operations and our royalty segments led total revenues higher by $53 million to $414.4 million, with net increase -- income increasing $13.5 million to $57.5 million or $0.44 per unit and EBITDA climbing $17.3 million to $135.9 million. Free cash flow also rose during the 2021 quarter, increasing $40.3 million to $119.7 million. ARLP's strong cash flow performance during the 2021 quarter allowed us to return $12.7 million to unitholders through the quarterly distribution we paid in August and further improved our balance sheet, as total leverage fell to 0.95 times, a 12% reduction from the sequential quarter. And liquidity increased $102.1 million to $602.6 million. ARLP's financial and operating results for the 2021 quarter and the first nine months of 2021 were also much improved compared to the 2020 quarter-end period. Compared to the 2020 quarter, total revenues increased 16.8% as a result of higher coal sales volumes and significantly higher oil and gas prices, while net income jumped 111.4% and EBITDA climbed 14.4%. Compared to the 2020 period, coal sales volumes increased 15% during the 2021 period, driving total revenues higher by 14% to $1.1 billion. Coal production volumes also increased during the 2021 period, jumping 20.1% to 23.5 million tons compared to 20.1 million tons during the 2020 period. Increased coal production and the benefits of ongoing cost control and efficiency initiatives at our mining operations drove segment-adjusted EBITDA expense per ton sold lower by 11.1% to $28.82 per ton during the 2021 period compared to $32.43 per ton for the 2020 period. Net income increased $290.5 million to $126.3 million, reflecting higher revenues and lower depreciation in the 2021 period and $157 million of non cash impairment charges in the 2020 period. Excluding these impairment charges, net income of $126.3 million for the 2021 period compares to an adjusted net loss of $7.2 million for the pandemic-impacted 2020 period. EBITDA for the 2021 period increased 31.5% to $348.9 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $265.3 million in the 2020 period. Turning from our consolidated results, let's now take a closer look at the performance of ARLP's business segments. Reflecting strong coal demand, which led to higher sales tons and price realizations at our coal operations, coal sales revenues rose 11.1% to $362.3 million during the 2021 quarter compared to the sequential quarter. Segment-adjusted EBITDA expense increased modestly to $28.95 per ton sold as inflationary pressures are beginning to impact our coal operations. Increased revenues more than offset higher per-ton operating expenses, driving segment-adjusted EBITDA for our coal operations up by 10.9% to $126.3 million. ARLP's royalty businesses also performed well during the 2021 quarter. For our oil and gas royalties, segment-adjusted EBITDA during the 2021 quarter rose 24.1% to $19.1 million as sales volumes and price realizations improved compared to the sequential quarter. Benefitting from increased revenues and royalty tons sold during the 2021 quarter, ARLP's coal business -- coal royalties business delivered $9.2 million of segment-adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 35.6% compared to the sequential quarter. The strong performance of both of these businesses resulted in ARLP's total royalty segment posting a record $28.3 million of segment-adjusted EBITDA during the 2021 quarter. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for his comments. Joe? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Brian, and welcome, everyone. Since our last earnings call, fossil fuel prices have increased dramatically around the world as supply has fallen woefully short of demand. Since the beginning of this year, worldwide LNG prices have escalated fourfold in Asia and Europe. The API 2 index for thermal coal prices has more than doubled as weather-impacted, unreliable, renewable power generation did not show up at expected levels. And utilities increasingly turn to coal in response to high natural gas prices. In the United States, natural gas prices had nearly doubled, causing coal-fired generation and ARLP's primary markets to jump 23% year over year. Coal generation could have been even higher. However, supply has been limited due to numerous issues, almost none of which should be attributed to the producers of America's most abundant low-cost fuel, coal. Looking forward, the Biden administration's domestic energy policy agenda, combined with ESG obsessions in Europe and the United States, will most likely continue to restrict growth in fossil fuel production. Absent any significant global demand destruction, we expect fossil fuel prices will remain at elevated levels through next year and into 2023. We have benefited from the market uplift this year, as reflected in our updated full-year 2021 coal sales guidance. Assuming no delivery delays through the end of this year, coal sales volumes will be 15% higher than the pandemic-impacted 2020 levels. As natural gas prices are projected to remain favorable for coal generation next year, and coal stocks for our customers are at critically low levels, we are currently targeting a 6% to 12% increase in coal sales volumes in 2022 over 2021 levels to help meet the needs of the marketplace. ARLP has responded to rising coal demand. Our employees are working extra hours to increase current production, and our mining operations are focused on retaining ARLP's exceptional workforce and attracting new employees to further increase coal production. ARLP's customers are rewarding us for our efforts to meet their needs during this critical time, providing new commitments during the 2021 quarter for the delivery of 2.1 million tons over the balance of this year. ARLP is now sold out for 2021. And as a result of recent contract pricing, we are increasing our estimated full-year coal price realization by $1.10 per ton sold for this year. During the 2021 quarter, we also strengthened our long-term coal contract book, entering into new contracts for the delivery of another 13.2 million tons over the 2022 through 2024 time frame, and since the end of the 2021 quarter, securing new agreements for the delivery of an additional 10.7 million tons over the same three-year period. As of today, we have 29.9 million tons committed and priced for 2022, of which 2.4 million tons are committed to the thermal export market for delivery next year. ARLP has secured commitments for approximately 4 million tons of export sales in 2021, including 440,000 tons of metallurgical coal. We expect strong international demand for both thermal and metallurgical coal will continue into 2022, providing ARLP with the opportunity to place similar volumes, if not more, in the equity markets at attractive prices next year. In 2023, we have price commitments for 15.8 million tons, all in the domestic market. Market fundamentals for ARLP's royalty segment are also favorable. For our oil and gas royalties business, commodity prices have increased significantly since the beginning of the year, and the forward price curve for oil, natural gas, and gas liquids remains very favorable. Production from our existing acreage continues to improve from pandemic lows. We expect that trend to continue as E&P operators modestly increase drilling and completion activity. And we anticipate the contribution from oil and gas royalties to ARLP's consolidated results will also increase as a result of our recent acquisition of approximately 1,500 net royalty acres in the Delaware portion of the Permian Basin. With the active development already underway and a significant inventory of wells to be ultimately compete -- completed on the acquired acreage, this transaction should provide a long-term uplift to the performance of our oil and gas royalties business. We also anticipate steady growth from our coal royalties business as increased coal sales volumes and prices from ARLP's mining operations should benefit this part of our business as well. As a result, we expect the contribution of our total royalty segment to ARLP's consolidated results will continue to increase in the future. In closing, I want to address our thoughts on setting unitholder distributions. After suspending unitholder distributions in response to the challenges and uncertainties created by the pandemic, ARLP's performance and outlook had improved to the point that we were pleased to reinstate unitholder distributions earlier this year, targeting an annualized distribution level at approximately 30% of anticipated full-year free cash flow at the time. ARLP's performance since then has obviously been exceptional, well above our expectations. And the positive future outlook for energy market fundamentals contributed to the board's decision this quarter to double the distribution to our unitholders compared to the sequential quarter. As I just mentioned, coal, oil, and natural gas market fundamentals appear to be extremely favorable for the next several years. And with our long-life, low-cost, strategically located assets, ARLP is well-positioned to deliver solid results for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to provide attractive cash returns to our unitholders and provide ARLP with the flexibility to pursue long-term growth opportunities while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. While ARLP is aggressively pursuing opportunities to benefit from current market conditions, we are also aware that significant uncertainties remain. The same market environment that is so favorable to ARLP business today should also serve as a wake-up call to politicians, regulators, financial institutions, utilities, and customers or consumers as they contemplate the future. Policies favoring a rapid movement away from reliable baseload-generating capacity to an ever-increasing premature reliance on intermittent power sources have already resulted in power disruptions in the United States, an energy crisis in Europe, and power shortages in China and India. We are hopeful that as the energy transition continues to devolve, it will do so in a way that not only continues to push new technologies and innovation but also with an honest recognition of the pace at which this can be deployed. This requires an acknowledgment by these policymakers of the importance of coal-fired power generation in order to maintain access to low-cost, reliable power until the transition is completed sometime over the next several decades. As the future of energy continues to evolve, ARLP intends to be there for our customers, providing the fuel essentials to meeting their needs today and profitably investing in opportunities that will help them keep the lights on in the future. That concludes our prepared comments, and I'll now ask the operator to open the call for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Nathan Martin with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your questions. Nathan Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, Joe, Brian. Congrats on the quarter. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Nate. Appreciate it. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Nathan Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Coal production, I'd say, came in a little lighter than expected. I'm guessing that's driven the decrease in full-year shipment guidance, you know, given the strong market we're seeing, as you guys pointed out, you most probably weren't expecting a downward revision. Obviously, even the revised guidance looks like it would imply a very strong fourth quarter on both the production and shipment side. Could you guys maybe talk about the factors leading to that change? Is labor a factor at all there? You also mentioned some issues, maybe with delivery delays affecting that, maybe a little color there. And then, kind of looking ahead to 2022, I think I caught you guys said that the shipments should be up about 6% to 12% year over year. Can you give us an idea how you plan to increase tons there? Thank you. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Yes, we have had -- you know, shipments were definitely impacted by some supply chain issues from the transportation sector to where we had sev -- you know, we had some plant shipments that did not occur because of the unavailability of transportation equipment. You know, we continue to see that as a challenge going forward. We do expect to hit our guidance with fourth quarter shipments assuming that transportation shows up. You know, at this time, we have commitments that that will happen, but you know, we'll have to wait and see on that. As far as our production, COVID still has impacted our operations. So we did have quite a few employees that were off this past quarter that impacted production somewhat. Not significantly, but it did account for some of that shortfall. You know, we're working extra time this quarter to try to make sure that we can achieve our objectives for the year. So we are working out extra days on the weekends to try to meet that objective. In addition, starting next week, we've added a unit of production at our NC mining operation in Appalachia that will be fully staffed and producing some additional tons in the fourth quarter going into next year. So we are looking at adding some production next year that will be driven primarily by again working extra hours and extra days, as well as maybe adding a few units so that 6% to 12% will be largely dependent on labor force and supply chain. You know, we feel good about having the equipment based on what we have within our operations. That's going to be an availability issue for most people but not for us. As far as the equipment availability I'm just speaking of, labor -- we're feeling good about our ability to attract labor since we have commitments that are starting to grow over the next three years and strong support from our domestic customers that have given us sufficient signals to provide the confidence to try to bring on a unit or two. That growth right now is probably two-thirds. Mostly in the Illinois Basin is basically where the growth is, except for the NC mining that I spoke of earlier. I think that answers your questions unless there's a follow-up -- Nathan Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Yes. Yes, Joe. No, I appreciate the color there. Absolutely. If I may, kind of shifting over to the pricing side of the equation, it looks like here in this year, in '21, you guys are nearly a million tons. Pretty strong pricing levels. Obviously, your full-year guidance moved up by -- looks like about $1.60 at the midpoint. You know, if you look at 2022, it looks like you basically doubled your committed and priced tons there. Obviously, you guys had such a significant portion of 2022 locked in. Can you give us any idea how pricing looks like for '22? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, given the [Inaudible] we have, it's hard to give you a price target. I'd say that there's still uncertainties there. The prices are continued to be strong. We are booking some at very attractive prices relative to what the this year's prices are. At the same time, there was quite a bit of tonnage that we booked that was earlier in the cycle, so we didn't -- we haven't been able to time everything at the top of the market. But it's safe to say that we expect revenues, you know, to be higher next year. I can't give you a precise number right now. But you know, we feel like next year of 2022 is going to be a very attractive year relative to what we've seen in the last two or three years. Nathan Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Got it. All right. I appreciate that, Joe. And then just maybe one final question. I know I asked you last quarter of your thoughts on free cash flow allocation. I think you said you'd, you know, be better positioned to answer that on the next call. Obviously, you guys felt strongly enough about what you're seeing in the markets to increase double the distribution, really. You also added some acreage on the oil and gas side. I understand there's some uncertainty out there still, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but maybe any other color you can provide on what your priorities are from a capital allocation standpoint or with the potential step-up and free cash that you guys could see next year? Thanks. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Nate, one of the uncertainties or headwind that we're looking at is just what the Biden administration's going to do. They promoted these infrastructure bills, which, on the one hand, tries to encourage workers with what we call true infrastructure. And then they've got a social infrastructure bill that intends to ask peoples not -- people not to work. I don't know what's going to happen there. It's just amazing to me that for two or three months, they stick with one particular type bill, and then all of a sudden, everything's changing, and nobody really knows what is going to be in the bill or what the impact is going to be. I think the positive news for the people in the coal business, it looks like, Senator Manchin's been successful in keeping out some of the draconian measures that were in the earlier bills. But we really need to see what in the world comes out of the Biden administration this quarter heading into next year, and what their reaction is going to be relative to whether it be legislation incentivizing alternatives, more importantly, what position are they going to take toward our financial institutions and access to capital. Because there have been signs recently that the Federal Reserve has been encouraging the banks not to lend the coal industry. So we need to really assess how the Biden administration handles the rest of the year as we think about, you know, how we allocate capital going into 2022 and beyond. I think the fundamentals are very strong. We're seeing a lot of opportunities in the oil and gas sector. We're continuing to evaluate things in the transition. Most of those things appear to have a little longer lead time instead of immediate-type acquisitions that we're continuing to spend quite a bit of time looking in that area. So our challenges, like most people now, are supply chain shortages, transportation shortages, weather, the economy, Biden regulations. Inflation is a big one. So -- and COVID. I mean, what's the pandemic going to do? Is it going to subside, or are we going to see another wave? So there are just a lot of different issues in front of us. But we feel like we're well-positioned to manage those going forward. And I wish had better clarity. But like I said, the insistence on trying to pass this legislation at a time when there's already a worker shortage, I don't know how that's going to shake out. Nathan Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Got it, Joe. I appreciate those comments and also the variables there. Just real quick, just a follow-on on the labor side of things and then the inflation that you just pointed out as well as you guys are seeing. Any thoughts on what that might add on the cost side going into next year? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, we're hoping that our productivity improvements will offset those increases, but there's definitely inflationary pressure with steel prices, natural gas prices, oil prices. You know, labor component is small relative to some of the others that are double digit in prices. But we think our margins will expand next year based on the benefit of higher revenues that will more than offset any cost increases. Nathan Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst Perfect. I think that's all I have for now. Thank you, guys, as always for the time. And best of luck in the fourth quarter. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Appreciate it, Nate. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Lin Shen with HITE. Please proceed with your questions. Lin Shen -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. That's a great quarter. And I'm just wondering, you know, some of the peers talk about that they set a target to reduce their direct operating greenhouse gas emission target. And I'm just wondering, for Alliance, is there such a approach? Or is there anything you're kind of working on? Are you seeing some low-hanging fruit you can do for maybe improve your ESG? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Not sure, it didn't come very clear to me what your question -- could you repeat your question? Lin Shen -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Just like some company -- co-company talked about they can -- they're working on to reduce their greenhouse gas emission for their operations. I'm just sort of wondering is Alliance also working on some approach to reduce your greenhouse gas emission for your operations, or some other, like, work like that. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer We're constantly looking at efficiency opportunities. We've also made some small investments in some offsets, carbon offsets, on methane emissions from closed operations, which we're continuing to look at. We're looking at other credits also potentially in the forest areas, timber area. So that will be my response to that. Brian, do you anything more? Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No, not yet. Lin Shen -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst So you don't see any near-term big opportunity for you to invest, something like carbon capture [Inaudible]. You don't foresee any near-term opportunities being there. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer The carbon capture would be more on the consumption side. Not on the operating side. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer At the utility level. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Which I don't really see anything in the near term on that from our existing customer base. Lin Shen -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Got it. And I also want to follow up. When you look at 2022, do you think about you probably will export more than 2021? Or what do you think about export market in 2022? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer We do believe the export market is going to be constructive. It's going to be robust. It will be there for us. I think what we have to balance is what are the demands for our domestic customers. And you know, so it's going to be a matter of communication and commitment. You know, we, long time -- for the longest time, really rely on our domestic base. And I think if we're asking our customers that -- for new commitments to commit for three years. And if they would commit for three years, I think our preference would be to serve that market as opposed to be in the export market on a short-term basis. If -- on the other hand, we've got some export customers that are willing to contract or commit multiple years also. So we're looking for long-term supply so that we can support bringing on the additional people to meet those needs. Lin Shen -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst OK, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer It could be higher, it could be lower depending on what the domestic market brings. Lin Shen -- HITE Hedge Asset Management LLC -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Shelly McNulty with Loomis. Please proceed with your questions. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst Hi. Thanks. Yeah. I just wanted to go back to your comments about kind of waiting on Biden administration and kind of concerning comments from the Fed in regards to, you know, advising banks not to lend to coal. Is that kind of, at this point, prohibiting you from being able to come to refinance your bonds that are callable? Is that -- would you characterize it as stopping you from doing it at this point? Or you know, if you wanted to refi tomorrow, you have banks that would be willing to act as your agents? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer We think the markets are open today. It's not a today issue. It's, you know, trying to think through what our access to capital be, you know, from the banks in particular when our revolver renews in a couple of years. So that's the primary concern right now. I think the bonds where interest rates are and where the strength of our balance sheet is, we've got some favorable responses currently. But there's just an uncertainty there that just puts a premium on us to have a strong balance sheet. We just feel like that there's -- it's hard to know three years from now where the markets are going to be, given how fast they've gone up. You know, will there be a balance or not? I mean, I'm a believer that we're going to have this supply chain disruption for a while. I just don't see anything changing that, especially if the Biden administration passes this second slug of $2 trillion that puts money in people's pockets and encourages them not to work. So if people don't show up to drive trucks at the ports or anywhere throughout the supply chain of our economy, I'm just very concerned that we're going to continue to have a lot of disruption in the supply side of the business. And it could go to anything and everything. I mean, that's an area that we're not immune to having just products coming to the coal mine, as an example. It affects everything throughout the economic food chain here. So I think the policies really need to be focused on what's good for the economy as opposed to the 2022 election, which, in my opinion, is what's driving their urgency to try to get something passed. It has nothing to do with what's right for America, in my opinion. But we just have to wait and see. I can't -- yeah. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst OK, got it. And then, for your exported tons, what is the major market that you're exporting to at this point? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So we have markets to India, and some to Europe, and some to the Middle East, a little bit to the Far East, not a lot. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst And what's the kind of breakeven that you need to see to make the margin more attractive on the export side? Get a better return on -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, the price is there -- I mean, the price markers are there. It's just a matter of whether we should be selling into the export market or the domestic market. And we're further challenged by the fact that we really have no supply to sell for the next two quarters and maybe three. So when we're looking at what participation we would have in the export market, unless we can bring on these additional tons, you know, we're looking at second half of next year. And a lot can happen in that price curve compared to where we are today, but I still believe that there's definitely going to be opportunity from a price standpoint for us to sell into that market. It's really just a matter where the domestic customers -- would they prefer to have the tons stay in America, or are they not willing to commit a longer term. And if they don't, then we'll probably end up turning to the export market. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst But on the shipments that got impacted by logistical, you know, issues, that I would assume mostly just impacted the domestic shipments, not your exported shipments. So if you can't move the tons because of the domestic freight or whatnot, can you kind of move them into the export market quickly on a spot basis just to kind of get those tons out? Or -- how does that work? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, the transportation is going to be impacting both domestic and export at the same time. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst OK. OK. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So it's not -- you know, there's either -- there's only so many train crews. There have been employee, you know, work issues also, trying to fill their seats on their train. So most of it's a labor issue for the railroads. You've got the, you know, the vessels on the seas that, you know, just -- it's a logistics timing issue. So again, our challenge in America is most producers are all sold out. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst Yes. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer So it's hard to take full advantage of these high prices that you see in the near term. Shelly McNulty -- Loomis, Sayles & Company -- Analyst OK. And the ability to restock inventory for next year is kind of limited in the sense that some of that capacity that closed during the pandemic, is it able to quickly, you know, restart? Or is there then too much domestic coal capacity permanently shut because of the rhetoric of we don't want the coal anymore? How do you -- is it ever gonna be possible for the utility to restock inventory level to a point where we have a good cushion? And I know it's dependent on that. I know that is dependent on the policy, too. But are they wanting to restock? Or are they comfortable with operating at these levels of inventory? Have they had -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Utilities would love to be restocking right now. But they're more focused on just maintaining their con -- you know, getting the coal that they've got under contract so that they're prepared for the winter without having to run out coal. I mean they're very low, the lowest I've seen in a long time. And so everybody is focused on trying to make sure we meet the commitments that they've made. I think as far as restocking, from a producer standpoint, yes, the pandemic did impact coal production by 20%. And once you close that out -- those operations it is tough to bring them back. I think that thinking of new operations, I know there's a couple of people out there trying to do it, but most of what we see of new production is all metallurgical coal. There's just been an abandonment by most producers of the thermal business. I mean, we're one of the very few that's committed to the thermal business for the life of the power plants through 2035, 2040, 2045. So it's hard for people to get financing to open new thermal mines. I just don't see it happening. But there is excess capacity because of the pandemic for people like us to where we don't have to make large investments. We just have to hire people to get the full capacity. And I think that's what most other people would be doing. Most other people that are in the thermal business are doing it the way we're doing it. And that's really just working extra hours and trying to increase their production that way as opposed to thinking about making capital investments that would bring on supply that would have an overhang in the future. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Please -- Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. I just wanted to ask about kind of the strong balance sheet that you sort of, you know, highlighted that that's sort of a continuing priority for you. You know, pre-pandemic, you had always kind of talked about one turn of leverage as that kind of comfortable level. And now as we get sort of, you know, into a more favorable environment for you and you're starting to increase, you know, the distribution, we're kind of at that one turn of leverage. And it's just -- you know, I wanted to get a sense of where you are at this inflection point of, you know, balancing the balance sheet versus shareholder interests and kind of where you want to see the balance sheet maintained as you kind of try to address shareholders that haven't had their distribution in a while. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I think the objective is the same. I think our -- you know, next year probably because EBITDA is going to be higher, you're going to see that drop below that. Our concern is 2023. There's a lot of plants that are scheduled to close in the coal space. We need to see, again, what the Biden policies do, not only legislatively but from a regulatory standpoint, as to whether or not these coal plants will stay up longer or whether they'll close faster. And so when we are trying to think about, you know, the transition, we need to be able to continue to make acquisitions so that our EBITDA will grow from things other than coal. So that as we look to 2030, 2035 that our company has strong growth for the long term instead of trying to think that the coal business is going to be around for the next 50 years, which would allow us to return to coverage ratios like we've had when we had more security that we had a longer runway. So that -- you know, I think both the access to capital and the future demand for our product are two major issues that influence what our reserves have to be so that we can have the ability to have a strong balance sheet so that we can survive and no matter what environment is presented to us, but at the same time still be able to return a sufficient amount of cash to the shareholders, which I support strongly as a major shareholder. But we had to be prudent in looking not only for the short term but for the intermediate term and the challenges our industry faces. And I'm hopeful that -- as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm hopeful that our policymakers would accept the fact that you can't replace fossil fuels overnight. And I don't know why they -- why the financial community thinks that we can. I don't know why they can't see the need to finance fossil fuels through the transition as opposed to saying, \"Well, I know the transition is going to occur until 2035, 2040, but I'm not -- I'm going to stop lending to you tomorrow.\" That just doesn't make sense to me. But unfortunately, there are banks out there that are taking that position, and so it influences how we can think about our balance sheet, and therefore, we can't use leverage like most other industries can. So when you look at our balance sheet, it is conservative relative to others because we do have lenders that are shying away from the coal world unfortunately. Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst So not -- you know, at the risk of oversimplifying, it sounds like, you know, trying to play some offense and defense with offense being the, you know, the royalty business and then defense being kind of your strong balance sheet to -- in the absence of information on what the regulatory and legislative policy is going to be. And you know, maybe that one turn of leverage, which was a pretty pre-pandemic level, is -- are you saying is that -- I don't want to put words in your mouth. So is -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean it -- Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst You know, 450 million of debt too much right now, or -- Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer No. No, we think that that's very doable and we could even take on some more. Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer But what I'm trying to say is we look at different scenarios, and we feel very good about the next four or five years. If markets were working, we would be having a totally different conversation. But unfortunately, we've gotten government interference in markets, and it goes through everything we do, whether it's FERC, whether it's the Fed, whether it's the regulatory, I mean, there's constantly -- whether it's the legislative giving, when and so are all these tax credits when they don't need them. I mean, they say they don't need them, and yet the government keeps throwing -- they want to throw $300 billion at them, according to the last thing I read. And some people tell me that it's really going up to 600 over 20 years. I mean, when it was a year, a year, a year, now all of a sudden, they think they need to do it for 10 years. What's that all about? So yeah -- so we feel like, you know, we can sustain, you know, $500 million or $600 million of debt, but at the same time we need to see how these policies impact other people's behavior toward -- it's not what we can support, it's what we can borrow at a reasonable price. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer What the financial institutions will allow us to do. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. If that makes -- yeah. Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst So practically speaking, does that mean that, you know, you're gonna have to hold more cash on your balance sheet and depend less on a revolver, which may or may not be as available to you after 2023? Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Or we're in the process of looking at alternative markets. And there are some. There are people out there that see the strong credit and realize that we're going to be there for the next 20 years and that we're a solid credit. So there are alternatives that we're looking at. We just don't have good idea what the pricing is going to be two years from now as opposed to the pricing today. I mean, it's attractive today, but we don't need the money today. We need it a couple of years from now when our revolver -- Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Are you talking about going into the private debt market or a sort of a private revolver or with a nonbank institution? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, the latter. Matthew Fields -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst OK. That's very interesting. You know, I appreciate it, and good luck this -- the rest of this year and next. Thank you. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer OK. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Scott Ferguson with Pacific Value. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Ferguson -- Pacific Value -- Analyst Hi guys. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Scott. Scott Ferguson -- Pacific Value -- Analyst Just a couple questions. I'll just rattle them off and let you go. But I know you guys touched on this in an earlier question, but just ballpark, the amount of tonnage you guys have booked for next year, how much was booked before this recent price run-up? And then secondly, you guys in the past have mentioned investments that you guys were close to pulling the trigger or were looking at that we're outside of oil and gas. Are those still on the table, and potential timing? So thanks, guys. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, as far as the booking of business, I'd say that most of this was really pretty ratable ever since our last call. So we booked some in August, September, October. I'd say it's probably a third, a third, a third. I don't know, maybe it's a little -- maybe it's something in that neighborhood would be what I would guess. I haven't really looked at it that way, but I would say that it's probably in that zip code of a third, a third, a third, maybe -- yeah, I don't know. Brian, I'll defer to you. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No, that's about right. I mean, I think if you look at our committed tons at the end of the second quarter -- third quarter compared to the end of the second quarter, we about doubled it this quarter. And then, as we mentioned in the call, since the end of the third quarter, we booked another 10.7 million tons of volumes. So tough to time the market, obviously. I think Joe's characterization of we are constantly in the market, we're constantly booking agreements at pricing that's attractive at that time. So we've definitely caught some of the uplift. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase our full-year sales price realizations by $1.10 in one quarter speaks to that. But it has been occurring on a more ratable basis. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer And we increased last quarter. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Also, in anticipation of some of that. So we've got -- I mean, our revenue is up. We're $150 million, I think, for the year. So we were able to capture some of that before the July call, and then we add some after. As far as the acquisitions, you know, non fossil, what we're -- we've looked at in some of the transition-type investments. We're seeing significant inflation in some of the fundamental elements to go into different aspects of the various different alternatives that we've been looking at. We still have -- most of the products are actually supplied from overseas, from China. So there's still been some issues on what the tariffs are going to be and not be. So as we see the economics of what has driven the growth in some of those renewable spaces, looking forward, it appears to us that the costs are going to be higher, but we haven't seen a desire on PPA, as an example, of adjusting to that. We've also sort of formed a view that if there's going to be a fast acceleration toward wind solar batteries, then we think that the prices are going to be better a little later than they are today. And it may be prudent to wait a while before jumping into that space, especially if there's 10-year tax credits instead of one-year tax credits. So much of what was driving a one-year deal was we're trying to do something sooner than later. It was because tax credits were expiring. It sounds like they're going to get extended, so to me, that takes some of the urgency off and allows for participation at a better entry point than trying to do something sooner compared to later. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Arthur Calavritinos with ANC Capital. Please proceed with your questions. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Thank you very much, guys. Hi, it's great to see these numbers in black and white, so good for you and good for us. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Question I had, Joe, I'm reading all this stuff in India, three days' worth of supply. Spain is a disaster. England had to turn on a coal plant, which is basically going to blow up, but they've realized the wind doesn't blow, and all this other stuff. And I was wondering if those guys have to -- they have to take their inventories worldwide. They're realizing it now. What does that mean, I mean, for you? Because you made a statement earlier, which caught my attention when you said you'd rather keep the coal domestically because you want three-year contracts, and I get that. And at some point, I got to think that guys in India, you know, pick a country are going to be like we're going to play and we're going to do the three-year contracts or something like that. And I'm sure you're probably getting phone calls from those guys. So how does this play out? Because I just got to think your phone is going to be ringing off the hook with guys that are finally saying, \"OK, I'm not going to do a one-year or less-than-year contract. I want to go longer for a certain price.\" Because if you run out of electricity in like India, I mean, the guy running utility is going to get killed, right? I mean, in all these countries. I mean, I don't think the guys -- people get what's going on out there. So just if you could just expand on that. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So a couple of things. We, as I mentioned earlier, we are having conversation with some export customers that are willing to commit longer term. Back to your point. Second -- Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Is that news? Is that news to them? Is that like -- did they finally acquiesce and OK, that's the new paradigm? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Well, we -- yeah, this year, we actually had a customer that committed for a full year. You know, normally they're quarter to quarter, vessel by vessel is what we participated in. So this year, we've had actually two customers that have committed for longer term within a year. Now, we're talking about even longer. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst OK. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I think when you look at Europe, one of the -- you know, you're exactly right. I mean, it's sort of -- should be a wake-up call. But what we are seeing is now we've got oil being -- replacing natural gas even. These guys are trying to scramble around to try to make sure that people have enough gas for the winter. So it's -- I've never seen anything like this is all I can say. And -- Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst OK, what -- go ahead. I'm sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry, go ahead. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. But we're very focused on trying to take, you know, full benefit of what the markets give us, but you know, we feel that our best policy is to really think longer term and short term. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst OK, and -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Given the headwind and spacing our coal industry come in politically like I've mentioned before. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Oh, no. Look, I mean, I don't know what the industry would have been like if you took the pro forma closures for '23 and you had them this year, right? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Correct. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst And then those electrons get substituted by nat gas. I mean, I'm in Boston, nat gas in Maine is like at the -- terminus there is like 20 bucks, right? We're at 550 on a cushion. And guys still don't get this because they look at gasoline in terms of what energy costs are rather than electricity until it hits, which is going to start hitting in about two or three months. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Can you get work -- I've talked to guys -- energy guys, and one of the things that has come back from some utility guys, well, they worry about is the ability you guys being able to get workers an extra shift, we start to mine. Because I'm sure, there's a lot of guys that, even though the pay would be greater, probably wouldn't want to go back because they're like, \"I can make more money for a year. But then the administration, all the talk this coal is going away, other than make less money and have more certainty in what I'm doing, then just go to a coal -- I mean, mine coal for a year.\" Just wondering how tough it is, you know -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, that's why it's important to get long-term contracts so that we can not only talk about it, but reinforce it with commitment. There's potential that we have some even longer-term contracts that we're in conversations with right now. But one of the things -- I may have mentioned this -- I don't know. I've had so many calls. I don't know which call or whether it's last quarter or not. But we have one customer that actually came to our coal mines and talked to our men, saying we need you, we need you for 15 years. That's how long, at a minimum, that's how long our plants are going to run. So we appreciate what you do. And even though we can't commit for 15 years contractually because of company policy, but we're here to tell you that we need you. And that was very impactful. And so what we've seen is with the fortunes that have turned, and with the price signals that we have, and the opportunity to reposition our pay policies without in a way to make it more attractive, people had a taste of going to a manufacturing job that is the same thing every day. Whereas when they come to coal mine, it's different every day. Every day they work, they're working in a different place. And so we've had great success. We've hired over 150 people in the last quarter that had left us earlier in a year. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Wow. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Because they see the opportunity over the next several years. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst OK. Good to hear. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer And as I mentioned, we were just able to recruit two shifts in Eastern Kentucky, which is amazing, given the fact that we're competing against metallurgical coal guys. They're trying to hire the same folks. So we've got great benefits, we got great culture, we got great people. We feel if anybody can hire employees, it's us. So we feel that -- I'm sure there's other of our competitors who feel the same way, but I mean, we've -- like I said, we've been able to hire that many people just in the last quarter, given the strength of these three-year contracts that we've been able to secure during that time. So we're -- yeah. At the same time, if Biden comes out and says pay people more money to stay at home -- Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Yeah, not everybody became a computer coder. Like, you know, the two administrations ago said all the coal miners were going to become computer programmers. So yeah. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Yeah. Let me ask you one other thing, you said something to [Inaudible]. Utilities, if they mothball a coal plant and to restart it, it doesn't happen overnight. You made a statement like that earlier on the remarks. I mean -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer That was a coal -- those were coal mines. Not the util -- I think one's the -- Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Coal mines. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Not the on -- not the -- OK, got it. It was the mines. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Not the utilities. I think once the coal plant is offline, it's very, very -- it's very unlikely that it'll start back up now. Having said that, there is a plant in the UK that they went back and brought out of the Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Out of mothball, yeah. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. But it's unlikely that you'll see any coal plant that's been closed brought back into service until the policies change, unless the Federal -- Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst And one -- I'm sorry. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Unless by -- unless the government says we need you. Like they did in 1970s when we had an energy crisis here. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Do you think -- last one and I'll take it with you guys offline. I got to think there's got to be a price on nat gas electricity eventually that gets people to get off your back and realize what's going on. And plus, like, I think with Yuri superstorm, the cold storm in -- the event in Texas, in Houston, I mean, to me, that would have been the wake-up call, but it seems like we've forgotten about it. As you think -- as I think about it and you think about it, is there like a price where people via electricity bills -- like I said, they haven't been reset yet for the rates. They're starting to but they haven't fully, and plus we're in a seasonal low. That that's the wake-up call. I mean, because I think eventually price drives all regulations. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer You think so? Yeah, yeah. When you look at fossil fuels, mostly oil and some natural gas, what it does and permeates through any and all products. This morning, I think it was Wall Street Journal had a deal on baby diapers. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Right. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer And showing the increasing cost of baby diapers and traced it back to lumber and oil. And that's true with so many products that we use. I think that's the one thing that most people in America don't understand is all the byproducts that we use day to day that are derivative oil. But back to your question, I think it's going to take more than price. I think it's going to take blackouts before the politicians start to say, \"Wow, I didn't know my policies were going to impact people's lives like they did in Texas where you had over 50 people die.\" I'm afraid that that's what's going to take to get the policymakers and the CEOs of banks and the BlackRocks of the world -- Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Yeah, I agree with you. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Will realize that the policies we're advocating here, and they're going to China and they're investing over there but they won't say a word. China's 70% coal-fired generation. They got more power plants being built today than we have in existence. And they say nothing. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Yeah, no, no, I think -- Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer You think that would wake up America, but... Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Yeah, no, yeah, you're right. Unfortunately, I agree with you. It's going to take like -- it's going to have to take blackouts like, I mean, in the Boston area, like in January or February when it's cold. And you know -- or you shut down electricity and manufacturing plants. When I was a kid in the 70s, that's -- I think that's what happened. They just shut stuff down, you know. And even if FERC sent a notice out to the grid operators in this region, and they just said, you got to store more nat gas. And it's like, thanks for the warning, but people don't get it yet. You're going to need a black -- you're going to need blackouts and in the wintertime, you know, or something like -- unfortunately, something like that. OK. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, unfortunately. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Unfortunately. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst All right, thank you very much. And I'll be back offline with you, guys. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer You bet. Arthur Calavritinos -- ANC Capital -- Analyst Or I'll call you guys. Thank you. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Cosgrove with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your questions. Andrew Cosgrove -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst Hey, gentlemen, thanks for taking my questions. Just one, if you could just give us an idea on where current IOB prices are today. And then, I guess along the same lines would be assuming -- you know, if you could expand if it's like the new kind of range for gas. Obviously, hot month is five. But if we were to settle somewhere closer to 350, what do you think the right price for IOB coal is in that environment? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think most of the publications you see out there are showing prices in the $80 to $90 range for Illinois Basin pricing today. I think that anything above $4 can support prices that high if you're just looking at coal versus gas competition. At the same time, if you start thinking about coal on coal, it would drop the price down to some other price level, which we just don't see happening in 2022. It may happen toward the end of the year, it may not. I just feel like that, you know, it's really difficult to bring on enough volume to meet the demand. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks, if there had been enough coal supply, you know, we would have seen more coal consumed in the fourth quarter than what we're going to see. And so right now, as far as trying to get coal -- now, they can get Powder River Basin in the market easier, and you can -- the underground mines in the East. And then you're also facing the competition of the export market like an earlier caller talked about that there are some folks that are looking more to just sell on the export market in the short term, but I can't give you an exact price on the 350. We don't see it going to 350. It's possible, it could, but we will be definitely booked up in 2022 before that happens. Andrew Cosgrove -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst All right, OK, I mean I think the caller, as far as what you just said, with anything over $4 supporting somewhere near spot is pretty telling in and of itself, so I appreciate that. I guess the other one would be if you could maybe expand on, you know, any inflation on the rail side or the bar side. And maybe if you could just refresh my memory as far as how you guys move coal down to the Gulf Coast, and then anything as far as what that cost today versus where it was and where it might be going. Because I know, on the net side, for rail specifically, I guess the rules prior to what's coming up next year was around 20 bucks a ton. And obviously, I know we're talking about different geographies, but that's going to double next year. So I was just curious, you know, what that looks like in you guys' neck of the woods. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I think on the transportation side, I don't consider it really inflation as a cost push to their pricing. Andrew Cosgrove -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst Right. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer I think it's more just -- it's all really supply and demand as the who can pay the -- who's going to pay what price and what movement. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer And we will commit. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So on the domestic side, on the rail side, that's usually determined by our customers, and then they usually have long-term contract, they have pricing associated with that. So when we think about pricing for domestic shipments, in large part, the customers are able to maintain those prices that may be back to your inflationary-type levels. Then when you get into the spot market, it's just based on total supply and demand at the time you are shipping. And earlier -- right now, last six -- 60 days, both rail and large shipment pricing was up quite a bit to get their fair share, as they would say, of the economic grant of the higher prices. But going forward, you know, I think that we factored all those in as to how we look at what our cash flows would be. And you know, we're going to have a very strong 2022 unless the bottom falls out of the economy. Andrew Cosgrove -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst OK. And then just the last one would just be around -- can you just remind me where the bookings were for 2023 before 3Q? So, where you exit 2Q at in 2023. And I think you said you're at 15.8 million tons right now? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer All right. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, give me just a second. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Brian is looking that up. If you got another question or if anybody else has one? Andrew Cosgrove -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst Yeah, I guess the other one I think you kind of answered before but the willingness from utilities is going to keep more coal on the ground from an inventory standpoint. I guess you guys kind of said that they're just really just trying to focus on what they've contract out so far and what -- they're just focusing on those deliveries versus building up so much strategic stockpiles, right? Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Right, yeah, that's what I think. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, and since the second quarter, we've booked about 8.2 million tons into 2023. Andrew Cosgrove -- Bloomberg Intelligence -- Analyst OK. All right, that's all I had. And thank you, gentlemen, I really appreciate it, and good luck for the rest of the year. Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Cantrell for any closing remarks. Brian Cantrell -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Darryl. Good discussion this morning and we appreciate everybody's time, as well as your continued support and interest in Alliance. Our next call to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financial and operating results is currently expected to occur in late January, and we hope you will all join us again at that time. This concludes our call for today. Thanks to everyone for your participation and continued support of ARLP.

    "full_description": "What happened Shares of Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) rose 2% on Monday following bullish analyst commentary. So what Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar reiterated his overweight rating on Nvidia's stock. He now expects the semiconductor titan's share price to jump more than 12% to $260. Nvidia's stock is a buy, according to analysts at Piper Sandler. Image source: Getty Images. Kumar sees a major overhang on Nvidia's shares abating as Bitcoin ( CRYPTO:BTC ) mining's impact on its business lessens in the coming quarters. He believes more of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) could be made available for its key gaming customers ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. This, in turn, could bolster Nvidia's market share in this prized segment. It would also likely dampen the volatility in Nvidia's GPU sales that often accompany Bitcoin's wild price swings, which investors would no doubt welcome. Now what It can be difficult to identify which market its GPUs are being purchased for since most customers don't specify why they're buying its chips. However, investors tend to value Nvidia's gaming-related sales more highly than its crypto-based revenue. The market sees the tech giant's gaming business as more durable and dependable than its sales to crypto miners, which have been known to rapidly reduce purchases when cryptocurrency prices fall. This unpredictability of crypto sales has weighed on Nvidia's profits -- and, in turn, its share price -- in the past, particularly when mining-related sales plunged. So, if this volatility was to be reduced, investors might be willing to pay a higher price for Nvidia's stock.",

Netflix NFLX has had an incredible few months with the wild success of Squid Game. Since its September 17 premiere the South Korean survival drama has broken the streamer’s own records with more than 50% of its subscribers binge-watching the series and talking about it online. That’s more than 142 million member households of the 209 million overall tuning in within the first four weeks of the show’s worldwide launch, thus making it Netflix’s most-watched series to date. Can Netflix keep up the momentum? Well, suffice it to say the streamer has some very good series coming your way in November. Scoot McNairy as Walt Breslin in season 3 of 'Narcos: Mexico' on Netflix. Photo Courtesy of Netflix. Narcos: Mexico Season 3 (November 5, Ten Episodes) - The third season of this fan favorite is set in the 90s as the globalization of the drug business ignites and this season examines the war that breaks out after Felix’s arrest. As newly independent cartels struggle to survive political upheaval and escalating violence, a new generation of Mexican kingpins emerge. But in this war, truth is the first casualty and every arrest, murder and take-down only pushes real victory further away. Scoot McNairy, Diego Luna and José María Yazpik star in this nail-biter about the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel. Hailee Steinfeld as Vi in 'Arcane' on Netflix. Photo Courtesy of Netflix. MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge Arcane (November 6, Nine Episodes) - This animated event series is based on the world behind the game League of Legends . The story is centered between the rich city of Piltover and the seedy underbelly of Zaun. Tensions between these city-states boil over with the creation of Hextech in Piltover, which is a way for any person to control magical energy. In Zaun, a new drug called Shimmer transforms humans into monsters. The rivalry between the cities splits families and friends as Arcane brings life to the relationships that shape some of League of Legends ' famous champions including Vi (Hailee Steinfeld), Jinx (Ella Purnell), Caitlyn (Katie Leung), Jayce (Kevin Alejandro) and Viktor (Harry Lloyd). Joe Exotic and the gang return for the second season of 'Tiger King' in November on Netflix. Photo Courtesy of Netflix. Tiger King Season 2 aka Tiger King 2 (November 17, Five Episodes) - The first season of this doc series was a global hit with 64 million households binge-watching in the first four weeks after its March 2020 premiere. Directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin told the stories of a wild cast of characters involved in the stranger-than-fiction world of big cat owners, including that of Joe Exotic, a gun-toting polygamist and country-western singer who presided over an Oklahoma roadside zoo. Enter Carole Baskin, owner of a rival big cat sanctuary, and Joe's arrest for a murder-for-hire plot and things got really crazy. It’s anyone’s guess as to where season two will go but what we do know is that Joe is in prison and Baskin is reportedly not involved. One thing is certain with this crew, it’ll be anything but boring. John Cho as Spike Spiegel in 'Cowboy Bebop' coming to Netflix. Photo by Geoffrey Short at Netflix.

    "full_description": "Digital transformation has been a powerful tailwind for cloud-computing specialist Cloudflare ( NYSE:NET ) , and shareholders have been well compensated. The stock price has skyrocketed 139% since the beginning of 2021 and 225% over the past year. Can that tremendous growth continue? In this Backstage Pass video, recorded on Oct. 14, 2021 , Motley Fool contributor Trevor Jennewine tells investors what to watch when Cloudflare reports third-quarter earnings on Nov. 4. Trevor Jennewine: I'm going to talk about Cloudflare -- the ticker is NET -- and Cloudflare is expected to report earnings on the 4th of November. Not too much longer. I'm sure a lot of you are familiar, but Cloudflare is a cloud services provider and it provides a range of different products that are all aimed at boosting performance, security, and reliability. That's true of external content like websites and applications, but also internal resources like corporate networks and devices. So, the company really plays into digital transformation. The reason I'm excited about Cloudflare, I think it has a few different strengths. A cloud-agnostic business model, which just means it doesn't prefer any particular public cloud; it accelerates security and performance across all of these different infrastructures. That's what the little picture shows on the right here. It works, hybrid-cloud, multi-cloud environments as well as on-site datacenters, private clouds. It also has a broad portfolio of products which differentiates it from point solution providers. There are companies that are just focus on content delivery or just focus on security. Cloudflare provides networking services, security services, and the content delivery services. And because it offers a free tier of service, that brings a lot of traffic onto its platform. In fact Cloudflare powers 18% of the internet, according to W3Tech. And the next closest content delivery network on that list is Fastly with just over 1% -- so, a huge lead. That allows it to negotiate deals with Internet service providers, whereby it can keep it's equipment directly in their data centers, and that reduces bandwidth and co-location expenses for the company. I think they have a strong business model and they're growing quickly. Last quarter, they surpassed 126,000 customers, that was up 32%. Revenue was $152 million, up 53%. And strong retention rate, 124%. Customers are spending more over time. Management is guiding for a little bit of a deceleration and the third quarter, looking for $165 million to $166 million, still growing 46% though. The company is not profitable, even on a non-GAP basis, they're expecting a loss of $0.03 to $0.04. But management has talked about reaching breakeven by the first quarter of next year. They're moving in the right direction; they're definitely investing heavily in growth and I think that's the right decision for the company. They have a massive market opportunity and it makes sense to focus on growing the business. In addition to revenue and customers, the things I'm looking for are, can they maintain that high net retention rate? What does cash from operations look like? Last quarter it was positive $7.5 million -- I'd like to see that figure stay positive. Just as evidence that their business model is funding itself. Then, also management's commentary on Cloudflare One. This is a product they released last year. There is a comprehensive network as a service. It replaces outdated corporate network architectures and makes everything faster, it makes everything more secure, it allows remote employees to access corporate resources from any device, any location. This bundles a lot of their different products together and it's been a growth driver so far.",

He also discusses why this fintech company could be the next Square. Matt Frankel: SoFi, Social Finance went public by SPAC earlier this year. Their numbers have just been phenomenal. I think this company could be the next Square , and I'll show you why. Their membership growth has not really been growing impressively, grown at 113% year-over-year -- which who cares about profits when you have that growth right now? But it has been accelerating. Eight consecutive quarters. Look at that bottom number, year-over-year growth, their growth rate has been accelerating for eight consecutive quarters. The product growth is also accelerating. Look at the past seven quarters there, 71%, 85%, 89%, 101% -- it's accelerating and accelerating, the momentum is just gaining and gaining. That's a pretty impressive customer base. 2.5 million people is not Square. Square has I think 30 million active Cash App users, a few million more in its business ecosystem. So, the real key here, look at this rate here. So far it started its life as a lender. They made private student loans, they do personal loans, things like that. On the left you can see the growth of their lending products. It's ok; it's been in the teens for the past few quarters. That's not where the growth of the business comes from. They are building out their other product offerings heavily. They offer an investment platform and they're all very innovative. Their investment platform is one of the few that lets everyday investors participate in IPOs. I think them and Robinhood are the only two that do that. They have their own ETFs. They have one ETF that pays weekly dividends, which is the only one like that I know of. Really unique products that they're bringing out. SoFi Money is their banking platform. It advances their customers, their direct deposits two days before payday, really cool feature. Those are the financial services products like you see on the right. Look at that growth. I used to be a math teacher and if I was teaching a lesson on exponential growth, that might be one of the charts I used as an example in class. That is an exponentially growing customer base. If you look at the number right there and compare it to their customer count, SoFi's average customer has about 1.5 products with the company right now, a ton of potential for cross-selling products. Real quick, I'm going to skip all the way down to this. Here's some of their current financial services products. The average customer uses about 1.5 products. Not only is their user-base growing at over 100% year-over-year, but there are also this long list of products -- that is rapidly growing, by the way. The credit card was just launched this year, the investment platform got much better this year that's really gaining traction. So, not only is their user base growing more than doubling year-over-year, but they have the ability to cross-sell all of these products to their existing customers. Right now SoFi's market cap is about $15 billion. If things go well and this momentum continues, I think it could be at 10 bagger within a decade. But it's one of the ones that I'm watching. But the key is for that growth to continue at that triple-digit pace, which obviously can't be sustained forever, but can they sustain it for a little while longer? That's what I want to know. There are my thoughts on SoFi.",

They might also be generally worried about Esperion's financial health. The biotech has been habitually loss-making, and while that's usually not a deal-breaker for investors in the sector, it also has considerable debt.

Now what The bright-side view of Esperion's latest piece of financial engineering is that it will shave the company's interest costs, as the securities are being converted from what are essentially debt instruments into equity.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Beaujolais vines are pictured under the snow, on November 9, 2016 near Chenas. / AFP / JEFF PACHOUD ... [+] via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images Beaujolais is a wine region cultivated — almost exclusively — with a single grape variety: Gamay Noir à Jus Blanc, or simply, Gamay. Employed to craft the iconic regional, Village, and Cru Beaujolais red wines and also an increasing portion of rosé, one might think that if a white wine were to come from this region, it would also be made from Gamay. But no. A familiar but unexpected grape is the only one allowed in the making of Beaujolais Blanc, and that is Chardonnay. Chardonnay only accounts for about 3% of vineyards in Beaujolais — just a tiny wedge of the production — in this French region situated between the Mâconnais to the north and Lyon to the south. But this category is earning increased attention because it is a delicious diversification. Just under 2.5 million bottles of Beaujolais Blanc (includes Village — the Crus don’t produce any white wines, only red) were made in 2020. While the French keep about 65% of Beaujolais production at home, about 35% of it is exported. The U.S. is the largest export market for Beaujolais wines, followed by the U.K., Japan, and Canada. Aromatic, with notes of citrus and green apple, along with a chalky mineral complexity, this is a wine to refresh. Depending on the vintage, Beaujolais Blanc may exhibit more ripe fruit notes, but still tends to be restrained and balanced. And though the region’s reputation is built on red wine from Gamay, the production of white wine in this region has a history that reaches back just as long. Aurélien Fiardet represents Terroirs Originels, a group of artisan winemakers from Beaujolais and the Mâconnais. He says that even though production of Beaujolais Blanc may be small, there’s benefit to making it. “A diversified range is important, and it’s always good to be able to offer a few options,” he says. “It’s very useful to offer some whites.” The reason that there is so little Chardonnay in Beaujolais is “due to terroir,” according to Fiardet. Though over 300 soil variants have been identified in Beaujolais, granite substrate is responsible for many of the best examples of red Beaujolais, particularly the Cru sites. Melissa Monosoff, a Master Sommelier based in Texas, says that granite is the “soil of choice” for Gamay, which controls yields and can promise a more concentrated wine.

But in areas where the soil is more favorable to Chardonnay, he notices that new plantings are popping up. These favorable spots tend to be in the northernmost pockets of Beaujolais, situated as they are on the border with Bourgogne (Burgundy) where Chardonnay is, of course, the primary white wine suspect. In certain areas up around the Saint-Amour appellation there are some vineyards that could be sold as Mâcon or Bourgogne Blanc. There’s also Chardonnay found in the eastern part of Beaujolais, where the soils are more alluvial than granite. Beaujolais Blanc can come from the the regional appellation (simply: Beaujolais) or Beaujolais Villages. The Villages versions are often more complex and will permit a few years of aging. Beaujolais Cru is only produced in red, so you won’t find any Blanc from this category on the market. Fiardet says that Beaujolais Blanc is three things besides tasty: “small production, spread out, and hard to find.” But though there’s not a lot of it in the U.S. market, it’s worth grabbing a bottle when you find them. Generally affordable and versatile, these wines will go with many meals including weeknight dining and special occasions.",

The Chinese electric vehicle company plans to roll out a flying car that is also roadworthy, but it also made a few down-to-earth announcements. So what HT Aero, an affiliate backed by XPeng and its founder He Xiaopeng, showcased a flying car at XPeng's annual Tech Day event on Sunday. While the car is not yet available to consumers, the company said it has plans to mass-produce the car and make it available to customers by 2024. The price is currently expected to be 1 million Chinese yuan (roughly $157,000). Image source: Getty Images. The vehicle is expected to have rotors that will fold away for storage when driving on land. When extended, they allow the car to take flight. This is the sixth prototype of the vehicle, which XPeng says has completed more than 15,000 safe test flights during the past eight years. Not all the announcements were pie in the sky. XPeng also said it plans to continue to build out its network of charging stations. The company is planning to introduce the next generation of its X-Power supercharger, which will charge a vehicle for driving of up to 200 kilometers (roughly 124 miles) within about five minutes. XPeng also plans to launch a lightweight supercharger with similar capabilities. Now what It's important to note that many of these innovations are still in the developmental stages and not yet ready for prime time. That said, investors can look to XPeng's recent operating and financial results for inspiration. In the second quarter, year over year, the company's vehicle deliveries reached 17,398, up 439%, while revenue of $582.5 million surged 537%. As with many early-stage start-ups, XPeng is still losing money, though the company cut its operating loss by half, so its results are moving in the right direction. Its recent performance offers a far better reason to own the stock than the potential for a flying car -- as cool as that might be.",

    "full_description": "Kanye West’s Yeezy clothing line is coveted by fans who love its drape-y fits and modern silhouettes. So are his bulbous sneakers. But supporters may find themselves waiting a while to receive their Yeezy purchases — and those delays allegedly violate California’s business code. That’s according to a lawsuit filed by the state of California against West’s fashion business on Oct. 22 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The lawsuit alleges that the musician’s Yeezy Apparel and Yeezy companies violated a section of state business code that requires items sold over the internet to be shipped within 30 days — and if they aren’t, the merchant must provide a refund, or pursue another of several prescribed remedies, including issuing a delay notice. The civil complaint against West’s two La Palma-based companies was filed by L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gascón, who is joined in the matter by the district attorneys of Alameda, Napa and Sonoma counties. West, 44, is best known in fashion for a minimalist range of out-there athleisure wear and a popular, long-running footwear collaboration with Adidas. While various online retailers offer Yeezy items, West’s companies also sell them via the website yeezysupply.com. The district attorneys alleged in their complaint that West’s businesses failed to give customers adequate delay notices on items than hadn’t shipped within 30 days; these messages are required by the state to detail the expected length of the delay and offer a refund upon request. Among other claimed violations of the business code, the complaint also alleged that Yeezy Apparel and Yeezy made untrue or misleading statements about their ability to “ship products within a certain timeframe, particularly where customers paid an additional charge for expedited shipping.” The lawsuit did not provide an exact date when the alleged violations of the state code began. There is no public record of West’s companies’ response to the allegations. A representative for his fashion business did not immediately respond to requests for comment and Gascón’s office declined to comment. The musician, whose net worth is pegged at $1.8 billion by Forbes , has long been interested in fashion. He began dabbling in apparel and footwear in the late-2000s, collaborating with companies include A Bathing Ape, Louis Vuitton and Nike. Later, he forged the partnership with Adidas , which has produced Yeezy sneakers since 2013. West struck a deal with Gap Inc. last year to design adult and kids’ clothing for the San Francisco-based apparel giant. The first items from the effort were released earlier this year; in September a $90 sweatshirt sold out within hours of debuting . West’s Yeezy sneakers have for years been coveted by footwear aficionados, and often trade for many multiples of their list prices on the secondary market. With some pairs fetching thousands of dollars, the interest in the shoes has led to widespread counterfeiting . Business Counterfeit Yeezys and the booming sneaker black market Counterfeit Yeezys and the booming sneaker black market By David Pierson Sept. 5, 2017 Kevin longed for a pair of Adidas’ “pirate black” Yeezys, a charcoal-colored edition of the ultra-hip sneakers designed by rapper Kanye West. Gascón and the other district attorneys are seeking a judgment that would permanently restrain West’s companies from repeating the alleged practices, as well as fines of up to $2,500 for each breach of the state business code, along with restitution for affected consumers. Times staff writer Adam Tschorn contributed to this report.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Woman in energy industry, from Power Magazine, ... [+] https://www.powermag.com/women-are-essential-to-a-thriving-power-generation-sector/ Power magazine The pandemic has caused millions of people, especially women, to rethink their careers. It may have been stimulated by all that time working from home, or the shift to remote work opening up opportunities in any location, or homeschooling their kids for months while schools were closed, or the joy they found in hobbies or side hustles. It’s no wonder that a Bankrate survey found 55% of people say they are looking to change jobs over the next 12 months. This is especially true among people who want to use their skills and talents to address climate change and/or socio-economic inequities. More opportunities are opening up in these areas than ever before. There are few industries where this is more evident than in the energy sector. From the major oil and gas companies like BP and Shell announcing net zero goals, to government agencies and private companies creating new positions, nonprofits gaining more influence, to entrepreneurs birthing new solutions, and the investors stepping up to fund them, there are plenty of new ways to think about your career today. And more shifts are on the way, as companies, institutions and countries gear up to seize opportunities in the new U.S. infrastructure bills and to meet commitments made at the big UN Climate Conference known as COP26 starting on November 1. Various career paths graphic Pixaby MORE FOR YOU Spring Health Notches A $190 Million Series C At A $2 Billion Valuation, Making CEO April Koh The Youngest Woman To Run A Unicorn A Year After Unleashing War Crimes Against Indigenous Armenians, Azerbaijan’s Threats And Violations Continue The Secret To Being The Wildly Popular Mayor Of Miami? Surround Yourself With Amazing Latina Women So, where do you fit in amidst these changes? What’s the best way to think about a career in energy today – especially as a woman in such a traditionally male-dominated field that’s being completely reinvented? It may be hard to get your footing or to know exactly where you add value in all the chaos. Since energy companies and utilities cannot close for renovation like a restaurant can, this massive pivot is happening while they keep the power flowing. That makes it both exciting and confusing. It also opens up opportunities. Kathryn Pavlovsky, head of Deloitte's Energy, Resources & Industrials practice Deloitte As Kathryn Pavlovsky , head of Deloitte’s Energy, Resources and Industrials practice, told me on my Electric Ladies podcast recently, “What I am finding is that the pandemic has motivated women to appreciate their experiences, the contribution that they can make going forward, and whether they are currently in the best position to be driving forward with those.” She and her colleague on the other side of the energy spectrum, Kristen Sullivan , head of Deloitte’s Sustainability and Supply Chain Compliance, gave valuable insight into how to think about your next career move. “The ecosystem is evolving.” Here are five advice highlights from these top women: · “What is the role that women can play in particular? ”: Pavlovsky asks this provocative question. “Even within energy and on the topics of environmental, social, and governance, what is the role that women can play in particular, in moving forward that agenda and driving earlier results?” Studies have found that women focus on making a difference with their work more than men do. Women leaders want status and power, and also are want their curiosity and their idealism nurtured. As both Pavlovsky and Sullivan point out, the shift to ESG – the environment, social and governance Pavlovsky referenced – enables women to work in energy and serve their idealism, depending upon how they do it. Kristen Sullivan, Deloitte Deloitte · Apply your business competency “through a value-enhancing lens” : Sullivan emphasized something that a lot of people forget is the price of entry to a career: you have to be very good at something. Whether it’s finance, or marketing, or information technology, or human resources, or operations, for example, you need a core competency. Identify what you’re good at and then you can shift by “layering on a different perspective, whether it’s climate risk or societal considerations, to be able to deliver on that traditional competence but at such a higher level, and through that value-enhancing lens.” · How can you do things differently? : Think about “what inspires you” and “what you love to do,” Pavlovsky explained, and then “coupling that with your experiences and then your relationship network,” can help you “think about: ‘how can I do things differently?’” I frame it to my coaching clients as putting the puzzle pieces of their skills, talents and experiences together in a new way to achieve their new goals. (Photo credit should read PAUL RATJE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images · Look at options across geographies : A key shift that Pavlovsky sees in the transition to an ESG-focused economy, and in the energy industry’s “accelerating digital transformation,” is that the energy industry needs new skills . As she put it, “The ecosystem is evolving,” and the need for those new skills opens doors to women and other traditionally under-represented talent, including the option to work remotely. · Find people you want to know : There are likely people in your network, no matter how small it may seem, who know someone who knows someone who can give you insight into the new area you want to explore and help you access new opportunities. Ask, ask, ask! Being shy will not get you what you deserve. Your competency helps you “deliver trust,” as Sullivan framed what Deloitte does, based in the auditor disciplines. Then, applying the values lens, you can ask, “What higher purpose can we have than applying our skills, our training, our competence to…drive value into the future?” Listen to Joan’s full interviews on Electric Ladies podcast with Kathryn Pavlovsky here and with Kristen Sullivan here .",

The Nasdaq Composite ( NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC ) was the only index not to close at a record high, but it posted the biggest gains, while the S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) managed to set new records even with more modest increases on Monday. Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow Jones Industrials +0.18% +64 S&P 500 +0.47% +22 Nasdaq Composite +0.90% +137 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Yet many investors are watching other parts of the market even more closely. In particular, cryptocurrencies have been doing extremely well lately, with Bitcoin ( CRYPTO:BTC ) leading the way higher and climbing into record territory above $60,000. That's been good news for a host of crypto stocks whose business models rely on a healthy cryptocurrency market, and the company that is seeing the biggest positive impact recently is Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ:COIN ) . With the crypto exchange giant finally starting to see some more excitement return to the Bitcoin market, Coinbase has jumped to its best levels since right after its IPO, and many are hoping that it can continue to build on its recent gains. Below, we'll put Coinbase's gains into context and see whether it can keep up its momentum. A rising tide lifts all ships Interestingly, the latest surge for Coinbase came arguably from news that a competing method of owning cryptocurrencies was now available. Last week, a new exchange-traded fund gave investors a way to participate in the Bitcoin market. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( NYSEMKT:BITO ) focuses on Bitcoin futures contracts, choosing not to take direct custody of Bitcoin itself in favor of relying on derivative securities. Yet Coinbase has been working hard to defend its business model and demonstrate its superiority. Last week, the company announced partnerships with Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) and the National Basketball Association, with the goal of increasing visibility of crypto applications and supporting payments that use digital currencies. Image source: Getty Images. Perhaps most importantly, Coinbase stands to benefit whenever Bitcoin and other crypto tokens see greater adoption, because it offers ancillary services like institutional custody. For instance, on Monday, shares of Bakkt Holdings ( NYSE:BKKT ) more than tripled after Mastercard ( NYSE:MA ) announced that it would work with the digital asset platform , as well as payment tech specialist Fiserv ( NASDAQ:FISV ) to make it easier to integrate fiat currency-based and digital asset-based payments. Again, even though Bakkt is arguably a direct competitor to Coinbase, investors seem quite happy with the progress that the crypto industry has made in persuading mainstream financial giants to move forward with cryptocurrency adoption. Will Coinbase reach its full potential? Even with the roughly $100-per-share gains that Coinbase has enjoyed since the beginning of October, the stock remains well below its highs. The stock came public in April and quickly jumped to nearly $430 per share before rapidly falling back. For quite a while, Coinbase traded below its initial reference price, reflecting some doubts about its core trading business. In the near term, Coinbase will indeed have to demonstrate that its trading platform is viable and can generate sustainable fee income. Yet if the company can make a transition toward bringing in other types of revenue, it could go a long way toward demonstrating Coinbase's first-mover advantage in the space. To succeed, Coinbase will have to keep innovating, and that could mean that the company will have to spend more on research and development in order to stay ahead. But in the long run, if the cryptocurrency market stays at the cutting edge of financial technology, then Coinbase has the opportunity to prove its leadership chops -- and that could send it back to its IPO-day levels in time.",

Welcome to the Bank of Hawaii Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Janelle Higa. Please go ahead. Janelle Higa -- Vice President of Investor Relations Thank you, Carmen, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On the call with me this morning is our Chairman, President and CEO, Peter Ho; our Chief Financial Officer, Dean Shigemura; and our Chief Risk Officer, Mary Sellers. Before we get started, let me remind you that today's conference call will contain some forward-looking statements. And while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, there are a variety of reasons that actual results may differ materially from those projected. During the call, we'll be referencing a slide presentation as well as the earnings release. A copy of the presentation and release are available on our website, boh.com, under Investor Relations. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Ho. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Great. Thank you, Janelle. Good morning, everybody, or good afternoon. I'll lead off with a little commentary on what's happening here in the Hawaii marketplace, I'll then as is our custom turn the call over to Dean, who will fill you in on the financials for the quarter, generally a pretty clean, good quarter for us, and then he'll turn the call over to Mary to touch on credit items and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So, leading off, talk a little bit about the economy here in the islands that hit pretty hard late in the summer with the Delta variant and our forecast is over Bureaucracy [Phonetic] of Hawaii really had anticipated pretty meaningful impact to employment in the state and we were actually kind of surprised to see unemployment come out just recently at 6.6%. So continued positive downward trending in unemployment here in the State. Like I said, a bit of a surprise. And then we go to the next page. I think what's happening is the 9/20 forecast, you see an elevated level of forecast unemployment for '22 and '23. We'll see what happens in the next forecast, but at this point looking like employments is in a bit of a better space than what we had -- what we were all thinking coming out of our most recent Delta surge. Turning to the real estate market. Like many places in the country, it's not in the world actually, real estate continues to be hot. Sales prices -- median sales prices for single-family homes up 19%, up 7.4% for condominiums, that September on September, and then inventory levels continue to trend downwards. So inventory levels for single-family homes here in the islands are now or here on Oahu actually are now down 1.2 months and 1.8 months for condominiums. Daily arrivals, really visitors into our marketplace. I think that this is an interesting chart. It shows a couple of things here. What it shows is the ramp-up, if you will in in visitor count into the islands really was on a pretty nice trajectory for most of 2021, right up until about July, you see from the chart that we have up here that basically we had comp'd back to 2019 levels by the end of July. And mind you, that was accomplished really with only one of our two primary markets in place. So lots of supply in from the -- from the North American market, mainly the United States, both East and West coasters. And really not much in the way of demand in from Asia as that marketplace continued to work through its vaccine and infection protocols. Then the delta hit and a number of policies put in place and a pretty meaningful downturn in visitor traffic, you see post -- like kind of post August. So we're in a bit of a repositioning phase I think at this point. It feels like and talking to some of the hoteliers in town that the winter should be a pretty good season for us again. And so I think absent any recurring surge here in the islands or nationally speaking, I think we should be in for kind of resumption of that upward trend in arrivals, but we'll see -- we'll see how this all plays out. Switching to the COVID situation. I mentioned we went through a pretty meaningful spate with the Delta variant in the late -- kind of mid late summer. Things have gotten quite a bit better here in the islands. So you see here on this chart that we're trending toward the bottom of the country in terms of number of infections, which is a good thing. And then as it relates to vaccination rates, we're now at 70, almost 71% of the total population we've vaccinated. That's a very good number I think by national standards. And I think the interesting number is that if you look at the number, the percentage of people vaccinated here in the islands that are eligible to be vaccinated, that number is now actually into the 90 plus percent range. And so, hopefully, we'll see if the under 12-year-old population gets authorization to be vaccinated. Assuming that happens, I think we would anticipate a very, very high percentage of our local, State of Hawaii population to be vaccinated in the not too distant future. So, I'll stop there and turn the call over to Dean, who will update you on our financials for the quarter. Dean? Dean Y. Shigemura -- Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Peter. Growth on core customers remained solid in the third. Core loans net of PPP waivers increased by $276 or 2.4% linked quarter and $542 million year-over-year or 4.8%. Waivers on PPP loans have accelerated and balances declined by $245 million in the quarter. Our strong deposit growth continue. Core customer and operating account balances grew by $613 million linked quarter. Offsetting this growth was a reduction in non-core public time deposits of $289 million. As a result, total deposits increased by $324 million or 1.6% linked quarter and $2.8 billion or 16% year-over-year. Our strong and stable deposit base remains a readily available source of liquidity for continued growth in income. Excess liquidity is being deployed in high quality, low-risk investments that can easily be converted into funding if needed, while providing current income and mitigating margin pressures. Our balance sheet asset sensitivity positions us well for rising rates and greater net interest income. Our strong core deposits and low loan to deposit ratio of 59% will allow us to lag rate increases, while maintaining a significant funding source for continued growth. Our mix of floating and adjustable rate loans, ample monthly cash flow and cash balances represent significant flexibility and greater income potential in a rising rate environment. Net income for the third quarter was $62.1 million and earnings per common share was $1.52. Net interest income in the third quarter was $126.8 million, up 2.7% linked quarter and up 2.1% from the third quarter of 2020. Included in the third and second quarters net interest income were $5.9 million and $3.8 million respectively of accelerated loan fees from PPP loan waivers. Adjusting for PPP loan forgiveness, the third quarter's net interest income increased by $1.2 million or 1% linked quarter as a lingering impact from lower interest rates, was offset by strong core loan growth and deployment of liquidity. We expect these trends to continue and expect core net interest income will increase by approximately 2% in the fouth quarter, excluding the PPP loan waivers. As Mary will discuss later, we recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $10.4 million this quarter. Noninterest income totaled $41.4 million in the third quarter compared with a reported $44.4 million in the second quarter. Included in the second quarter were gains of $3.7 million from the sale of investment securities. Adjusted for these gains, the third quarter non-interest income increased by approximately 700,000 from higher deposit fees and swap transaction fees. We expect noninterest income will increase to approximately $42 million in the fourth quarter from increasing deposit fees, service charges and other transaction fees as we emerge from the negative impact from the delta variant and further reopening of the economy. Non-interest expense in the third quarter totaled $96.5 million, approximately unchanged from the second quarter. The third quarter's expenses included charges of $3.8 million related to the early termination of repurchase agreements and $1.2 million of severance expenses. These were offset by a $6.3 million benefit from the sale of property. The termination of the repos allowed us to reduce our non-core funding, free up capital and increase net interest income. Adjusting for these items, expenses were higher by $1.3 million linked quarter, primarily due to a very successful marketing program initiated during the quarter that contributed to the quarter's strong loan growth. The strong loan growth also led to an increase in variable expenses. The marketing and variable expenses represented $1.2 million of the linked quarter expense increase. Expenses are projected to be between $98 million at $99 million for the fourth quarter or approximately $391 million on a reported basis and $388 million adjusted for onetime items for the full year. When evaluating our expenses over a longer period and comparing with the full year 2021 estimate to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, we continue to demonstrate expense discipline. Expenses on a reported basis increased at an annualized rate of 1.5%, which was well below the rate of inflation of 2.4%. More importantly, our current expense levels and normalized expense run rate already include expenses related to the significant innovation investments that are resulting in balance sheet growth and core expense efficiencies. In 2019, the level of our investment spending has increased by $17 million and we are realizing annual savings of $8 million. Our return on assets during the third quarter was 1.07%, the return on common equity was 17.08%, and our efficiency, excuse me, our efficiency ratio was 57.38%. Our net interest margin in the third quarter was 2.32%, a decline of 5 basis points from the second quarter. The decline in the margin in the third quarter reflects the ongoing impact from the strong deposit growth, partially offset by core loan growth, deployment of liquidity and PPP loan waiver. Excluding the impact of further PPP loan waivers, we expect the margin will increase by low single-digits in the fourth quarter over the third quarter, primarily due to continued loan growth and stable interest rates. Our capital levels remain strong and will position -- and will position to support continued growth. Our CET1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 12.02% and 14.72% respectively, with a healthy excess over the minimum well capitalized requirements. During the third quarter, we paid out $28 million or 46% of net income available to common shareholders and dividends and $1 million in preferred stock dividends. We repurchased 241,000 shares of common stock for a total of $20 million, and finally our Board declared a dividend of $0.70 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary E. Sellers -- Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer Thank you, Dean. Customer loan balances on deferral are down 95% from their peak to 0.8% of total loans. As you recall, we elected to partner with our customers through this unprecedented event to provide additional relief, primarily through principal deferrals on low margin real estate. A 100% of the loans remaining on deferral are secured with our consumer deferrals having a weighted average loan to value of 70% and our commercial deferrals having a weighted average loan to value of 37%. A 100% of the commercial loans on deferral continue to pay interest, and our return to payment performance remained strong with less than 1% of these customers delinquent 30 days or more. Credit metrics remained strong and stable in the second quarter. Net charge-offs were $1.2 million or 4 basis points flat for the linked period. Non-performing assets were $20.6 million or 17 basis points, up 1 basis point from the second quarter. Loans delinquent 30 days or more were $28.3 million or 23 basis points at the end of the quarter, down 2 basis points for the linked quarter. And criticized loan exposure totaled 2.34% of total loans, up 17 basis points for the quarter. As Dean noted, we recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $10.4 million. This included a negative provision to the allowance for credit losses of $11.3 million, which with net charge-offs of $1.2 million, reduced the allowance to $167 million, 1.39% of total loans and leases or 1.42% net of PPP balances. The decrease in the allowance reflects the most recent UHERO economic outlook and forecast where market and forecast for our market coupled with our credit risk profile. The allowance does continue to provide for the uncertainty and potential downside risk inherent with the pandemic. I'll now turn the call back to Janelle. Janelle Higa -- Vice President of Investor Relations Thank you, Mary. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to answer any questions you may thank you. Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Andrew Liesch -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hi, good morning, everyone. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Liesch -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst So, I'd talk on the margin guide here to be up slightly, does that include any improvement in the earning asset mix? You continue to have pretty good deposit inflows, just kind of curious how you see the -- the level of cash shifting around here? Dean Y. Shigemura -- Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I think the -- the guidance assumes a little bit of balance sheet growth and as well as continued loan growth and a little bit more of investing of the excess liquidity. So that's how we got to the -- Hawaii got to the number. Andrew Liesch -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Okay, got it. It looks like you've, over the last few quarters you've been pretty, I wouldn't say aggressive, but you've been consistent with adding the securities portfolio. So is that still the plan? And I guess the statements of the yield curve are even more inclined to add to the book. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer We are, but Keep in mind that the way we've handled the investment portfolio in the past is, it's really because it's a kind of a storage of liquidity for us, we tend to adjust the balances based on deposit and loan growth. So it would kind of be the net outcome from both of those lines. Andrew Liesch -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. And then on the expense front with your guide of $98 million to $99 million, is that a good run rate to you going into next year, but then maybe layering on some merit increases and then the seasonal payroll taxes in the first quarter? Dean Y. Shigemura -- Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer It will serve as a base. We do have those items that you mentioned, but we intend to continue to make strategic investments especially in our innovation kind of area like we've seen in the past. Andrew Liesch -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Got it. Okay, very helpful. Thanks for taking the question. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Andrew. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Jeff Rulis -- D. A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst Thanks, good morning. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Jeff. Jeff Rulis -- D. A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst Question for, maybe for Mary, and I don't want to get too into the weeds here, but trying to get a sense of that provision recapture, my guess is the provision and reserve levels are more led by like unemployment projections corrected versus less about what you're actually seeing the 66% number that you quoted. But, is that correct that it's more on the projections that leads that number? Mary E. Sellers -- Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer Yes, absolutely. Jeff Rulis -- D. A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst Okay. And so I guess, intuitively if projections more closely align with lower actuals we could read that continued to recapture is possible I suppose, it's oversimplified, but... Mary E. Sellers -- Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer You've got it. Jeff Rulis -- D. A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst Okay, Got it. All right. Thank you. And Peter, just on the loan growth side, I mean it continues to be very strong, I think in quarters past you've done -- you've done a thorough job of sort of pegging by segment, where you think you have some tailwind, some that might have some some headwinds. So just if you wouldn't mind kind of rattling through the book and where you see in terms of not only Q4, but '22 where where you're optimistic and where some areas that might come? Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So we had good growth in both commercial as well as consumer on a core basis, Jeff. C&I, actually if you net out the PPP out of C&I, that was up 5.4% on a linked basis for the quarter, really driven by -- we've made some, some great investments in people over the past couple of years and those individuals have helped us build market share and in a few markets -- some markets here in the islands. So I think C&I has an opportunity to grow into '22, probably not at the 5% linked level, but a reasonably healthy growth rate there. CRE was up 1.7% in the quarter on a linked basis and we think -- we think there is a good amount of room in that space as well, both in our granular, what we call our fast track product which is smaller commercial mortgages to smaller investors and mom and pop types, but also in the institutional space. I think clearly the market has recognized the durability of Hawaii assets at the institutional level and we're seeing kind of renewed interest after taking a pause through the pandemic. Construction, I think should be strong as well, that was up pretty nicely in the quarter and really led by hopefully affordable housing output because that is -- we certainly need that here in this marketplace. Switching over to the consumer side, resi was was about flat for the quarter on a linked basis, production was down about 30% as rates as rate started to pick up. But the good news is that was offset by really great production in just about all of our other consumer categories, so HELOC was up very smartly, indirect even was up despite the inventory challenges of that -- of that industry, and our other consumer which is basically instalment was up $36 million or just under 10% for the quarter on a linked basis, really driven by -- we kind of restarted that program as we took a bit, pulled back a bit on that programing through the pandemic. And so I think -- I think that was, that created some pent-up demand in the book, but still a very good result. And I think the other interesting thing on the consumer side is we're seeing a good uptake in our digital channels. So 18% percent of our production for the quarter was through our digital channels, up 62% year-on-year. Jeff Rulis -- D. A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst Okay, appreciate it. A lot of details, sounds pretty, pretty good momentum into '22, I suppose. Maybe one last one, just, Dean, and maybe it's Dean's question. Just the PPP, could we kind of assume that's largely cleaned up by year end, is that -- is that fair to say? Dean Y. Shigemura -- Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, we expect the fourth quarter to pay off most of what's remaining. But we also do expect some might carry over, but not that material amount. Jeff Rulis -- D. A. Davidson & Company -- Analyst Great. Okay, thank you. Dean Y. Shigemura -- Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, take care. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Laurie Hunsicker with a complex Compass Point. Please go ahead. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Yeah, hi. Thanks, good morning. Can you just refresh us on how much in PPP fees are actually remaining? Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, we have approximately $7.7 million remaining. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Okay. And then I just want to make sure I heard you right, it was $5.9 million that was reflected in this quarter. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer That was the accelerated fees. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Right, the forgiveness. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Right. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Okay, OK, so if I'm -- if I'm stripping that out, so your margin then was 221 relative to 230 [Phonetic] ex PPP gains last quarter. I guess, can you help us think a little bit about your your comments about potential margin widening and also maybe the FHLB borrowings that were prepaid in the quarter, when were they repaid and how much and what were those costings? Thanks. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Okay, let me take that second one first on the repos. It was toward the end of the quarter, the approximate rate was about 2.6% -- 2.4%, sorry, 2.4%. And then the -- in terms of the margin, I think I get to the same numbers that you did on the PPP waivers. Liquidity impacted us quarter over quarter by about 11 basis points and then our growth and deployment of assets added back about 2 basis points. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Okay, great. And then just one last question around that. Do you anticipate doing any borrowing prepays in the coming quarter? Or how are you thinking about that? Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer I think it will depend on the situation. I mean, we've done these opportunistically. When it look positive from various fronts, we will do it. But right now I guess nothing planned here for the quarter. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Okay, great. And then, sorry, just two more ones from me. Just want to make sure I got this right. So the preferred this quarter was $1.006 million, next quarter we'll see the full impact, that will be $1.969 million, am I doing the math on that right? Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, for the fourth quarter you will see approximately $2 million in preferred dividends. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst $2 million, Okay, perfect. And then just last one from me. How should we think about tax rate going forwards? Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer For the fourth quarter estimate is about 24%. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Okay. And what about for next year, ex whatever is happening in Washington, how should we think about that? Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer I think for now 24% is also a good number. Laurie Havener Hunsicker -- Compass Point -- Analyst Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. Peter S. Ho -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Laurie. Operator Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions. Janelle Higa -- Vice President of Investor Relations Okay. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Bank of Hawaii. Please feel to contact me if you have any additional questions or need further clarifications on any of the topics discussed today. Thank you, everyone.

    "full_description": "Latch ( NASDAQ:LTCH ) specializes in smart lock technology. Its platform modernizes the entry experience across a range of real estate, creating a connected ecosystem that simplifies access and security for tenants and property managers alike. In this Backstage Pass video, recorded on Oct. 14, 2021 , Motley Fool contributors Trevor Jennewine and Matthew Frankel, CFP, explain what differentiates Latch from other players in the industry. And they discuss what investors should watch when Latch delivers its third-quarter earnings report, expected on Nov. 9. Trevor Jennewine: Latch is a smart lock company, for anybody that's not familiar. It really started with apartment buildings and has recently expanded into commercial office spaces. And at the core of its ecosystem is LatchOS, which is the operating system that powers a variety of first-party devices like door-mounted access controls, intercoms, cameras. LatchOS also integrates with third-party smart home devices, so the company really has a full building end-to-end solution for smart buildings. That includes software and hardware, which I think differentiates it from a lot of the other players in the space. I'm pretty excited about this company. On the resident side, you can use your mobile app to unlock doors, manage visitors, control connected devices like smart thermostats and lights switches. Then, on the other side of the equation, property managers benefit by being able to remotely control access permissions. And having this technology creates a premium experience, so management mentioned in the SEC filings that Latch technology tends to boost revenue by $200 to $500 per apartment per year; and it reduces maintenance expenses by $100 to $300 per apartment per year. You can see a picture over on the right-hand side of the slide. Just one of their smart locks looks like. They're these sleek little devices. Taking a look at quarter two. Latch just went public by way of SPAC just a few months ago. Since going public, the share price has dropped about nine percent or so, and they are expected to report their earnings on the 12th of November. Last quarter revenue was nine million dollars, that was up 227%. Total bookings was almost $96 million and I was up over 100%. Total bookings just refers to non-binding agreements that haven't been recognized as revenue. Then one other highlight from the second quarter was management announced that they now have partnerships with the top three electronic property management software vendors. This really streamlines things for building staff and property managers. It allows them to pull data like resident names, contact information, lease start dates from that system and it automatically updates it in Latch manager, which is the company's Cloud-based software that allows staff to control access remotely. Looking at the next quarter, management's expecting revenue of $10 million to $11 million, and that would be up 116% at the high-end. Total bookings, $90 million, up over 164%. Still operating at a loss. Adjusted EBITDA, negative $32 million. But the company has plenty of cash on its balance sheet and no long-term debt, and so it can't afford to burn cash for a while. Then, as far as management's commentary, I mentioned they just expanded their ecosystem into the commercial office space and they've had a lot of success in the apartment spaces. I think about 10% of new apartments in the United States are built with Latch technology. So, they're entering a new market. I want to see if management has any updates on how that process is going. You guys have any thoughts on Latch? Matt Frankel: I love they're pivot office because when last one public, first of all, they were really residential company. They still are. The company that took them public by SPAC is Tishman Speyer , which is one of the biggest office landlords in the country. They're in charge of Rockefeller Center, for example. Latch just got its products into the empire state building, so I know they're having some success on that front. The revenue numbers really minuscule, but the bookings are the more important one. You're not going to see profitability until more of the bookings, which represent the software revenue, turn into actual revenue, which right now is mostly hardware, which Latch is losing money from. I'm excited about that one too.",

So what Exela said that the unnamed franchisor will use its digital mailroom (DMR) service to allow remote employees to access company data securely and quickly. Image source: Getty Images. According to Exela, its DMR is a user-configurable document management system that digitizes mail and other documents, making them easily shareable, searchable, and secure. \"DMR's comprehensive feature set enabled us to sign one of the most recognizable logos on the globe,\" said Exela President Suresh Yannamani in a press release. Now what Exela has more than 4,000 customers in 50 countries, so the idea that one new unnamed customer could move the needle so much for the stock in just a day is a bit surprising. But its share price has been extremely volatile, which may help explain Monday's massive move. Year to date, the stock is up by about 85%, but it's off by 47% since mid-July. Given its recent history of sharp and wild share price swings, investors may want to tread lightly with Exela stock, even if it is significant that it has added a major new client to its roster.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Bill Cimino. Mr. Cimino, you have the floor. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone.

All comments made during today's call are subject to that safe harbor statement. And at the end of the call, we will take questions from the research analyst community. And now, I will turn the call over to John Asbury. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Thank you, Bill, and thanks to all for joining us today. Reflecting on the big picture over the third quarter, we were pleased to see reason for optimism in the outlook for COVID-19, declining unemployment and the most benign credit environment I've witnessed in my 34-year career. On the other hand, supply chain disruptions continued unabated, pressures on wages and the ability of our business clients to fill open positions remained a challenge, and we don't expect any improvement in the short-term rate environment for perhaps another year. Having said that, our business clients are holding up well, and most report strong demand for their services, but are challenged in fulfilling orders due to the scarcity of needed inventories, supplies and equipment. The good news is this is a supply problem, it's not a demand problem and the supply challenges should improve in the coming quarters. While the economic outlook may have been muted somewhat by these factors, it's still a positive outlook, and we remain decidedly in an optimistic camp. All of this has pros and cons for us with the pros being the absence of credit problems in what appears to be a coiling spring for loan growth and the cons being surplus liquidity, elevated loan pay-downs and wage pressures. The decline in loan balances we experienced over the quarter was more than we expected. It was in fact a record level of payoffs as stabilized commercial real estate were sold or refinanced into the long-term institutional markets and surplus liquidity was used by clients to pay down bank debt. We are encouraged by the outlook for loan growth though as new loan production was the highest we've seen in any quarter, year-to-date, and new construction loans set a record high. However, initial fundings were not enough to offset payoffs. In closing, it should have been higher still were it not for the project delays we've been seeing all year long. We do believe we are set up for a solid finish in Q4 with quarterly loan growth looking good month-to-date, and I will elaborate more on that momentarily. I typically begin and end my comments on these calls with familiar statements, and I do that intentionally to demonstrate consistency in our strategy and how we run the business. So I'll do that again now. Our mantra of soundness, profitability and growth in that order of priority serves us well and continues to inform how we run the Company. A sound bank is and will remain our single highest priority. A prudent and conservative credit culture served the Company well during the great recession and it's serving us well in the current environment as evidenced by our credit quality, which remains pristine. Our second priority is profitability, and we did incur added expense to maintain competitiveness in the current labor environment, particularly for our retail branch network. We also had some one-time expenses related to both hiring and severance. We continue to balance investment and the business for the long term, while remaining mindful of the continuing challenges of the low rate environment. The expense control will be of supreme importance for as far as the eye can see. It's very clear, wage pressures are real, and we'll mitigate this through additional expense actions. With the noise of PPP and provision releases subsiding, we now have enough line of sight to 2022 to reestablish our top-tier financial targets as we said we do. Rob will walk you through the details on that during his section. As for growth, we remain optimistic in our economic outlook, and we believe we have a long runway ahead of us to grow both organically and through takeaway from our larger competitors that dominate market share in our home state of Virginia supplemented by our operations in Maryland, North Carolina and our specialized lending capabilities in government contract finance and equipment finance. We are focused on and believe we're benefiting from the disruption occurring at two of our largest competitors. As mentioned, elevated commercial real estate payoffs and commercial and industrial line paydowns were the headline for loan balances in Q3. Loans, excluding the impact of PPP averaged down 0.6% over the course of the quarter, and that's approximately 1.3% point to point due to CRE payoffs having been the highest we've experienced to [Phonetic] stabilize properties were sold or refinanced and to the long-term, non-recourse and institutional markets and C&I borrowers continue to pay down bank debt with surplus liquidity. C&I line utilization ticked down 3 percentage points to 25% and should be about bottomed out. As mentioned, while production was strong, initial fundings were not enough to overcome outsized paydowns last quarter. October has busy to date, and we have recaptured more than half of the reported third quarter loan balance decline in our commercial loan portfolio, excluding PPP. Bookings should continue to be active in the seasonally strong Q4, and we expect to close out the year with good loan growth. Whilst we're encouraged that construction lending activity has been rising for some time and construction loans outstanding grew over the quarter, first-time we've seen that for a while, construction loan and new commitments dropped significantly in the first half of 2020 with the onset of COVID, and we're missing two quarters of normalized funding ramp up from them. Construction lending rebounded beginning in Q3 '20, has been running strong since then and set a record level in Q3'21. Borrowers first need to burn through their equity as projects proceed before making drawdowns on their financing, and while this has been a very strong headwind throughout 2021, it does set up a nice tailwind in 2022 for loan growth. Traditionally, we can offset CRE paydowns with construction fundings, but have not been able to do so this year due to the combination of new construction loans having been suppressed much of last year, and historically high pay-offs. As I mentioned before, the headwind is now abating as construction loans are funding up and growing. Based on what we see at this time, we're expecting more normalized loan growth in the fourth quarter and in 2022 as our pipeline strength expanded lending capabilities, new hires, market dynamics and economic outlook to support that opportunity. We do believe we're on a growth footing. PPP loan forgiveness during the third quarter was steady, approximately 3,000 clients from both round one and round two received forgiveness totaling approximately $392 million during the quarter, bringing the total amount forgiven to date to approximately $1.7 billion. Our current PPP balances are $482 million. Overall, the PPP loan forgiveness process is running smoothly, and this should largely wrap up over the next two quarters. Turning to credit. The headline here remains the absence of credit problems. As we continue to climb out of the systemic downturn, our credit losses have been minimal so far. Impressively, for the second consecutive quarter, charge offs netted to zero basis points. Realistically though, at some point, credit losses will normalize. But given all the liquidity that remains in the system, declining unemployment and a strengthening economy, we see no sign of a systemic inflection point, and all of that feels distant to us. And to that point, the economic outlook remains positive, and we're optimistic. Here in our home state of Virginia, September unemployment came in at 3.8%, down from 4.3% in June and that was 1 percentage point better than the national average of 4.8%. While that's all good news, the employment challenge in our markets is not the unemployment rate, it's the ability of businesses to fill their open jobs. Rob will talk you through the provision for credit losses in our CECL modeling, but by all indications and metrics, credit appears to have never been better. The past year challenged us in new and unexpected ways, bringing out our best to meet the unprecedented needs of our customers and teammates. And as I said before, we've come out on the other side as a stronger and more capable organization. Also, as I've said before, we've learned to work differently and our customers have learned to bank differently. We've seen usage in our digital channels increase substantially. For example, year-to-date approximately 17% of new checking accounts originated online; 28% of savings accounts originated online and 9% of consumer loans originated online. We expect to further drive these numbers up, as we continue to refine our digital offerings and capabilities. Digital log-ins are up 23% since this time last year with 76% of those log-ins coming from a mobile device. Mobile check deposit utilization continues to grow, and now accounts for 19% of our deposit transactions. And, Zelle users are up 71% year-over-year, with more than 49,000 users, and transaction dollar amounts are up 176%. We continue to work on new projects and improve the omnichannel customer experience with quarterly releases and upgrades to our product offerings. During the third quarter of the year, our most significant accomplishments in major undertakings were having completed the transition to a universal banker model in our branch network. This is a big structural change, and that enabled us to update our pay scales to remain competitive, while also making branch staffing more efficient and productive. While this did increase our salary expense run rate in Q3, it's a good example of an investment; one, that makes us more productive, efficient and scalable over the long run. We added a new commercial team to our Maryland operations. And we finalized plans in our equipment finance division to launch a new specialty vehicle financing team in the fourth quarter that further expands our growing specialty financing strategies. Looking ahead, our goal remains to achieve and maintain top-tier financial performance regardless of the operating environment, as evidenced by our newly reestablished financial targets. We will continue to work on ways to make the Company more efficient and scalable while improving and automating processes and the customer experience. We should see operating leverage results, as -- coming from this. I remain convinced we are emerging from the pandemic stronger, better and more efficient than before, and that will give us opportunities both organic and possibly through M&A [Phonetic]. We are leveraging our learnings and ingraining our newfound capabilities, agility and innovation into the Company's culture, so that we're flexible and adaptable in the current lower for longer rate environment and forthcoming post pandemic next normal, while also delivering a differentiated customer experience. I also remain confident in what the future holds for us and the potential we have to deliver long-term, sustainable performance for our customers, communities, teammates and shareholders. And of course, I'll close with my customary reminder that Atlantic Union Bankshares remains a uniquely valuable franchise, dense and compact in great markets with a story unlike any other in a region. We are scalable with the right capabilities, the right markets and the right team to deliver high performance even in the most trying of times. I'll now turn the call over to Rob to cover the financial results for the quarter. Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well, thank you, John and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Now let's turn to the Company's financial results for the third quarter. In the third quarter, reported net income available to common shareholders was $71.6 million and earnings per share per common share was $0.94, down approximately $10.8 million or $0.11 per common share from the second quarter. The non-GAAP pre-tax, pre-provision earnings were $72.1 million, which was down from $77 million in the prior quarter. For the third quarter, Return on equity was 10.9%, the non-GAAP return on tangible common equity was 18.8%. Return on assets came in at 1.47%, and the operating efficiency ratio was 53.91%. Turning to credit loss reserves as of the end of the third quarter, the total allowance for credit losses was $109 million, comprised of the allowance for loan and lease losses of $102 million, and the reserve for unfunded commitments of $7.5 million. In the third quarter, the total allowance for credit losses declined by $19 million primarily due to lower expected losses than previously estimated as a result of economic improvements in our footprint, benign credit quality metrics to date, risk rating upgrades during the quarter, and an improved macroeconomic outlook over the forecast period. The total allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 83 basis points at the end of September, which was down from 94 basis points in the prior quarter. Excluding SBA guaranteed PPP loans, the total allowance for credit losses as a percentage of adjusted loans decreased 14 basis points to 86 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder, our Day 1 CECL reserve came in at 75 basis points. The $19 million decline to the Company's total allowance for credit losses took into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic impact on credit losses, both through the two-year reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecast, utilizing the Company's quantitative CECL model, and through management's qualitative adjustments. Beyond the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, the CECL quantitative model estimates expected credit losses using a reversion to the meaning of Company's historical loss rates on a straight-line basis over two years. In estimating expected credit losses within the loan portfolio at quarter end, the Company utilized Moody's September baseline macroeconomic forecast for the two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. Moody's September baseline economic forecast for Virginia which covers the majority of our footprint has improved from the June baseline forecast as it now assumes that the Virginia unemployment rate will average 2.7% over the two-year forecast period, which is down from the 3.2% two-year average state unemployment rate assumed in the June baseline forecast. On a national level, the September baseline forecast now assumes GDP will increase by 6% in 2021 and 4.3% in 2022. In addition to quantitative modeling, the Company has also made qualitative adjustments for certain industries viewed as being highly impacted by COVID-19. Additional economic scenarios were considered as part of the qualitative framework, in order to capture the economic uncertainty and concerns related to the path of the virus, vaccination distribution efforts and the potential for other more unfavorable economic developments. The negative provision for credit losses of $18.8 million in the third quarter was lower than the prior quarter's negative provision for credit losses of $27.4 million, and represents a decline of $25.4 million from the $6.6 million positive provision for credit losses recorded in the third quarter of 2020. The decline in the provision for credit losses as compared to the same quarter in 2020 was driven by the benign credit impact since the pandemic began, the significant recovery in the economy since last year, as well as the improvement in the economic forecast utilized in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of September 30th. In the third quarter, net charge-offs were de minimis at $113,000 or less than 1 basis point compared to $69,000 in the prior quarter and $1.4 million or 4 basis points in the third quarter of last year. Now turning to the pre-tax, pre-provision components of the income statement for the third quarter. Tax equivalent net interest income was $140.7 million, which was down $3 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by decline in PPP loan fee accretion interest income from $11.5 million in the second quarter to $9.4 million in the current quarter. Net accretion of purchase accounting adjustments of $4 million added 9 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter which was in line with the 9 basis point impact in the second quarter. The third quarter's tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.12% which is a decline of 11 basis points from the previous quarter as earning asset yields declined by 15 basis points from the second quarter due to the impact of the low interest rate environment on core loan and investment security yields, and the increase in low-yielding cash balances due to excess liquidity, which was partially offset by a 4 basis point decline in the cost of funds from the second quarter. The loan portfolio yield decreased to 3.70% from 3.76% in the second quarter, primarily driven by the impact of core loan yield compression of 10 basis points due to pay-downs of higher yielding loans and lower loan yields on loan renewals and new production. The core loan yield compression was partially offset by the increase in the yield on average PPP loans, which was 6.45% in the third quarter, up from 4.91% in the prior quarter. In addition, earning asset yields declined by approximately 7 basis points from the prior quarter due to elevated levels of excess liquidity held in low-yielding cash equivalents and an additional 2 basis point decline due to lower investment securities portfolio yields resulting from the reinvestment of portfolio cash flows and the deployment of excess liquidity into the investment securities portfolio at lower market rates. The quarterly decrease in the cost of funds to 19 basis points from 23 basis points was primarily driven by 4 basis point decline in the cost of deposits to 14 basis points in the third quarter. Interest-bearing deposit costs declined by 5 basis points to 20 basis points in the third quarter, primarily due to the maturity and repricing of high cost time deposits in the quarter. Non-interest income increased $1.5 million to $30 million in the third quarter, up from $28.5 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by the recapture of $1.1 million worth of unrealized SBIC fund investment losses recorded in the prior quarter in other operating income. In addition, deposit in other service charges increased $591,000, mortgage banking income increased $199,000 and asset management fees were higher by $210,000. These quarterly increases were partially offset by declines in other non-interest income categories, including a decline of approximately $500,000 in bank-owned life insurance income due to life insurance proceeds received in the prior quarter. Non-interest expense decreased $3.3 million to $95.3 million from $92 million in the prior quarter. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily driven by increases in salaries and benefits of $2.8 million, driven by higher salary cost of approximately $1 million as a result of banking pay structure changes and other market-driven salary adjustments made during the third quarter of 2021. In addition, increased performance-based variable incentive comp and profit sharing expenses increased $655,000 and employee-related recruiting severance and other cost increases of approximately $900,000. In addition, other expenses increased by $1.6 million for the quarter, primarily due to OREO and related credit expenses increasing by $1.0 million reflecting the impact of gains on the sale of closed branches which were recorded as a reduction in other expenses in the prior quarter. Non-interest expense increases was partially offset by declines in professional services fees of $616,000. Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2021 also included approximately $200,000 in expenses related to PPP loan forgiveness processing compared to approximately $250,000 expenses in the second quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 18% from 18.3% in the second quarter. For the full year of 2021, we still expect effective tax rate to be in the 17% to 18% range. Turning to the balance sheet. Period-end total assets stood at $19.9 billion at September 30th, which was a decrease of approximately $54 million from June 30th as declining loan balances due to PPP loan forgiveness were partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalent balances due to excess liquidity and by net growth in the investment securities portfolio. At period end, loans held for investment were $13.1 billion inclusive of $467 million in PPP loans, a decrease of $558 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by $392 million in PPP loans that were forgiven during the quarter and declines in commercial loan balances ex-PPP of approximately $165 million. Loan balances excluding PPP loans in the third quarter decreased by $166 million or 5.1% annualized, driven by declines in commercial loan balances of $165 million or 6% annualized as a result of historic levels of paydown activity outpacing loan production levels across the portfolio. Consumer loan balances were flat to second quarter levels driven by a 13.9% annualized growth rate in indirect auto balances, offset by the strategic run-off of third-party consumer loan balances. At the end of September, total deposits stood at $16.6 billion, a slight decline of $37 million or approximately 0.9% annualized from the prior quarter, driven by a decline of $113 million in high cost time deposits. At September 30th, low-cost transaction accounts comprised 56% of total deposit balances which was up from 54% in the second quarter. From a shareholder stewardship and capital management perspective, we remain committed to managing our capital resources prudently as the deployment of capital for an enhancement of long-term shareholder value remains one of our highest priorities. At the end of the third quarter, Atlantic Union Bankshares and Atlantic Union Bank's capital ratios were well above regulatory well capitalized levels. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company paid a common stock dividend of $0.28 per share, which was consistent with the prior quarter and also paid the quarterly dividend of $171.88 on each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock. The Company repurchased 2.3 million shares for $82.7 million in the third quarter which fully utilized its $125 million share repurchase authorization from May 4th, 2021. In total, the Company repurchased 3.4 million shares under the repurchase program since May. We continue to operate in the challenging operating environment, and the impact on revenue growth caused by the lingering effects of the pandemic and the intractable lower for longer interest rate environment are now expected to persist into 2022. However, with the financial impact of the PPP loan program winding down, and the pandemic driven volatility related to expected credit losses and credit loss reserve level subsiding, we are now in a position to reestablish our top-tier financial metric targets to the following: Return on tangible common equity within a range of 13% to 15%; the return on assets in the range of 1.1% to 1.3% and; an efficiency ratio of 53% or lower. Our financial performance targets are dynamic, and are said to be consistently in the top quartile among our peer group, regardless of the operating environment. And at this time, we believe these new targets are reflective of the financial metrics required to achieve top tier financial performance in the current economic environment. In summary, Atlantic Union delivered solid financial results in the third quarter and is well positioned to generate sustainable profitable growth and to build long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bill to open it up for questions from our analyst community. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thank you, Rob. Chris, we're ready for our first caller, please. Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Casey Whitman of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Hi, Casey. Good morning. Casey Whitman -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Maybe we can start with the expenses just because there was a lot of movement this quarter. Rob, can you walk us through what you kind of consider the run rate for expenses over the next quarter or two from that, I think, $95 million that you guys had this quarter? Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Casey, so, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we've actually increased during the quarter the run rate for the Company. And our view is, as we go forward here, we're going to be in the $95 million to $96 million range as a result of the pull forward, if you will, in terms of increased salaries related to both the universal banking operating model we went through this quarter as well as some market salary adjustments that were made in the quarter. So, we do expect that, that will continue as we go forward in the fourth quarter and into 2021. In addition, we're also looking as noted -- as John noted, we've lifted out a couple of teams, one in Maryland, and we're also launching a specialty vehicle financing unit and that's going to increase our run rate a bit. So again, we're looking at $95 million to $96 million run rate going forward. As we look forward though, we are looking at all aspects of managing our expenses, and we're currently going through our budget process for 2022, and our target for growth from that run rate is 1% to 2%. We feel like we've got a lot of opportunity to mitigate any additional expense growth going forward, and that's the current outlook as we speak. We'll obviously update that in the fourth quarter earnings call. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Yeah. I just want to underscore that point. Wage inflation is real. We are investing in the business as we should. But we have to mitigate that. And so there is a reason why we published our go-forward financial targets, and Rob is right, we will manage to the lower net overall expense growth target. Casey Whitman -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Okay. And those financial targets that you put out there, does that assume some help from rates or not? Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer It doesn't. Well, it does expect some help in rates to get to the higher end of the ranges that we put out there. We feel pretty good about ROTCE and return on assets at the lower end of the range in 2022, but expected that should improve throughout the year, next year. In terms of our projections, in terms of rates, we aren't expecting much material increase in the short-term rates, until late next year in the fourth quarter where we think the federal start moving at a quarter point, a quarter [Phonetic] starting in the fourth quarter of next year. But topping out around 1% into 2023. So not a lot of help in terms of the rate environment, but to get to the higher end of those targets, we'd be looking for some help. But again, we don't expect that help from the margin, the net interest income component till 2023 and then beyond that period. Casey Whitman -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Okay, helpful. I'll let someone else jump on. Thank you. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Chris, we're ready for our next caller, please. Operator Thank you. And next we have Catherine Mealor of KBW. Your line is open. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Good morning, Catherine. Catherine Mealor -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. -- Analyst Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to get an update on your outlook for growth. I think John, you mentioned that you think fourth quarter will look better than -- you'll see better growth in the fourth quarter. So what's the -- you think a good target? Do you still think kind of mid-single digit is a range that you could get to as we move into 2022? And then, I guess, as we look toward that -- so, that's -- question one is just on growth. And then question two is just how would you think about other revenue levers that you can pull as we move into next year to try to get as closer to that 53% efficiency target? It feels like a long way from where we are today as we pull out PPP. Is it just any kind of path or things that you're thinking on the revenue side, I think would be helpful to help us get to that number. Thanks. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Yes. Thanks, Catherine. Exactly what happens in Q4 on the loan growth side is mostly going to be a function of just the level of payoffs that we see. We hope that we are bouncing around bottom line [Phonetic] utilization. But I will point out, if you look at production is strong. This was the best production quarter of the year. Construction lending in new production is the highest we've ever seen, and that's really important. So what's happening now is the pump is primed. As I've mentioned, we're missing two vintages of kind of normalized quarters that's Q1 and Q2 of '20 of construction lending funding up. It didn't go to zero, but it was down. That's kind of through the system now. And so we can see the schedules of construction loans funding up. And that plays an important role in offsetting the payoffs. So we see that. We see loans booking. C&I balances quarter over quarter excluding PPP actually weren't down that much. It was $18 million point to point. And so, what that's showing you is that even though line utilization came down, we are landing new clients and we're booking new fundings. So as we look at the pipeline, we feel pretty good about Q4. Exactly what the number will be point to point, it's kind of hard to say, could it be and the -- there sort of normalized low, partly upper single-digit growth rate? Possibly, 5%, 6%, 7% point-to-point something like that, we think based on what we're seeing right now. And then as we get into next year, we think we should be in position to where we ought to be able to accomplish what we would call normalized organic growth, which for us, normalized organic growth traditionally means high single digit. I wouldn't look for 9%. I would look at the lower end of that band. So we think that's possible. So obviously that's a big driver in terms of revenue. As we look at other forms of fee income, the swap business, which is really our largest capital markets item, has been slow this year, because we just haven't seen a whole lot of fundings. And typically, you'll see that often times as loans rollout of the construction bucket into permanent mortgage for developers who choose to keep them. So sometimes they'll swap for three to five years, that sort of thing. We see some of this as a commercial business as well. We're adding new capabilities. We now have a syndications effort where we can originate larger deals, and we have a Head of syndications and we've -- are beginning to book syndication gains that helps us on the margin. We have a new foreign exchange program with a new head of foreign exchange that came out of one of the larger banks, that's comfortable or partly that's familiar with these markets. And that's going to be an incremental revenue add. And of course, we continue to look to other businesses such as wealth management, treasury management, etc. And we're seeing more activity going on. We've seen a rise in terms of the consumer base, we grew net households in the Consumer Bank about 3%, that's actually pretty good. You look at industry averages based on our data, it's less than 1%. So we feel like we've got a bigger book of business. Spending is up, so we're seeing more debit cards. So I guess what I would say to you Catherine is, it's not going to be one thing, other than additional revenue from loan growth. But it's going to be a series of things. And we have some other initiatives that we're working on as well. But at the end of the day, we have to take action to help offset some of the additional salary and benefit cost that we are incurring as a result of this environment. That's just the reality. We can't simply absorb that. And we'll have more to say about that as we come back to you with our Q4 earnings. Do you have anything you'd add? Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I'll just add to that. The efficiency ratio target of 53% or less is probably the most challenging of the metrics in the top tier range as we've set. It's going to be difficult to achieve that in 2022. But as we go and get some help from the rate increases going into '23, we think we've got a path to get there. Our working assumption for next year is ex-PPP to see 5% or 6% growth in net interest income and 8% to 10% in non-interest income, some of which was, as John mentioned, more swap activity, more FX activity and just general increases in deposit service charges and things like that. Catherine Mealor -- Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. -- Analyst Great. Very helpful, thank you so much. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thanks. Catherine. And Chris, we're ready for our next caller, please. Operator Thank you, sir. And next we have David Bishop of Seaport Research. Your line is open. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Good morning, David. David Bishop -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Yeah, good morning gentlemen. Hey, I -- the slide on 6 is pretty -- pretty informative here in terms of the different channels. In terms of opening some of the deposit accounts here, with the targets here. Are those near-term targets, long-term targets? Do you think the checking channel, can that get to even higher level and can that inform [Phonetic] even further winnowing of the branch system over time? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank David, I think that you broke up a little bit, I think your question is that when we show the new account digital activity, their current percentages versus targets, are they near-term or longer term? I would say that those are very near-term. We do have industry data, the benchmarks, call it what you want to call it, mid sized banks, super community banks, we're not allowed to site specifics, but I can tell you we're over indexing, and we feel very good about the ability to continue to drive up usage and we have some new offerings coming on that we can talk about as well including for consumer lending. Maria Tedesco is here, President, anything to add? Our view is that the targets that we've laid out on that slide are short term and...[Speech Overlap]. Maria P. Tedesco -- President of Atlantic Union Bank Absolutely. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank We think we can move from there. Maria P. Tedesco -- President of Atlantic Union Bank Yeah, we completely agree. Not sure I have anything to add. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Okay. David Bishop -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Got it. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank By the way, that does have implications for branch staffing, branch network, etc, as we see more digital adoption. David Bishop -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Got it. And then maybe a few -- a little bit of color in terms of the details for the Maryland team and the new specialty finance group, maybe just talk about the expectations for those two groups. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Certainly. David Ring had a commercial banking this year. Dave, do you want to take that, what's going on in Maryland, as well as what's going on in the equipment finance? David V. Ring -- Executive Vice President & Wholesale Banking Group Executive Sure. We continued to invest in our growth markets, one of which is Maryland, and we've brought over a team that will cover Montgomery County which is a county we did not cover prior to hiring, bringing the team in. So we feel like -- well, number one, they've already produced. Even though they just started three weeks ago, we've already booked $9 million of fundings from that team. So we expect them to be very active. It's a three person team. So our typical production per banker is something in the range of $20 million to $25 million to give you an expectation there. And they've hit the ground running. So we're very happy with that. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank And that's a C&I focus. David V. Ring -- Executive Vice President & Wholesale Banking Group Executive Yeah, and it's all C&I. On the flip side, we have also hired two folks to cover real estate in Maryland. And right now, they've just started. And then on equipment finance, it's been very successful. We're now one of the top 100 largest equipment finance companies whether bank or non-bank by Monitor Magazine. Now, the specialty finance unit is a vertical which will cover shuttle buses that are under contract, coaches under contract and school buses and smaller ticket items. Our average ticket right now is around $6 million per deal with about note size of $1.8 million. And in this business, it will look more like high volume, lower ticket. So a more granular portfolio. So the average ticket would be between $250,000 and $350,000 per. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank So we continue to look for opportunities to extend the capabilities of the equipment finance team, and that helps us both in our footprint and they can also operate out of footprint as well. So that's been a big success for us. We've built that from scratch, and that's a good example of the type of organic growth opportunities that we're interested in. And they also are looking at a really good pipeline. By almost any measure, if you read the data, the outlook for capital equipment investment is very strong. The issue is simply getting the equipment off assembly lines, off ships to the extent that it's imported and getting it in place. Supply chain disruption is an issue, but we feel good about the outlook for equipment finance in '22. David Bishop -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Got it. And then just one final question, obviously the port down in Norfolk is probably a key distribution hub, I know, up in Baltimore they are clearing some of that port traffic containerships pretty quickly. Just curious how the -- any sort of backlogs or supply chain issues or distribution issues that are impacting Norfolk or are they may be benefiting from more supply ship...[Speech Overlap] John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Yeah. As you -- David, as you are probably recalling, I'm on the Board of the Port of Virginia. So, I love having this point of insight. Port of Virginia is the fifth largest container port by volume in the United States, the third largest on the East Coast. There are no backlogs. It's actually one of the most modern ports in the industry based on the investment that's been made. So the good news is, they're able to process pretty much in real time. You're not seeing the number of ships lined up off the shore that you're seeing at other major ports on the East and the West Coast. The limiting factor right now is really the ability to haul containers and whatever the cargo is, once they come off the ship. That's the problem. So from time to time, the railroads are placing embargoes, which means that they won't allow the railcars to be loaded and put on the track because they don't have space. That's a problem, because it's too congested. And it's very difficult if you don't have contract freight haulers, truck lines lined up. It's hard to find capacity to -- for someone to come get the cargo. But they are -- it's a terrific operation, they continue to book record month after record month. Part of what's happening now is we're getting more first point port of call, ship lines coming in. So more ships are coming here as the first stop. And they're doing that because they don't have to go wait in line somewhere else. And so that's good for us. It has lots of implications for logistics. The biggest problem we have to be able to take advantage of that here in Virginia is the lack of warehousing. You have to put the cargo and it also has implications. We actually don't want the cargo to be warehoused and shot off on the railroad or truck line somewhere else. You look for more value-added manufacturing. So we're very bullish on logistics, and we're very bullish on the port and its implications. It's also the hub for the offshore wind, we have to -- what should be the largest wind energy field going on in federal waters certainly off the East Coast, and that's a big project underway. So these are -- this bodes well for the greater Hampton Roads in Virginia. David Bishop -- Seaport Global -- Analyst Great. Appreciate the color. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thanks, David. Chris, we're ready for our next caller, please. Operator Yes, sir. And next we have Brody Preston of Stephens Inc. Your line is open. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Hi Brody. Good morning. Brody Preston -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. I just wanted to circle back on the financial targets. And John, I know it's going to be a lot of -- a lot of different things that maybe get you there. But just, when I kind of look at this quarter, you're out like a 1.28% kind of ex-PPP PPNR ROA and '18 and '19 you all provisioned 12 bps on average assets. So when I kind of like put all that together, I get to like an ending tax effected kind of ROA in the 1% range. And so, it seems like getting to the 1.1% to 1.2% because I know you're kind of skewed more toward the lower end without much help from rates is going to be reliant on growth. And so, I guess just when you look at the forward projections, do you think 7% ex-PPP loan growth is enough to get you to that 1.10% to 1.20% ROA, or is there going to be other things that need to happen in between to get you there? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Yeah. I think the upper single digits will allow us to get there in that -- in that range from a loan growth perspective. Real drivers of that are really keeping expense growth down, while improving in the revenue stream ex-PPP. One of the things as I mentioned was, we are looking for about 8% to 10% growth in non-interest income, which will be helpful toward those targets as well as the 5% to 6% ex-PPP growth in what I'll call core net interest income. So if you take those factors altogether, it should be seen again ex-PPP, it should be seen about it, call it 8% to 10% growth in our pre-cash, pre-provision numbers which should get us as I mentioned to those lower end of the ranges on return on tangible common equity and ROA. Also, as I mentioned, it won't get us to that 53% or less, efficiency ratio, but that's where we're going to have to rely on some margin expansion due to the increased rates going forward, plus continued growth in the loan book. Brody Preston -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst Understood, understood. And then, I think John had mentioned Rob in his prepared remarks that there were some one-time cost this quarter, do you happen to have what those were? Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So if you look at a couple of things probably [Phonetic] in the $800,000 range or so, we had some severance costs which we wouldn't expect to be continued. We had some sign-on bonuses although we expect that we'll incur some of those this quarter as well. So my estimate is about $800,000 in that -- in that 95-plus [Phonetic]. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Yeah, there wouldn't be normal run rate items. Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Right. The real issue is, we are -- we have increased the run rate due to these salary adjustments that were made in the quarter. [Speech Overlap]. Yeah. Brody Preston -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst On the CRE payoffs, I just wanted to ask, is it -- is it customer refis, or are customers selling their properties, and then, are there any specific geographies within the footprint where the payoffs are more concentrated than others? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank It's pretty broad-based. The larger books of business are going to be in places like here and the Greater Richmond area and larger traditional markets like Fredericksburg would be an example. And it's really across the key markets. Brody, a couple of things are going on here. More than half of it is going to be sale of property. Now this is not that uncommon. So if you're a developer, you construct it, we finance your construction, the property goes out of construction, and to -- we would categorize it as non-owner occupied, and then, it stabilizes. It leases up, it gets a track record that if it's a merchant developer, meaning their principal intention is to build, which creates value and sell, that's been going on a very accelerated pace. There are several reasons for that. You look at the low cap rates, there's a good argument that commercial real estate values could be as good as it gets in the short term. There is some anecdotal evidence that there is a foot race going on trying to get ahead of the potential rise in capital gains tax, the potential elimination of 1031 exchanges now. But based on what we heard the President say, recently, maybe people should be a little less concerned about that, I don't know. But we are clearly seeing these properties sold. Then, if you intend to hold them and some do, if you're going to hold it for the long-term, what you should do is you should go to an institutional, non-recourse, fixed rate term lender like an insurance company, multifamily is kind of ground zero for this. You can see it based on the drop in multifamily balances, because there's so many places you can go to get non-recourse fixed rate term, financing 20-year amortization more. And that -- and term, and that's not something we do. We do see banks out in the market competing with institutional lenders booking very long-term fixed-rate loans we generally are not going to do that, Dave Ring, do you want to comment on what you're seeing? David V. Ring -- Executive Vice President & Wholesale Banking Group Executive Yeah. We just have set up a business where we can act as intermediary for those permanent [Phonetic] placement outside to the investor communities. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank So part of our capital markets effort is, we can actually place fixed rate, non-recourse term debt institutional lenders and capture some of the value chain, if you will or we can for example do a construction loan and have our own takeout in place. So we may as well take advantage of that, because that's the normal course. So Brody, that's what we see going on. It's at a record level. It's been elevated for a while. And I guess on a positive note, it's demonstrating that we're financing high quality projects with high values, and there's a lot of demand for them. But the good news is that the construction pipeline and the commercial real estate pipeline looks terrific. We did have a record quarter of new bookings, and I can't emphasize enough the comment I made about what I call it the missing vintages at new construction loans, that they were suppressed in Q1 and Q2, and so we don't have them kind of refilling. Think of it as that [Phonetic] was draining out of the commercial real estate bathtub faster than we were refilling it, and so now the faucet is on, and it has been for a while, so that actually will create a tailwind and hopefully help mitigate this. Hope that... [Technical Issues]. Brody Preston -- Stephens Inc. -- Analyst [Technical Issues] questions everyone, I appreciate it. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thanks Brody. And Chris, we're ready for our next caller, please. Operator Thank you. [Technical Issues] Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Your line is open. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Hi Laurie, good morning. Laurie H. Hunsicker -- Compass Pt Rch & Trading LLC -- Analyst Hey thanks, good morning. Rob, I'm hoping you can help us think about core margin a little bit here. You know, PPP fees, obviously 21 basis points accretion, 9 basis points and for your release going to potentially 3 basis points next quarter. If you can just remind us what is on the amortized fees remaining in PPP. And then just kind of netting that, you're getting to a 2.80% [Phonetic] number, how we should be thinking about that, and how you're thinking about that, I guess with respect to your targets? Any help you could give there would be great, thanks. Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Laurie, in terms of what's remaining from a PPP deferred fee level, it's about $15 million, and we do expect that a material amount should come in this quarter as we have about $450 million or so outstanding loans that could be in the process of being forgiven over the next two quarters, is what we estimate. Probably the bulk of that hopefully will be in this quarter and some will bleed into the first quarter. So, in terms of the core margin, as you probably calculated, this quarter if you take out PPP, and you actually take out accretion, we were about 2.89% [Phonetic], which was down about 11 basis points from the prior quarter, again a lot of that being driven by the lower yields that we're seeing on the loan side due to lower interest rate environment and pay downs of what we'd consider higher yielding loans out of the portfolio, and securities yields coming down a bit due to considerable reinvestment at the low market rates that we're seeing. It is kind of two-fold. One is we're pricing about $40 million to $50 million in mortgage-backed cash flows coming through that we're reinvesting, and then we've also added to the securities portfolio due to the excess liquidity and increased that $200 million or $300 million in the quarter. I expect that, that will kind of stay in that relative position. We're about 19% of total assets now, and we could get up closer to 20% before it's all said and done. We do have $600 million of excess liquidity that we want to put to work, both in the loan book and then probably some of that going into the investment securities book. So, all that said is, we're expecting the core margin kind of to bottom out around this level and start to see some, hopefully, increasing throughout next year, although not a lot until we start to see some of the interest rate movements as the Fed starts to move late next year and into the next year, '23. But we're kind of in this up a couple, 2 basis points to 5 basis points as we go into next year, is the way we're thinking about it, primarily because we're reinvesting that excess liquidity into higher yielding assets. I hope that helps. Laurie H. Hunsicker -- Compass Pt Rch & Trading LLC -- Analyst Very, very helpful, yes, thanks. And then just a follow-up question on credit, so I guess both for you and maybe Dave. Just looking, your overall reserves to loans, 77 basis points, if you exclude PPP, 80 basis points, how do you think about holding that line? How do you think about where the right level in terms of reserves to loans should be? Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, you kind of broke up there. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank How do you think about the appropriate reserve under CECL today? How low is it going to go? Robert M. Gorman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, you're right. Laurie, you know, of course we've been releasing reserves really since the end of last year and each quarter this year. The way we're looking at that is CECL, day one CECL is about 75 basis points, and if you look at just the allowance for loan losses, it was about 71 basis points. Included in that, our working assumption is that we think we'll be kind of stabilizing in that area. However, it could actually go a little bit lower, but it all depends on continued economic forecasts looking good, and the credit metrics continuing to be good. But there is a case to be made that it could go lower than that, because if you look at our day one CECL allowance, that included almost $300 million of third-party consumer loans that are in runoff mode. Those are down to about $87 million as we look at the end of this quarter, and $24 million of our original CECL allowance reserve was related to that portfolio -- it was pretty heavily reserved for. And if you look at it from the commercial and the other categories of loans, we were more in the 60 basis point range, blended to about 75, but it was about 60 if you take out PPP or third-party consumer. That's come down nicely, that will continue to come down. So there's a possibility we could drop a little bit below that day one CECL, although we're not calling for that at this point. Laurie H. Hunsicker -- Compass Pt Rch & Trading LLC -- Analyst Okay, great. And then, just really quickly, do you have an update on deferrals? I know they were somewhat de minimis, but do you have a dollar number there? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank It's de minimis. Deferrals are just not a factor at this point. Laurie H. Hunsicker -- Compass Pt Rch & Trading LLC -- Analyst Okay. And then John, last question. Can you help us think how you're approaching M&A? Are you still actively looking, have things changed from last quarter? Just any thoughts, your currency is strong, how you're thinking about that? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Sure, thanks Laurie. Not a lot new to add here. I always preface any comment with the same statement, so I'll do it again for the record. You know, this is -- we view ourselves principally as an organic strategy that can be supplemented or complemented by M&A. We are interested. We do think it could be helpful. The goal here, which we try hard to achieve, you want to actually [Technical Issues] and that puts you in a good position. So sure, we'd be interested. Nothing has changed there. Anything that we would consider would have to make strategic and financial sense or we wouldn't consider it. We think about the continuum from larger to smaller, and we're sort of -- we have this running debate in the Company about how small is too small, how large is too large. But we feel like it's all about optionality, Laurie. And, from our standpoint, I don't like the term opportunistic, I wince whenever I hear the term opportunistic M&A, because that sounds like something just came along or somebody did a process or an auction, and that's not our style. So we need to make sure that there's good strategic alignment, good cultural fit, and I would just reiterate, as we've said before, if and when we did something, I don't think we would surprise anyone in terms of why we did what we did, because it would have to check all of those boxes. So [Technical Issues] point, we're disciplined. I see this as a 2022 opportunity perhaps, and I've been here five years now and there are conversations I've been engaged in for five years in some cases. So there's always some degree of conversation going on out there. So that's really the best answer I can give you. But I can assure you anything we do would make financial and strategic sense, and it would be something where we had supreme confidence in our ability to execute it well or we simply wouldn't do it, because it does too much damage otherwise. Laurie H. Hunsicker -- Compass Pt Rch & Trading LLC -- Analyst Great, thank you. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thanks Laurie, and Chris, we're ready for our last caller, please. Operator Yes sir. And lastly, we have William Wallace of Raymond James. Your line is open. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Hi Wally. William J. Wallace -- Raymond James Financial Inc. -- Analyst Hey John, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple. But on the expense side, you highlighted some -- I think you classified it as market adjustment at the branch level due to wage inflation pressures. And I'm just curious, were you losing people, were you worried about losing people, struggling to recruit? Just kind of -- you know, some indication of why now rather during the normal COLA time. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Yeah, all of the above. This issue was especially pronounced in terms of wage inflation at the entry level roles and sort of the lower tiers of the pay scale, and so we were having challenges. And remember we're talking, you know, there's still a pandemic out there, and we're talking about frontline, client-facing roles, and that added to the challenge. But the reality is that wages have gone up, period, for these types of roles. We were having some challenges in terms of attrition, nothing crazy, but it was definitely higher than we wanted to see. We were having challenges filling open jobs. And, you can see headcount went up and some of that was simply the fact that as we made this change, we began to be able to more successfully recruit, we've seen attrition go down. There's another -- I think this is one of the better things that we've done in the sense that it wasn't simply let's raise wages and the branch. This was really a strategy, and I compliment Shawn O'Brien, Head of Consumer Banking with the fundamental strategy, which is, let's change these roles around. So instead of having traditional tellers, we now have universal bankers. These are higher value-added roles, they're trained when the branch is not busy, they're able to come off the teller line and assist customers with advisory services, sales activity, etc., and they can go back to the teller line when we need help there. It's just a higher value-added role. There's nothing new about the universal banker model, but it was a change for us, so we had to bite the bullet, we did the right thing. And I think that positions us more competitively. Shawn, do you have anything you want to add to that in terms of what we did and why? Shawn E. O'Brien -- Executive Vice President and Consumer and Business Banking Group Executive Yeah. I think that was a good summary, John. The only thing I'd add is obviously the universal banker role allows us to run these branches with less staff. So that is helpful as, post-COVID, we are running with smaller staff. It has helped us with attrition. As you mentioned, we've seen that drop considerably. We are able to start bringing talent in again. We were struggling with that early in the year. And then last, we are seeing a significant increase in sales, as you've talked about. We are seeing significant growth in customers, we are seeing our highest months ever as far as checking sales. And we're even seeing a return to consumer lending growth, which is the first time in a long while. So very positive trajectory for us in the branch network. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Good timing too, because some of you recognize Project Sundown, which is our focused effort on the Truist merger, and then I guess we should also throw in that other big competitor that's experiencing challenges. We are seeing outperformance as branch closures are happening now. Maria, do you want to comment on--? Maria P. Tedesco -- President of Atlantic Union Bank Sure. I'm glad you mentioned Project Sundown, because it really wasn't -- it started out as sort of the Truist target, but we widened it because there's several opportunities in our market where there's consolidation happening with other banks and mergers. The program really is designed to acquire consumer and business market share from these competitors, given the disruption that we've seen in the market. So we've had several programs that are targeted specifically when there's branch closings or lots of disruption that we're hearing on the ground. So we have targeted these programs. And in last March, we knew there was specifically like 33 branch closings in our market. That campaign that included media, digital advertising, feet on the street, really guerrilla warfare kind of marketing, we saw about a 28% increase in new checking accounts in that month, and then again this fall we've seen the same thing happening. So we go in and out of the market depending on what's happening at that time. Next year, we do have some new market intelligence that there's about 40 Truist branches, which is the largest branch closing. So we are going to expect to institute the exact same program at that time, and we expect very strong results as well. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank So you can see why we took the bull by the horns in terms of the consumer bank. We're getting good results from that team, which we appreciate. William J. Wallace -- Raymond James Financial Inc. -- Analyst Okay, appreciate all that color. One last question. On the C&I line utilization, you said, I believe, 25%, and you hope you've troughed. I wonder if you've gone back in time and just kind of looked at how utilization rates have rebounded in times when they've troughed? And maybe based on historical data, how quick could rates -- could utilization rebound, and to what magnitude? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Well, those are all great questions. Dave, I'm going to ask you to chime in here in a minute since we are getting a little longer in the tooth in our careers. The first thing that comes to my mind is what we saw in the financial crisis in the Great Recession, when we saw our utilization plunge as companies began to hoard cash and sales dropped off, etc. Wally, the complexion of our organization has changed as we've grown, added new capabilities. So it's kind of hard to say -- if you ask me, what would you expect normal utilization to look like at Atlantic Union Bank, a couple of years ago, I would have said 42%, low-40s is about what we would expect. It's hard to know what's normal from here, but I can tell you it's not 25%. I have never seen anything that low. David Ring, do you have any perspective on what to think? David V. Ring -- Executive Vice President & Wholesale Banking Group Executive Just to add on to what you said. If it just goes up 10 percentage points to 35% [Phonetic], we'd add another close to $250 million of outstandings, and so any sort of investment in the businesses will really help us. The other thing is, companies are also not investing in owner-occupied properties, they're just doing maintenance of what they have. So we normally see a lot of owner-occupied property financing, and we're actually seeing a decrease in that here. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank And that's just normal amortization, mostly. Those are term loans that pay back every month, and to your point, we've seen a reduction in that. David V. Ring -- Executive Vice President & Wholesale Banking Group Executive Right. So those operating companies borrowing on lines or real estate just getting back to some level of normal will help us in getting that. John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank Now, here's where supply chain disruption comes in, in my opinion, which is talk to any business client, and we talk to a lot, they're going to tell you they're having trouble meeting their orders, that they could sell more stuff if they had more inventory, more equipment, more people. And so this is my point I made in my opening comments, this is a supply problem. And I think it's going to be with us for a while, but I think it's going to be on an improving trend. So what does that mean for us? What it means is, it means increasing line utilization as they begin to build working capital and we finance classic timing differences and that sort of thing. So I think that there's reason -- there's good reason to be hopeful that we'll see some improvement in line utilization, we think. We'll continue to fight excess liquidity. But businesses seem pretty confident, and we keep adding new clients as well, which is good. And then another point, I hate to keep coming back to construction lending, but it's such an important part of the headwind that we faced. What was construction loans outstanding a year ago? $1.2 billion, which is pretty normal for us. And what is it right now? $877 million. So there's another delta. Because of the ramp that's going on in that construction loan pipe, we should have the ability to drive that up. To Dave's point, it won't take too much increase in utilization to pick up. So these are things that give us some reason for optimism. But we don't want to be overly optimistic, because there's going to be a lot of liquidity sloshing around for a while. But you know, these businesses are actually doing pretty well. William J. Wallace -- Raymond James Financial Inc. -- Analyst So to put words in your mouth, is it fair to say that you would classify your 7%-ish type loan growth target as conservative? John C. Asbury -- President and Chief Executive Officer; Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Union Bank I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say -- at this point, there's such -- it's so difficult to forecast anything, Wally. I would just say realistic. How's that? We think we have a reasonable line of sight to making that happen. Anything could happen. Could it be better? It's possible. We'll continue to update you quarter by quarter. William J. Wallace -- Raymond James Financial Inc. -- Analyst Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much for the time. Take care. Bill Cimino -- Investor Relations Thanks Wally, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your time. We ran a little bit over, but the webcast will be available on our website at investors.atlanticunionbank.com. Have a good day, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Goodbye.

Now, if you've been watching the SPAC space for any length of time, you know that the filing of an S-1 statement is usually the cue for a stock sell-off . The announcement of a flood of shares coming on the market, potentially depressing the prices of shares already trading, often spooks investors . For some reason, though, that's not happening with BlackSky today. Image source: Getty Images. So what Why isn't it happening? At first glance, it doesn't seem to make much sense. After all, in today's filing, BlackSky registered a total of 106.4 million shares of common stock that could potentially begin floating in the future, plus a further 8.3 million warrants for the purchase of shares (which are included in the 106.4 million). That's a lot of shares, and a lot of reason for existing shareholders to be nervous. Now what On the plus side, though, as the S-1 filing makes clear, about 24.1 million of these shares will only be issued and become publicly traded upon the exercise of warrants, and those warrants will only become profitable to exercise once the share price of BlackSky stock exceeds $11.50, or even, in the case of some warrants, $20 a share. With BlackSky stock currently trading below $11, however, it's unlikely these warrants will in fact be exercised, and if that's the case, as much as 16% of the shares just registered will actually never be issued -- and will never dilute shareholders. Unlikely as it may seem, there's always the possibility that shareholders could get so excited over today's news that they end up bidding the stock up past the exercise price!",

So what Highlighting bullishness in the overall market on Monday, the S&P 500 was up about 0.5% as of this writing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite , however, was up more than 1%. Finally, many growth tech stocks were up several percentage points or more. The three stocks have been beat up this year, along with a lot of the other growth stocks that performed exceptionally well in 2020. Even including their gains today, Fastly, Teladoc, and Lemonade are all still down 43%, 29%, and 47% year to date, respectively. Perhaps some investors think the three stocks are oversold. Now what Earnings season continues to unfold, with many tech stocks reporting earnings this week. Teladoc is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results after market close on Wednesday. And Fastly's earnings report is scheduled for the following Wednesday, Nov. 3. Lemonade hasn't scheduled its third-quarter earnings date yet. But if last year's earnings release date is any indication, investors should look for a potential earnings report from the fast-growing insurance company sometime during the second week of November. All three companies are expected to report rapid growth in their top lines for Q3. The highest expectations out of these three (in terms of revenue growth rates) are for Lemonande. On average, analysts project the company will report third-quarter revenue of $33.4 million, up more than 87% year over year from $17.8 million. Expectations are high for Teladoc, too, though the company's October 2020 acquisition of Livongo Health is contributing substantially to the quarter's growth rate. On average, analysts expect Teladoc to report revenue of $516 million -- up from $289 million in the year-ago period. Finally, the consensus analyst forecast calls for Fastly to report third-quarter revenue of $84 million. This is up 18% from the third quarter of 2020. Fastly has been working through a challenge of facing a significant platform outage in Q2 . The global outage for the edge computing platform led some customers to reduce their spending -- a trend the company forecast would have a negative impact in Q3 as well -- and Fastly management has been working hard to win those customers' full confidence back and see them increase their usage of the platform to their previous levels.",

    "full_description": "The Trade Desk ( NASDAQ:TTD ) specializes in digital advertising. Its demand-side platform helps ad buyers create data-driven campaigns across devices like desktop, mobile, and connected TV. And despite the dominance of rivals like Alphabet 's Google and Facebook , The Trade Desk still benefits from a big market opportunity and a strong competitive position. In this Backstage Pass video, which was recorded on Oct. 13 , Motley Fool contributor Trevor Jennewine shares his thoughts on why The Trade Desk is still a smart long-term investment. Trevor Jennewine: I've read a lot of articles around the internet talking about how a lot of advertising is already digital -- I mentioned earlier that about 61% of ad spend would be on digital ads this year. But just 21% is going toward programmatic advertising. There's still a huge runway for growth in this industry, and that is where things are headed. That quote I showed earlier, management believes that all media will be transacted by machines in the future. It will all be transacted programmatically. I think that there is a lot of growth in this industry, and I think that should be a \"high tide raises all ships\" type situation. This is good for The Trade Desk, but it's good for a lot of other players in the industry as well. Later on in the presentation, we'll hit some of the things that differentiate The Trade Desk from its rivals. This slide just summarizes what The Trade Desk does. Its platform is self-service, so ad agencies. It gives ad agencies to access to a wide variety of ad inventory. Like I mentioned, that's across mobile devices, desktops, connected TV, social platform, search engines -- pretty much the whole internet. The Trade Desk is a gateway to purchasing digital ad space. I believe this 500 billion figure is actually higher now. I think The Trade Desk platform sees something like 600 billion ad impressions a day. The company is giving its clients access to a lot of inventory, and it's collecting a lot of data in the process, which just feeds back into its predictive models to make targeting more efficient. Nicholas Rossolillo: That's a crazy number isn't. I think Magnite has a similar figure in their presentation about the trillions of ad requests and impressions. But that get made across the world on the internet every day. We're talking huge numbers, massive amounts of data, huge audiences as well. This is a huge market. Jennewine: The Trade Desk is the leading independent demand-side platform, which just means that it's achieved a greater scale than all of its other independent rivals. We'll cover what that means, but essentially independent just refers to the fact that The Trade Desk doesn't own any content. That separates it from a company like Google or Facebook, both of which own web content. That scale, it benefits its clients because they're able to choose from a huge array of digital ad space; and it benefits The Trade Desk, because they're able to capture that data. That enables them to correlate things like viewer demographics with clicks and conversions, so that over time, they're able to let their clients know: \"Hey, this ad impression is particularly valuable. There's a very high chance of conversion here. Or forget about this one; this isn't worth anything to you. There's not a very good chance that this user is going to take the desired action.\" This slide right here, it focuses on the fact that The Trade Desk is an enabler, not a disruptor in the industry; and that has helped it gain traction with a lot of ad agencies. The company had about 875 customers as of the end of 2020. Then, this slide hits on one of the differentiating factors for the business. That is that The Trade Desk focuses exclusively on the buy side. I mentioned that it doesn't own any content. Let me explain why that matters. Google and Facebook: Google owns Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, several other web properties. And then Facebook has its social network, and Instagram. Both of those companies, they absolutely dominate the digital ad industry right now. They have over 50% market share collectively. Their business model obviously works. But there's a conflict of interest there. They have these walled gardens and they're selling their own ad inventory. They're not necessarily incentivized to help an ad buyer find the best inventory. They are incentivized to sell them the best inventory that they have to offer within their walled ecosystem. Then, to make things more complicated, both Google and Facebook actually work with third-party publishers, and that just means suppliers of ad space. So, if you have a website or a mobile app, you can make ad inventory [available] through Google's or Facebook's buy-side tools. Now these companies are selling their own ad-inventory alongside third-party ad inventory. Again, that just creates a conflict of interest. They're obviously incentivized to sell their own ad inventory. The Trade Desk sidesteps that whole situation. The company does not own any content. It does not own any ad space. It doesn't buy up ad space and resell it at a higher price. It doesn't work on the sell-side of the equation. It's exclusively focused on the buy side. If you're looking to buy digital ad space, those are the types of clients that would make use of The Trade Desk's platform.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Davante Adams of the Green Bay Packers was placed on the COVID-19 list. Getty Images The Green Bay Packers placed wide receiver Davante Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list Monday. Being placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list is for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been in close contact with an infected person or persons. Adams ranks second in the NFL with 52 catches and is third in yards (744). Green Bay (6-1) travels to Arizona (7-0) Thursday for an NFC showdown, and playing without Adams would be an enormous blow to the Packers. Green Bay learned earlier on Monday that defensive coordinator Joe Barry had also tested positive for COVID-19 and will likely miss Thursday’s game in Arizona. “You have to take it in stride and just approach it with positive mind and a positive attitude and just make the best of whatever situation you encounter,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. After a rocky start to his career, Adams — a second round draft pick in 2014 — has developed into one of the top receivers in football. Adams was named to the Pro Bowl each season from 2017-20 and he was named first-team All-Pro in 2020. Adams was the NFL’s No. 1 rated wide receiver by Pro Football Focus last season. Adams set a franchise record with 115 receptions and posted 1,374 receiving yards (11.9 avg.) a year ago despite missing two games. He also matched Sterling Sharpe’s single-season team record for receiving touchdowns (18) set in 1994.

He led the NFL in receiving TDs, receiving yards per game (98.1) and receptions per game (8.2), becoming the first NFL player to lead the league in all three categories since Sharpe did so in 1992. Adams earned first-team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press, the first Packers wide receiver to receive first-team recognition since Antonio Freeman in 1998. He also earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers Association. “There’s a reason he’s got that ‘99’ rating in Madden,” LaFleur said recently. “He is a baller. I don’t think there’s anybody better than him. We’re fortunate to have him.” For the time being, though, Green Bay doesn’t. And that will make the Packers’ trip to Arizona on Thursday even more daunting.",

With the MLB ALCS ending in six games, and no Game 7 on Fox, the network opted to air a replay of WWE Friday Night SmackDown to go head-to-head with AEW Saturday Night Dynamite. Per fast national data —as I first reported—the SmackDown replay garnered a higher total viewership than Dynamite’s first-run show on TNT, with SmackDown drawing 578,000 overnight viewers while Dynamite drew a total overnight viewership of 515,000. The demo numbers are not yet available. Dynamite, which aired on Saturday last week, was down 21% from last week’s overnight number of 649,000. It’ll be interesting to see how SmackDown’s latest counter-programming effort directly impacted Dynamite’s viewership when the quarter-hour breakdowns are released. Per Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter , last week’s head-to-head war did not have any significant impact in terms of one show taking a sizable audience away from the other. MORE FROM FORBES AEW Dynamite Results: Winners, News And Notes On October 23, 2021 By Alfred Konuwa “Smackdown likely cost Rampage 31,000 viewers over the half hour and 25,000 in 18-49, or 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent in 18-49,” said Meltzer. “AEW cost WWE no total viewers but did cost them 3.5 percent in the key demo. So the crossover between the two shows wasn’t large.” MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers In the final ratings numbers from Friday, AEW Rampage drew 533,000 viewers while SmackDown’s first-run broadcast garnered 2,249,000 total viewers in its return to Fox per Brandon Thurston of Wrestlenomics . Rampage was down 8% from last week, while SmackDown saw an increase of 160% after being preempted to FS1 last week. Compared to SmackDown’s last Fox broadcast on October 8, the show was up 5% from 2.147 million. WWE SmackDown vs. AEW Rampage | October 22, 2021 Friday Night SmackDown Total Viewership—2,249,000 Friday Night SmackDown Viewership in 18-49 Demo—759,000 (.58 rating) AEW Rampage Total Viewership—533,000 AEW Rampage Viewership in 18-49 Demo—288,000 (.22 rating) WWE SmackDown Replay vs. AEW Dynamite (Overnight Data) | October 23, 2021 WWE SmackDown Total Viewership (Replay)—578,000 AEW Dynamite Total Viewership—515,000 SmackDown’s Crown Jewel fallout featured a very controversial main event as Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch’s title exchange ceremony went awry. After both appeared to go off script, Becky Lynch and Charlotte reportedly got into a heated exchange backstage , which resulted in Charlotte being escorted from the building by WWE officials. SmackDown also advertised an appearance by Brock Lesnar, who was featured in a big angle opposite Roman Reigns. After running roughshod on the WWE roster and officials, Lesnar was (kayfabe) suspended indefinitely by Adam Pearce. For Pearce’s troubles, Lesnar delivered multiple F5’s to the WWE official in what was an angle similar to his storyline suspension the night after WrestleMania 31. Coincidentally enough, that 2015 angle aired the night after Lesnar’s first match against Roman Reigns. AEW Rampage kicked off its world title eliminator tournament as Orange Cassidy defeated Will Hobbs. With AEW executives suddenly having to address its glaring diversity issues , showcasing an all-white tournament field after just one match won’t be a great look for AEW’s optics . Thankfully, AEW’s TBS Championship tournament offers a far more eclectic field with rising star Jade Cargill as one of its favorites. Dynamite also featured an instantly classic main event between PAC and Andrade El Idolo. Dynamite, meanwhile, featured a third showdown between Cody Rhodes and Malakai Black as Rhodes finally exorcized his demons with a polarizing win over Black.",

The partnership with Uber Freight is a new market opportunity for Marqeta in transportation, where Uber has already emerged as one of the leading digital freight brokers globally outside of China. Image source: Getty Images. So what Marqeta, which completed its initial public offering in June, has already benefited from enormous momentum lately. It handles payment processing for Square , Affirm Holdings , and other digital commerce companies. In the second quarter, Marqeta reported a 76% year-over-year increase in total payment volume, reaching $26.5 billion for the quarter. The Uber deal follows previous partnerships announced earlier this year with Alphabet 's Google Pay, London-based credit card provider Tymit, and Goldman Sachs ' Marcus digital banking service. Now what Several fintech companies , from the leaders like PayPal Holdings and Square to small payment processors like Marqeta and DLocal Limited are experiencing robust growth. Marqeta is facing a very long runway of growth ahead, as there was $6.7 trillion in transaction volume conducted through U.S. issuers in 2020. Its recent growth and future opportunity might justify the stock's high price-to-sales ratio of 35 at the current quote. Marqeta's impressive client list proves it has the technology, speed, and reliability that companies value. Every deal it signs only increases the likelihood that Marqeta can continue to capture a growing share of a massive addressable market opportunity .",

    "full_description": "What happened Shares of crypto mining stocks went on a strong run to start the week as cryptocurrencies themselves bounced higher on Monday. At 3 p.m. EDT Bitcoin ( CRYPTO:BTC ) was up 4.9% in the last 24 hours while Ethereum ( CRYPTO:ETH ) was up 5.3%. Most major cryptocurrencies are moving higher for the day. Mining stocks are up big across the board but leading the way are Hut 8 Mining ( NASDAQ:HUT ) rising 17.1%, CleanSpark ( NASDAQ:CLSK ) jumping 13.1%, and Canaan ( NASDAQ:CAN ) moving as much as 14.1% higher. The three stocks are currently trading 16.9%, 13.1%, and 13.1% higher, respectively, as I'm writing. Image source: Getty Images. So what Rising cryptocurrencies will help drive revenue and earnings for mining companies long-term, so that's definitely the biggest speculative factor driving these stocks today. The current run higher for cryptocurrencies shows no sign of stopping today, although momentum could turn at a moment's notice. The biggest news of the day from these companies was Hut 8 Mining announcing a 35 megawatt mining facility in North Bay, Ontario, that will be online by the end of the year. This is the company's third facility will use a blend of byproduct steam, hydrogen, and natural gas to power the facility. This facility schedule was pushed forward after delays at the company's planned Alberta, Canada, facility. CleanSpark added another 2,250 mining units to its plans last week, bringing its total miners being added in the next year to 26,830. Higher cryptocurrency prices along with more mining units should lead to better financial results for these companies and at the end of the day that's what's going to drive the stocks higher . Now what Volatility has worked in the favor of Bitcoin miners recently and today is a great example of that. But investors should keep in mind that momentum can change directions and head lower as well. What I'll be watching over the next few weeks is what earnings and guidance looks like for crypto miners. The industry has been riding a wave of momentum for months and that should lead to strong financial results. And with profits pouring from the industry we should see mining expansion and even some share buybacks from these companies. I wouldn't read too much into the crypto mining move today because it was simply following the price appreciation for large cryptocurrencies. But the long-term trend does seem to be for higher crypto prices, which is good for miners, and when we get earnings reports we will see just how strong this price move has been for their operations.",

The deal would have valued the popular social media platform at roughly $45 billion. PayPal put a halt to rumors that it was seeking to acquire Pinterest. Image source: Getty Images. However, those talks apparently proved fruitless. In a statement posted to its investor relations website, PayPal said \"it is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest at this time.\" Now what PayPal was believed to be pursuing Pinterest to accelerate its plan to build a \"Super App\" that would provide a wide array of financial and e-commerce services to its users. But investors questioned the benefits of purchasing a social media platform that has seen its user growth slow in recent quarters. Moreover, Pinterest's monthly active users declined by 5%, to 91 million, in its key U.S. market in the second quarter, as people emerged from pandemic-related lockdowns and spent more time offline. The decline stoked concerns among investors that Pinterest's most profitable market might already be saturated. Together, these fears helped to push down PayPal's share price by more than 10% as the rumors of a potential deal intensified. The market's poor reaction may have caused PayPal's management to reconsider its plans. News that the deal is now off drove Pinterest's shares lower on Monday. PayPal's stock price, meanwhile, rallied as much as 6.3%.",

    "content": "JioPhone Next 4G smartphone by Diwali JioPhone Next 4G smartphone by Diwali New Delhi: JioPhone Next 4G smartphone will enable vernacular speakers to connect with people speaking different regional languages, mainly to target around 30 crore 2G users in the country. The made in India smartphone is likely to be launched before Diwali. JioPhone Next will have the first operating system -- Pragati OS -- jointly developed by Jio and Google, customised for Indian users, the telco said in a video released on Monday. Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani at the group's 44th annual general meeting had asserted that an ultra-affordable 4G smartphone is essential to make India '2G-mukt' (free of 2G). He had said India still has nearly 30 crore mobile users who are unable to escape from inefficient and exorbitant 2G services since most basic 4G smartphones remain unaffordable. Jio was the first company that launched 4G mobile phones in India free for consumers, where they were required to pay a refundable deposit of Rs 1,500 for a JioPhone, built like an advanced feature phone. JioPhone Next will come with a touch screen, and the device is built on Qualcomm chipsets. The smartphones that use Qualcomm chipsets are priced on the higher side compared to those using competing chipsets with a similar level of computing power but Ambani had promised that \"JioPhone Next will be by far the most affordable smartphone not just in India but globally\".The phone will use a language-translation tool as a special feature to enable communication between vernacular speakers in India. \"Jio's vision for India resonates with that of Google. Pragati OS - Pragati stands for progress - is powered by Android, as a result of this passionate effort bringing together best minds at Jio and Google,\" Android general manager and India engineering lead Ram Papatla said in the video. JioPhone Next will have a translation feature working in 10 Indian languages. \"I am so proud of this new OS. All of us are. It has some of the coolest new features specially translated now. I can speak in one language, and the phone will translate that into another language,\" JioPhone Next product management BinishParangodath said. The phone will also come with a read-aloud function, which will read out content from any app open on the screen, Jio official Ashok Agarwal said. JioPhone Next will have a Qualcomm processor and manufactured at RIL group's Neolync unit in Tirupati and Sriperumbudur.  ",

    "content": "Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersDelay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersIndia's plan to privatize Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has run into rough weather with bidders struggling to find partners and spread their financial risks, according to people familiar with the matter.The three suitors - the Vedanta group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital - are talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven't been able to finalize partners, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Some bidders are finding it difficult to invest due to sustainability rules that make it tougher for them to buy a stake in an oil refiner, some of the people said. The fresh hurdle to sell the government's entire stake could temper some of the euphoria generated by the recent sale of Air India Ltd to the Tata Group and slow down the nation's biggest privatization drive. The sale of the state-run refiner-cum-fuel retailer would have fetched about $13 billion for the exchequer and other shareholders. BPCL shares fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 431.7 at the close in Mumbai, the most in more than a month, following the Bloomberg News report. The massive price tag means bidders as well as the Indian government want a consortium with stronger technical and financial muscle for the transaction, the people said. Spokesmen at the finance ministry and BPCL weren't immediately available for a comment, while Apollo Global declined to comment. Representatives at Vedanta and I Squared didn't reply to emails seeking comment. India Still Hopes Oil Majors Will Join Race for Biggest Sale.A global push toward green energy and pressure from investors to slash emissions is holding back companies from making large investments in fossil fuels. The pandemic and its fallout has also delayed the process and discouraged global firms from committing big investments in traditional fuels. For BPCL, the bidders have been slow in conducting due diligence as they wait for new partners to join, the people said. That will likely upend the federal government's aim to complete selling its entire 53 per cent holding in BPCL by the end of this financial year in March, for which it had planned to seek financial bids next month. BPCL allowed bidders virtual access to its financial data early April, but it hasn't progressed beyond exchange of a few queries and some initial discussions with the state-run company's management in the past six months. \"Bidders are conducting due diligence, but uncertainty over the bidder consortium and process complexity, including valuation, may lead to potential delays,\" Fitch Ratings Ltd. said in a commentary last month. \"We believe the risks of further Covid-19 waves and global oil and gas companies' increased focus on energy transition lead to additional uncertainty over the timing and valuation of potentially large acquisitions in the sector.\" BPCL has three refineries that can process about 700,000 barrels of oil daily, a marketing network of almost 19,000 fuel stations and close to 6,200 liquefied petroleum gas distributors.

Now what The deal Bloom Energy announced with SK ecoplant doesn't directly impact Plug Power. But it could help benefit the company in several ways. Plug Power's own deal with SK Group resulted in the formation of a joint venture \"designed to accelerate the use of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in Asian markets.\" Today, Bloom and SK said they plan to set up hydrogen innovation centers, including one in South Korea. That coincides with Plug Power's goal to \"establish a gigafactory in Korea by 2023 to produce fuel cells and electrolyzers, and later provide them in broader Asian markets with a substantial cost reduction.\" At the same time, Plug Power has been working to build green hydrogen facilities in several locations throughout the U.S. Anything that helps promote the use of hydrogen fuel in the U.S. -- or in Asia, as today's announcement does -- should be a positive for all companies in the sector. Plug Power investors recognized that today, and boosted the stock as a result.",

A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on Oct. 19, 2021. Emily Flippen: Welcome to Industry Focus. Today is Tuesday, October 19th, and I'm your Consumer Goods host Emily Flippen. Today, I am joined by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Asit Sharma. We're going to be talking about another business that's headed to public markets. Yes, we've been doing a lot of S-1 shows. But this company is really interesting and I think a lot of consumers may have heard about it before. It's NerdWallet. Asit Sharma: Yeah. Emily, I'm so excited to be nerding out with you today for a few minutes on this one. Emily Flippen: Yeah. I was really excited when I saw that this company filed to go public because I'm familiar with it. As a consumer myself, I will imagine that a lot of our listeners, if you engage with Motley Fool's content like listening to our podcast, subscribing to our services, I'm willing to take a bet that you've probably also engaged a little bit with NerdWallet. They are in the personal finance space, their website really aimed at providing financial education. But really, on all actually, trying to get you sound FERC credit card, maybe takeout alone if you need it. But they are really about empowering consumers. I was excited to see this business go public. But as we were preparing our notes for today's show, I noticed that we got different reads, I think, from this business. That's great because we don't often disagree, Asit. Asit Sharma: It's a wonderful, Emily, to able to think, \"I disagree with Emily on this one.\" [laughs] If you are too sympatico, it leads to not optimal investment results. I think this is positive and actually, I like this business. I mean, circling around to the business as a whole. Just a short cut where I'm going to land by the end of this half-hour, yeah, think it's investable. But there are few things did turn me off. Let's start with the things that you like. I think where we interpreted a bit differently around that the introduction of this company to the public markets. Yeah, I too have popped on their site a few times in the past few years. Haven't signed up for a product through NerdWallet, but it's certainly in searching for other things happened upon it and senior content. It's great story, well organized, etc. But tell us about the founding of the company and what you like when you were first going through that prospectus. [laughs] Emily Flippen: I actually liked the CEO/founder. His name is Tim Chen. He founded the company back in 2009. Really, to start as a spreadsheet. I think he was working for his sister who is interested in getting a credit card, but was really confused about all the different options out there. He set up the spreadsheet essentially to kind of track and understand the benefits of different cards to help them power her to make the decision that was best for her finances. I enjoyed not only that back story, but actually reading through the shareholder letter. There's a big letter at the beginning of the prospectus written by Chen. The focus is really on providing, I won't say investors, I guess, consumers with simplicity and clarity. My personal Motley value here at the Fool is transparency. I think that so much of the financial services industry is committed to just convincing the average person that stuff is too hard or too complicated to do themselves. When reality, people should feel empowered to be able to make those choices. A little bit of an education goes along way. I felt some of those tones coming out in the shareholder letter, which maybe kind of happy to read through it. I think Chen probably agrees with that same level of mentality. Asit Sharma: Yeah, I think you're right, Emily. Overall, this is a site that's doing a lot of good out in the world because there is so much to look at. You don't know who has just extremely vested interest in what they're selling you. I can totally see that, but I don't know about this. His letter really rub me the wrong way. I got Steve Ells vibes reading through it. [laughs] For those of you who don't know who's Steve Ells, he's the founder of Chipotle . Of course, he is no longer running the company, but he had a theme he would return to so much during the earlier years of Chipotle. Which is our focus on sustainability, doing good in the world makes us the good guys. These other guys, like McDonald's and quick-service operators, they're the bad guys. They are not trying to be sustainable. They are bad for the environment. He had just a derogatory attitude toward those. Now, Chen doesn't come across this way. Let me get that clear. But he did say something that rankled me in that same letter. He says, sales commissions effect trustworthiness and complexity makes it time-consuming for anyone to become knowledgeable across all areas of personal finance. Especially with the explosion of choice we are witnessing in financial services. As you point out, Emily, he encompasses this statements on either side with stories about his family and friends and how he constantly helped everyone cut through the weeds of personal finance and options and helped steer them away from vested interest in the investment world. But the company generates referral fees from the manner in which it reduces complexity. I'm going to read to you from the top of their homepage. \"Many or all of the products featured here are from our partners who compensate us. This may influence which products we write about and where and how the product appears on the page. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own.\" I totally don't have an issue with the way the company makes money. We've got a similar business here at The Motley Fool called The Ascent. But at the end of the day, let's not pretend that the advice is totally disinterested. If one of umpteen credit card providers you've ranked objectively pays you for prime space on your review page, that can affect that users decisions. Ultimately, to me, it's only slightly removed from a sales commission. The recommender has a financial incentive to push one product more pointedly than another. Anybody the advertising business has been around can tell you how important product placement is; placement on a webpage. If Chen hadn't tried to stake out this whole year since how ground versus commission products? I would have answered your problem with the statements. It affected my ability to trust management because it came across disingenuous to me. Emily Flippen: I get that. There is a little bit of a holier than thou attitude by essentially coming in saying, we're not commission-based when the service is somewhat commission-based. You can think about it that way. To your point, advertisers pay to be on their platform and while they don't edit or adjust the review. Someone thinks of product is poor, but it's paid to be at the top. I mean, opinion expressed will be poor. But it does impact what US consumer sees. I will say it's an interesting business model. They are paid though, as a portion of this clicks that go through that ultimately generate revenue for that advertiser. If it's a credit card, it's getting someone to apply for that credit card. If it's a loan, it's getting someone to apply for that loan. Same thing's true for, say, insurance products. I think the one thing I will add is that there is some value and actually presenting useful information to the purse than he was reading the site. Because they need them to go through and actually make that application, make that loan application if that comes to push, and that's how they get paid. They want to present the best products in front of people there, which is out of maybe slightly better than our peer commission-based structure. Asit Sharma: I will agree with that. I mean, simply presenting a consumer with options as a way of educating a consumer on what he or she can ultimately run with. I do think, overall, the business model, as I said, that's good in the world. But I got just a different vibe. [laughs] But let's move on, shall we? Emily, Chen is only 39 years old, he's been leading the company since she was 27. I mean, that's so impressive. He retains voting control, but he doesn't own any common shares or won't after the IPO. You know a founder who is still very vested and has control over decision-making, but might not have that financial stake in the ground. Let's talk about the mission. You and I both like this so we started to agree very quickly after a rare disagreement. We both like this mission. What is the mission here? Emily Flippen: Their mission is to provide clarity for all of life's financial decisions. I like that because I think it's specific enough to what the business does, you get a good idea about what the future holds for them, while it's still broad enough to apply to a lot of different opportunities. It's not to best match consumers with their best credit card, that's a very limiting mission statement. But it's also not to make the world better, because that's really challenging, it apply it to anything. So very clear, provide clarity for financial positions. I like that A to B, I feel like it's sums up the business well. Asit Sharma: I think financial life decisions or life's financial decisions are something that brings up emotion and uncertainty for so many of us when you're thinking about big picture decisions. Even getting a new credit card for many of us. You're getting your credit card with a certain limit, you're going to use it for x, but that's going to impact your personal finance on into mortgages and bigger decisions, products tied to that. I like the sense of relief that where a friend pointing in the right direction. I thought it was very strong. This business, we already mentioned that they're basically a financial services publication. They make money by charging advertising referral fees. Users like their sites, because as you wrote in our note, Emily, they can access unbiased, simple, and trusted information on finance questions like, which credit card should I get? Can you tell us about the partners on their site, how they benefit from the way this funnel is structured? Emily Flippen: Yes, so NerdWallet, as many investors who are familiar with the business may already be aware, have a really strong top of funnel approach. They had in the most recent six months, over 21 unique users access their content every month. Lots of people coming in at the top of funnel, and even though only a handful or a select number this people will ultimately end up making a purchasing decisions based off their site, the people that are coming to NerdWallet are ready to make those decisions. You don't go to NerdWallet, you just casually read through what loans are available to you unless you were actively looking for a loan. The type of people coming through this really wide top funnel are ready to start making these purchases which means that it's a really valuable real estate for their advertisers or their partners to get out in front of those consumers' faces. Because it has such a strong brand reputation, they have really a lot of unpaid search where 70 percent of their traffic comes from unpaid organic searches. People say making a Google search and then clicking on NerdWallet article. Some really impressive SEO here that really makes it valuable to partners. I'd argue also consumers although the unbiased nature of it is obviously up for debate. [laughs] Asit Sharma: So that's great organic search traffic, over 70 percent, 21 million unique users, but they also have an option to sign up and register with the site, and that helps them actually get a better beat on you. You're a more, I think, driven potential customer and you'll have a higher lifetime value. They say that those who register with the site they're more easily monetized because they are more engaged and the lifetime value of these registered users is five times greater than non-registered users. They also have more than twice the number of transactions and sessions as well. If you think about those unique users who are not registered versus the ones who are registered, there's a big Delta between the usage when someone goes ahead and submits their information, and I think that's also impressive. Emily Flippen: It was this registered user approach that I thought was interesting about NerdWallet. When I think about the fact that they're reaching for what would be a five billion dollar valuation, we'll talk about their finances, but that's a big company. It's a big mission, bigger than just here are some referral fees and I like the fact that they have this offering for registered users, which provides personal finance, management in a sense. If you're familiar with Intuit 's Mint, similar aspect there. They have credit tracking, net worth tracking, budgeting software. You come in, maybe get pulled in through a free article to NerdWallet. You like what you see, maybe you apply for something like a credit card or a loan, but then you also register for their site, and as part of registering that, you get all these tools to help you better manage your finances. They're not monetizing that. I don't really quite know how they would monetize that, but maybe that's good for at least base levels of engagement, around 43 percent of their total unique users are registered users, so about nine million of the 21 million users. Asit Sharma: In this day and age, coming to market, you almost need to show some statistics that point to future recurring revenue. Something that looks like a software as a service model, even if it's not. So that's important for them. But it also points to how different this is from so many business models that we look at. The revenue from year-to-year is unpredictable. They've recently acquired a company called Fundera, which provide similar offerings. It's like a smaller site, small business loan information is what they specialize in, and they provide that to small and medium sized businesses. But Emily, this is a company that very much ebbs and flows with economic cycles. You had pointed out to me that you see this as similar to or driven by underlying demand in the banking industry. Could you explain to us a little bit of what you saw in reading through this S-1, how that's so similar? Emily Flippen: Yeah, I would say that similar economic events that impact demand for banking are probably likely to impact NerdWallet. If you look over the course of 2020, their credit card revenue actually declined 30 percent because there were lower approval rates due to just general economic uncertainty. Their advertisers were less willing to give people loans because they were uncertain about the economic future. Meanwhile, over the same time period, loan revenue increased 48 percent because interest rates have been so low and there's really high demand for things like home refinancing. When you think about the type of economic structures that will impact the bank, you can think about it impacting NerdWallet. As we thought about risks for this business, I have to say, I had a hard time pulling out just classic red flags here. I think the biggest risk for me is the fact that so much of what they wrote about in their S-1 was aspects that drive their business that are completely out of their control. Virtually, all of the demand for their revenue, they can't do much to stimulate. The best they can do is still be the premium site with a best top of funnel. But when tides move against them, which they will, as the economy ebbs and flows, there's very little they could do to change that reality. Asit Sharma: True. If you are the type of investor who really scrutinizes every quarter and gets emotional over one quarter relative to others this might not be the company for you. I was surprised at how lumpy the business is, but it makes sense if this is the type of company where, let's say you could employ a 10-year holding period, because any economic cycle is going to have one or two big exogenous shocks in a given 10-year time period. We know that. There was a great recession, then we had COVID-19 with increasing frequency. I think also because of climate change, we'll see this. Overall, NerdWallet can prosper, it's just not going to be this linear, smooth path to revenue and stock price appreciation. I think that this is a bet on the focus on consumption in the US economy because the business model is concentrated in the US. I see that growing at a pretty steady clip over the next several years, and there's no reason that they can't continue to grow in this lumpy variable fashion if they don't get disrupted themselves by newer challengers, it's not a high barrier of business. Emily Flippen: That's certainly true. Let's think about their finances here. I mentioned earlier that they're seeking a five billion dollar valuation. They have 2020 revenue of just under $250 million. They're on a run rate right now for 2021 of around 360 million, so we're talking about a forward just price to sales of somewhere around 13-15 times, which is pretty lofty for this business. It becomes even a little bit more lofty when you look at their bottom line. While they were profitable in the past, 2019 and 2020, saw around a 10 percent and a two percent net profit margin, they were actually unprofitable for the first six months of 2021, largely because they've been ramping up their marketing expenses so aggressively. It's something to keep your eye on. I don't know if they're trying to fund growth here, they're reaching out trying get that top line to grow faster. To be honest, I'm not quite sure where they'd spend that money to make that a reality. Asit Sharma: This is a business that needs that marketing as a lever. They had a very interesting turn toward the negative in operating cash flow that turned negative to the tune of 18 million bucks and tied to that, Emily, you pointed out they've got a very substantial receivable backlog. Receivables are up. Part of that is having an effect on the cash flow. They have a 25 percent concentration. Their end-of-period receivables for this S-1 to unnamed customers, and historically, they've been concentrated 20-30 percent among two or three names at each period end. I think what's important here for us to realize, again, for those of us who've been trained on software-as-a-service models, this is not a company that has your or me as the end customer, its customers are its referral partners. What this means is they really step into the world of procurement with these big companies just as a manufacturing company would, which means that you're waiting 60 days to get paid. You're dealing with the partners procurement system and you're going to be financing your business on those receivables. It's not that you're getting paid upfront like in a software-as-a-service model and then that money is in the bank, you just realize the revenue over the next 12 months, it's a slow cash moving model. We noted, looking at this company, that they have an asset baseline. Basically they're using their receivables as a working capital loan lending base. Just to keep in mind again, we talk about variability. It's not just in the sales, it's also in their ability to use cash flow. It makes even funding self-growth a bit harder. The way they compensate from that is what you mentioned, they turn up that marketing leverage that in any given period, there's going to be a huge expense in the income statement. Emily Flippen: The good news there is that because their gross margins have been so impressive and steady at around 92 percent over the past few years, that if and when stuff shifts, whether it be a macro sense, whether it'd be just less sticky with their advertisers, they can scale back that marketing spend and pretty easily return to some level of profitability. Even considering those receivables, even considering the huge marketing spend that they've built up during 2021, if they see opportunity, they want to pull those people in, and when opportunities ceases to exit, they can probably cut that spend. The one thing I was really missing here and I didn't see it, it's possible that I missed it, although I did do my best to read through as much of this as possible, I didn't see any breakdown for things like lifetime value or acquisition costs for the actual people visiting their site. I had very little visibility into what the actual economics for their core customers were. I was hoping to get that, even if it was just for, say, registered users. I was really hoping to try to get some insight into the value of that customer they're bringing in because it does help classify that marketing expense. You can see it more clearly in your head. Asit Sharma: True, and I have a guess that customers come to the site, they go away. If we were to look at the classic concept like churn, we'd see a lot of churn there. As we've been talking about it, as the economy starts to surge and people have more to spend, that's when they tend to make those life decision. It's cyclical business in some ways. But when the going is good, it's good. Just the last thing on the financials, Emily, that you liked, I like this very much. They've got a very nice topline in terms of the breakdown of revenue. It's evenly split between three big buckets. Could you walk us through those? Emily Flippen: Yes. I like this too, pretty well diversified. The first big bucket is credit cards. It makes up around 30 percent of their revenue. That's a slow, steady grower for them, up 10 percent this year, thanks to the pandemic recovery largely. Then you have loans, around 36 percent of revenue as we mentioned earlier, and then what they call others, that's the remaining 35 percent of revenue and that includes things like their insurance business, but also that small to medium business revenue from Fundera, as well as things like investing or banking. Asit Sharma: We've got just a few minutes left. Let's move on to risks. You've mentioned one already, Emily, tell me another big-picture risks and I'll throw in one as well. Emily Flippen: We mentioned this earlier, but virtually all of their revenue comes from the US. They made one acquisition in the UK, currently, what they called NerdWallet UK, but it doesn't contribute materially to their earnings. But the biggest risk, as I mentioned earlier, I really do think is just how, I guess, out-of-control they feel about their financial performance, even looking at their credit card, the loans in the other segments, when management called out the performance of those year-over-year, it was all outside factors. Credit cards did better because of the pandemic recovery. There is a huge increase in mortgage loans up 94 percent, again, because of low interest rates. There's a decrease in investing revenue because lower consumer demand, lower excitement in 2021 for investing. It was all just like, well, you're telling me stuff that has happened to you that results in financial performance, but what are you doing to make financial performance a reality? I guess the business felt more reactive than proactive to me. That just stands out to me as probably the biggest risk. Asit Sharma: To me, I think that there's a long-term risk in how its financial partners will be studying the return on their investment. I mentioned this actually a few weeks ago in terms of another industry, which was the travel industry. In that Marriott, huge hotel hospitality name gradually started marketing to its customers itself. It acquired the Starwood group with that end in mind because the Starwood group had such an amazing loyalty program. They turned that program into the Marriott Bonvoy program to bypass their partners, which were these online travel agencies which take a commission. They're slowly shifting more business to a direct model. I'm wondering if in the future and over time, big financial partners might become more savvy with the types of digital content marketing that sites like NerdWallet and our own, The Ascent are so good at and decide, look, it's a lot of investment upfront, we have to invest in new people and systems. But that lifetime value is worth it to us to have our customer come directly to us and stay with us because once we've got them, we can market directly to them. I see that as a secondary risk. But overall, I did like the brand power that NerdWallet has. I think it can at least alleviate most of the risks we've talked about today by capitalizing on that and then I wonder if geographic expansion at some point wouldn't be in the offing for this company. I didn't see a lot of discussion on that in the S-1. Emily Flippen: I'd be really interested in particular to see what type of valuation this company goes public at. Like we mentioned a couple of times before, they're looking for five billion dollars. As much as I want to say I think that's ridiculous, especially because the market ties have turned a little bit over the past few months; maybe a little bit less forgiving to unprofitable growth companies that are depending on things like advertising revenue. However, I will say it's not unheard of, I don't think it's a completely ridiculous evaluation in comparison to some of the numbers that we've seen. So I'm just so interested to see how the market reacts to this. Personally, I am sitting on the sidelines for this business for at least a very long time into the future. I will probably continue to use their products as a consumer among a host of others, but do I have interest in investing? Probably not. Asit Sharma: Yeah, same here. I'm going to make a prediction. I think on predictions, one out of 10 this year, I'm so bad at predicting the future, but I'm going to say, look 3-4 billion. The reason is we've seen so many companies get what they wanted from the markets. This is a company that doesn't have some strong annualized recurring revenue to point to, so investors can say, \"I don't care, pay another few percentage points of multiple,\" because look at this locked in business, it's so great. We've seen that time and time again. This is a bit different. This model is different and investors should be a little more wary and not confuse it. It looks like a SaaS model, but it really isn't. It's got a few customers that it works with and neither sides knows exactly how many ultimate consumers will come into the funnel in any given quarter. For that reason, I'm interested as a long, long term hold, a 10-year hold, a 15-year hold. But I'm not jumping to buy shares just yet. Emily Flippen: Asit, thank you so much as always for joining and talking about NerdWallet here. It's fun nerding out. Asit Sharma: That was fun nerding out with you as well, Emily.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Secondhand shopping comes to the airport at Montréal-Trudeau in Canada. ARI/LXR Aer Rianta International has opened the first high-end vintage fashion store anywhere in the travel retailer’s global airport estate—with trading now into its first month. Classic brands for sale include Chanel CCO , Dior, Ferragamo, Gucci, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Prada, though other less well known labels are also present including Celine, Fendi and Loewe. In a tie-up with LXR , a Canadian start-up in the vintage luxury space, the ‘pre-loved’ boutique has landed in the Loop Duty Free shopping area at Canada’s Montréal-Trudeau International Airport. It is the first luxury vintage concept to launch in an airport in North America. Richard Maynes, ARI’s global head of fashion and accessories, and a former buyer at the well-established but ultimately ill-fated Debenhams department store group, told Forbes.com : “The pandemic has led to a greater focus on sustainability. There is a growing desire from customers to make more conscious consumption decisions and reduce their impact on the planet.” He added that creating a pre-loved fashion offer at the airport supports this behavior trend while also reducing waste, and giving travelers a more accessible route to top-end brands. “Pre-loved demonstrates the strength of luxury to retain value and remain desirable. The key to making this project work was finding the right partner, which we believe we have done with LXR,” Maynes added. Will passengers go for it? Vintage luxury is a test concept for Ireland-based ARI—which has direct or indirect travel retail interests in 14 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. The 1,150 square foot store in Montréal-Trudeau Airport will be analysed carefully to assess its potential elsewhere.

ARI/LXR ARI North America general manager and director Jackie McDonagh said in a statement: “Circular fashion has become important. This is a progressive step for our sustainable mission of driving socially ethical and environmentally responsible operations across all aspects of our business.” ARI is in something of a transitional phase. After its international business became loss-making to the tune of €66.5 million in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic (from a profit of €13 million in 2019) the company, led by CEO Ray Hernan, has restructured, resulting in the departure of approximately 1,000 employees, to ensure ARI’s long-term viability. The company is now laser-focused on ensuring that its retail offer is aligned with consumer expectations in the post-pandemic era—for example conscious consumption—and a lot more agile to endure continued uncertainty in the travel retail channel. So far, the travel retailer says it is “pleased” with the initial launch of LXR and the response it has had from customers. Maynes added: “We anticipate Louis Vuitton and Gucci will be very popular with the mix of passengers and customers we have.” Passengers can order online up to three months prior to travel and arrange pick-up within the store in the departure lounge for collection before their flight leaves. Demand at highest price points According to the website, the two current bestsellers from the LXR selection of handbags, wallets and scarves are a beige YSL compact leather zip wallet said to be priced locally at $815.00 but selling for $495.00 in-store, and a black lambskin Chanel tote slashed from $5,500 to $2,995 (all prices in Canadian dollars) . The latter is the most expensive product available in the store. Interest in used luxury pieces with accessible price points has become big business. According to the Ellen McArthur Foundation—which campaigns for circular economy approaches to business—by 2029 clothing resale is expected to be bigger than fast fashion within the textiles and apparel industry. In ThreadUp’s 2021 Resale Report the secondhand market for apparel is projected to double in the next five years to reach $77 billion, growing 11 times faster than the broader retail clothing sector (based on figures from GlobalData). Online luxury fashion retailer Farfetch says that on average one pre-owned purchase saves 1kg of waste, more than 3,000 liters of water, and 22kg of CO2. Thrift also became a pandemic habit that is expected to stick. If that remains true over the longer term, then more consumers will look to buy pre-used—and guilt-free—luxury lines when they want to glam up to go out.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin While you’ll never hear it from NPR or the rest of the monoculture media, “ rule of flaw ” by federal agency bureaucracy can impede economic efficiency and undermine health, safety and environmental progress. It does this with top-down programs that propagate in sometimes costly ways throughout the economy and society. US President Joe Biden speaks about the bipartisan infrastructure bill and his Build Back Better ... [+] agenda at the International Union of Operating Engineers Training Facility in Howell, Michigan, on October 5, 2021. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images The sole check for a federal government that regulates heavily on top of spending $6 trillion a year is a small office of regulatory affairs that resides at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). But rather than serving as a blockade, even this body is headed by an acting administrator sympathetic to \"promulgating new regulations to advance a progressive agenda .\" That’s not the same as scrutinizing regulations that can impede growth and jobs. One of the Biden administration’s very first actions was uprooting the Trump-era regulatory liberalization agenda and replacing it with a “Modernizing Regulatory Review ” directive to agencies (to dispel any confusion, to “modernize” means to expand government). The new approach eases the exercise of unilateral regulatory power, in ways parallel to how — when asked about Biden’s priorities on climate — administration spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declared that “[W]e don’t need Congress. We can do it without Congress .\" Much as the public is similarly told that cost of Biden’s “Build Back Better” program consisting of “physical infrastructure and human infrastructure” is “ zero ,” regulatory modernization has done away with already largely nonexistent cost-benefit analysis by elevating unquantifiable and nebulous regulatory aims as benefits . In keeping, Biden’s memorandum to agencies declared: “Our Nation today faces serious challenges, including a massive global pandemic; a major economic downturn; systemic racial inequality; and the undeniable reality and accelerating threat of climate change.” While climate change may be “undeniable,” regulatory costs more broadly are routinely “denied,” with the last strands of green-eyeshade oversight at OMB replaced with a presidential solicitation of \"concrete suggestions on how the regulatory review process can promote public health and safety, economic growth, social welfare, racial justice, environmental stewardship, human dignity, equity, and the interests of future generations.” Lest there be any doubt about this new role for the one-time traffic-cop OMB, Biden specified that “The recommendations should also include proposals that would ensure that regulatory review serves as a tool to affirmatively promote regulations that advance these values.” MORE FOR YOU Biden’s Proposed IRS Bank Account Snooping Authority Runs Into State Resistance 2021 Diversity Green Card Lottery Winners To Be Shut Out Because Of Visa Deadline The Swamp Grew – Even Under President Donald Trump The memo further asks that the new architects “consider ways that OIRA [the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs] can play a more proactive role in partnering with agencies to explore, promote, and undertake regulatory initiatives that are likely to yield significant benefits.” As for OMB’s long-standing “Circular A-4” guidance on regulatory oversight, which already omits many categories of costs and was never a powerful regulatory impediment, Biden wants it modified to “ensure that the review process … fully accounts for regulatory benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify, and does not have harmful anti-regulatory or deregulatory effects.” Deregulation—the very word—is thereby officially set aside. The progressive policies increasingly enabled in the administrative state framework replace market operation and civil society with government in the coercive pursuit of a range of non-quantifiable goals, even without legislation from Congress. Recalling anew the “pen and phone” of the Obama era, agencies have been unleashed by the even more radical (and underestimated) Biden to issue guidance, memoranda, notices, circulars, bulletins, letters, interpretations and other incarnations of regulatory dark matter . Even the simple Trump-era online portals to help the public more easily locate guidance documents have been eliminated, with some agencies using verbatim, boilerplate rationalizations for the move. The 20 senators who wrote to Biden twice earlier this year expressing concerns over the loss of the portals were met with silence. The upshot of all the foregoing is that, rather than act as a watchdog (albeit never that aggressive), the OMB is now to join the thousands of regulators to not only help write and lobby for new regulations, but to even come up with new regulatory proposals, unceasingly, in whatever realm the left fancies that somebody’s benefits exceed somebody else’s costs. OMB’s ostensible cost-benefit balancing stance has shifted to one of seeming one-way regulatory expansion, with emphasis on new and social-engineering benefits such as those of “human infrastructure.” It is by now obviously alien to this so-called “progressive” mindset, but there is an alternative view that, while the government does have a certain limited role to play in our lives, governments are the impediments to rather than facilitators of most social and economic values we strive to attain. In response to Biden and the progressives, the more market-oriented members of Congress, while stuck in the progressive ditch so to speak, should prepare ahead of time a regulatory reform agenda for the 118 th Congress that will be seated just over a year from now, under the not-unreasonable assumption that the next Congress will be less “progressive” than the 117 th . For example, administrative state reforms like better disclosure and accountability have been covered by policy advocates in detail, and proposed by the legislators themselves . These all matter a great deal. Biden would of course never sign them, but regulatory liberalization needs to be a prominent part of the coming decade’s policy conversation. However, something stronger is needed alongside them, a marker rejecting the Biden pro-regulatory agenda more forcefully even than Biden rejected the Trump liberalization agenda with his series of revocations of Trump actions. What might that option be? A proposal for an “Office of No.” Healthy government requires recognizing downsides to coercive interventions like Biden’s sweeping agenda. But even more, it also requires vigilant legislative and executive institutions and mindsets that both seek reasons not to add yet another rule or decree to the existing inventory of hundreds of thousands. And those institutions should incessantly purge rules — and agencies, too. Therefore, to supplement or replace OMB’s now-discarded review function, an Office of No should be specifically chartered to formally articulate and place in a growing public record the case against every regulatory measure that the rest of the unelected bureaucracy , consultant class, and media stand in uniform, unwavering support of, and present alternatives. Keep the office at OMB if you like, but that’s not necessarily important. A congressional committee could be devoted to its oversight and to the regulatory reform theme as such. Unlike the reflexive stance of Washington, most matters are not public policy questions. While “market failure” is said to justify regulation, more common are political failure and the failure to have markets. While, again, full realization would need to await a Biden successor, the body of evidence can eventually be used as inputs into other long-standing proposals such as a Regulatory Reduction Commission to reduce the contours of Washington. All regulatory enabling statutes, and subsequent proposed rules and final rules, contain ambiguities that could have been resolved differently; they also sport unintended consequences perhaps not apparent at the outset. Yet, once rules and the agencies administering them are in place, they become part of the breathed air, costs of entrenchment forevermore ignored. Then their scope expands; resolutions of even newfangled policy issues get constrained by the self-interested blinders of the central-bureaucracy perch itself. We get trends toward greater centralization and away from free enterprise and the dispersed expertise necessary for genuine governance, entrenching agencies whose time has perhaps come and gone, if it ever actually came at all. The Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rule has been a come-and-go example for over a decade that typifies the administrative state’s pretense at expertise , that comes at the expense of not just sound resolution of the specific dispute at hand, but of the economy as a whole. Congress, in bipartisan fashion, often compounds these errors with highly regulatory legislation like the infrastructure bill and this past summer’s so-called Endless Frontier Act that also disregarded property rights and elevated central government management in economic affairs that should be left free. While such errors, again, are bipartisan, an Office of No could change the atmospherics by, for example, helping ensure that new economic sectors are not born captive to Washington regulators who inappropriately assume authority over them and often govern by guidance document besides. As for the past two hundred years of intervention, the Office of No will have its hands full revisiting everything from central banking and leaving cryptocurrency alone , to antitrust regulation, to fidget spinners . Most regulations are not yet written, and probably ought not be: If drones are a problem in cities, leave them alone in the country where new airspace property rights can be developed and lessons brought to bear in congested areas; ease NASA out of space flight; let smart cities emerge organically, not governed by so-called public private partnerships; make sure that “ helicopter government ” does not use new technologies and biometrics to regulate us remotely. The list goes on. A formal body could highlight the superiority of market-oriented or liberalization alternatives over command options for each regulatory initiative and intervention, continually questioning framings such as “public goods,” and steadily presenting the case for eliminating existing rules (note that the alternative to the administrative state model is not “no regulation”). In addition to challenging the case for intervention in statutory interpretations and in rules, the Office of No should compile visions and plans for elimination of regulatory agencies themselves that become part of administrative and congressional record and eventual reform legislation. For example, there can be “species adoption” alternatives to the Endangered Species policies that alienate and enrage landowners; there can be school choice rather than federal reforms; and so on. The overriding problem today is the newly radical nature of the post-crisis “reset” and Build Back Better mindsets that recklessly foster dependency among able-bodied adults . This exploitation of economic and societal shock by politicians needs to be addressed forcefully in an Abuse-of-Crisis Prevention Act . But that greater need can certainly be supplemented by the presence or construction of an Office of No. While 2021 is likely to deliver to Biden and Democrats a “human infrastructure” package smaller than they intended, they still will have succeeded in the escalation of social regulation as something “ordinary.” Agencies will in turn be issuing rules based upon 2020 and 2021’s legislative interventions for many years to come. The problem isn't just the debate now happening over whether the Internal Revenue Service should snoop on $600 transactions or $10,000 ones; the real mess is that this extra scrutiny is going to be happening expressly in service of these newfangled federal impositions, leaving the targeted public little recourse to voice opposition. Note that the moderate liberals are not trying to stop what the radical ones are doing. Unfortunately, Republicans don’t stop them either . That’s both a legitimate critique of the Office of No approach and a case for it. A Washington bureaucracy characterized by today’s escalating pursuit of power over ordinary human affairs will never choose to regulate less and advance markets, voluntarism and ordered liberty instead of bureaucracy. An Office of No would be one lonesome offset in a realm wherein agencies’ calculation of net benefits is a philosophical impossibility because the very existence of the agency is itself a net cost. It can no longer suffice to talk of cutting federal spending and balancing the budget, especially in an era of the open and self-conscious leveraging of crisis to expand regulation and feed bureaucracy. Some official platform explicitly chartered with “Do Not Regulate” mission can help protect human affairs from state encroachment as well as clarify and effectuate alternatives to, and explicit exits from, command and control rules. It will take a lot to counter government funded academics, government funded agencies, and government funded programs with what, alas, will merely be another governmental body. Here’s hoping it can attract fans outside the beltway that do much of the work and the off-ramping of new grabs of power before they get traction, and that we grow our way out of the Washington bureaucracy. We should recall here that, as a remedy for conventional concerns such as inadequate cost-benefit analysis, an independent congressional office of regulatory analysis resembling the Congressional Budget Office has been proposed in years past. While this would be far too weak for countering today’s double-barreled progressive legislative/regulatory ambitions, it does go a step beyond the call for more resources for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or for additional agency economists to scrutinize rules. These are worth supporting; however the Office of No must be formally chartered with a pro-market institution, anti-bureaucracy, anti-“regulation” disposition to offset the pro-regulatory bias prevailing in the entire rest of the federal government. The air-quotes are there because, just because an agency calls its activities “regulating” or “protecting the public” doesn’t necessarily make it so. From the perspective of this article, market and competitive disciplines are indispensable to regulation. The federal regulatory enterprise increasingly affects us all, but the changes only go in the direction of more government. The modern statesman’s primary task is to double GDP rather than double spending or regulatory burdens, just as the aim of an AOC Prevention Act is expanding intergenerational wealth rather than intergenerational debt and stopping politicians from exploiting crisis. An Office of No can help to counter an increasingly insatiable and feral federal regulatory state.",

Thousands of Yazidis trapped in the Sinjar mountains as they tried to escape from Daesh in August ... [+] 2014. (Photo credit: Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) 2014 Anadolu Agency The world should not forget the atrocities perpetrated by Daesh fighters against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and in the years that followed. Those atrocities include murder, enslavement, deportation and forcible transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, abduction of women and children, exploitation, abuse, rape, sexual violence, sexual slavery and much more. The atrocities committed by Daesh are now recognized as crimes against humanity, war crimes and even genocide, the crime of crimes. The world cannot forget the particular wickedness of the atrocities. Video footage of beheadings, of kidnapped victims thrown from high buildings or burnt alive. These graphic images will be difficult to forget. Until this day, some 2,763 Yazidi women and children are still missing, whether in unknown location or dead. The UN has been warning about the ongoing threat posed by Daesh and its attempts to grow in power yet again, including by abusing the instability brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the fact that Iraq declared victory over Daesh back in 2017, Daesh fighters have been present in the region in the years since. They continue to emerge periodically. Because of that, for example, in August 2021, Iraq launched a security operation to hunt down Daesh militants north of the capital Baghdad. Reportedly , Daesh militants “have an active presence in Tarmiyah district, 50 kilometers north of Baghdad, from where they launch attacks inside the Iraqi capital.” In early 2021, Alliance defense ministers have agreed to significantly raise the number of troops for the NATO Mission in Iraq, reportedly, from 500 to 4,000 . However, this is still far from the assessed number of Daesh fighters and their capability to recruit new members, as we have seen in 2013 and 2014. If the withdrawal from Iraq happens at the end of 2021, States must have a comprehensive action plan to prevent the disaster that we have witnessed in Afghanistan (mindful of the differences between the states but mindful of the risks involved). States must be ready to act to prevent the atrocities against religious minorities in Iraq, minorities which were subjected to genocidal atrocities only a few years ago. This is the time that States must act on the promise of Never Again and prevent avoidable atrocities against religious minorities.

The S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) rose 24 points to 4,569, also on pace for a record close, and the Nasdaq Composite ( NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC ) picked up 136 points to 15,226. Behind the market's performance have been extraordinary performances from some high-profile stocks. On Monday, shares of Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) and Cloudflare ( NYSE:NET ) reached levels they've never seen before, and many investors believe that there could be even further gains from the two innovative companies in the months to come. Below, we'll take a closer look at what's driving these two stocks higher on Monday. Image source: Tesla. Tesla looks to $1 trillion Shares of Tesla were up more than 9% Monday afternoon . That brought the stock price to just shy of $1,000 per share, and it sent the electric vehicle pioneer's market capitalization close to the $1 trillion mark. Several factors helped to send Tesla's stock higher. Wall Street analysts have been increasingly optimistic about Tesla's prospects, and analysts at Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the automaker's stock to $1,200 per share, up by $300 from its previous target. In addition, rental car company Hertz (OTC: HTZZ) made an initial EV order for 100,000 Tesla vehicles, with the expectation of taking delivery by the end of 2022. Tesla's recent earnings report highlighted the huge efforts that the automaker has made to bolster its production capacity. With the company all but certain to reach its 750,000 vehicle-delivery target for 2021, the next step is ensuring that 2022 can take Tesla's deliveries well past the 1 million mark. Tesla stock has been a favorite among individual investors, and the company's fundamental business performance has been impressive as well. Despite constant concerns from some investors about valuation, Tesla's shares have the potential to keep climbing even from current levels. Heading into the cloud Meanwhile, shares of Cloudflare were up more than 5% on Monday afternoon. That left Cloudflare's market capitalization at a much more modest level of $61 billion when compared to Tesla, but the stock has never been higher, and the company has a lot of tailwinds that should support further growth. Edge network services have become increasingly important as more companies rely more heavily on cloud computing and build out their online business presence. Cloudflare has been able to capitalize on this huge demand while avoiding some of the pitfalls that have presented challenges to its peers in the industry. It has attracted some of the biggest companies in the world as clients, and it has been able to retain its customers while encouraging them to increase their spending on cloud-computing services over time. Cloudflare is poised to report earnings in early November, and shareholders are optimistic that the company will be able to sustain its positive momentum. As the global economy recovers, current and potential clients will be in an even better position to scale up their investments in IT development. Expectations are already high for Cloudflare, so earnings results will probably have to be demonstrably superior in order to satisfy investors. When markets hit record highs, there are always strong stocks that are setting the pace. Moves for Tesla and Cloudflare are great examples of exciting investments that are helping to bolster Wall Street as we approach the end of the year.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Amazon is increasingly investing in the multi-trillion dollar market that entails healthcare. This is certainly within the scope of the e-commerce company, given its track-record of bringing new and innovative technologies into existing markets. Most prominent with regards to healthcare is Amazon’s efforts with Amazon Care, the company’s initiative in offering telehealth services. Earlier today, Amazon announced its latest venture : integrating and scaling its famous Alexa systems into senior living communities and large healthcare systems. The goal, as narrated by the leaders behind this initiative, is straightforward: improve people’s quality of lives. Liron Torres, Head of Alexa Smart Properties explains: “We’re excited to extend the experiences customers already love to senior living communities and healthcare systems, and give providers new ways to save time and personalize care for their patients and residents.” SANTA MONICA, CA - SEPTEMBER 6: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos unveils new Kindle reading devices at a press ... [+] conference on September 6, 2012 in Santa Monica, California. Amazon unveiled the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Fire HD in 7 and 8.9-inch sizes. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Getty Images For senior living facilities, the idea is to develop a stronger sense of community and connectedness: the initiative aims to “tailor resident experiences by customizing community information like activity schedules and meal menus. Care team members can communicate more efficiently with residents using Alexa communication features, which enable them to make Announcements, voice and video calls, or send direct audio messages to other Alexa-enabled devices throughout the property.” For hospital systems, efficiency and communication are key factors: “patients can communicate with their care staff, control devices in their room, or stay informed and entertained with news and music, just by asking Alexa. Healthcare providers can communicate with patients quickly and easily with features like calling and Drop In—without the need to enter patient rooms. This enables hospitals to increase productivity, conserve medical supplies and protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, and gowns, and free up staff time to provide more personalized care.” MORE FOR YOU CDC: Salmonella Outbreak Has Left 279 Ill, 26 Hospitalized In 29 States Canadians End Up In ICU After Attending ‘Covid Party’ White House Mandates Pfizer Vaccines for Millions of Citizens ...Before the FDA Clinical or Safety Reviews Have Been Made Public Thus far, many prominent names in the healthcare space are already working to adopt Alexa into their patient care workflows, including Boston Children’s Hospital, Cedars-Sinai, BayCare, and Houston Methodist. But this venture is crucial not only because hospitals are now embracing more digital tools; perhaps more important is that this novel partnership and commitment to digital connectivity indicates a new era and focus to improve quality of life for patients and residents. An extremely well-established principle in clinical medicine is that patient healthcare outcomes and longevity are often linked to far more than purely medical treatment; simply put, patients have better health outcomes when multiple externalities are emphasized, including things such as a comfortable stay, positive support systems, frequent visits from family, and a feeling of community—the idea that a patient has other people that can empathize with and understand their situation. UNSPECIFIED - SEPTEMBER 28: In this screengrab, Vice President, Alexa, Debra Chrapaty introduces ... [+] Alexa Together during Amazon Devices and Services Announcement on September 28, 2021. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images) Getty Images Platforms that can potentially augment some of these externalities—such as Alexa and other digital connectivity tools—can truly reshape the quality of care for a patient. For example, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the most emotionally challenging aspects was that family members could not visit Covid infected patients. While this was intended to mitigate spread of infection, this also meant dire end-of-life situations for many people that were critically ill: they had to spend their last days alone, often only being able to say goodbye to their loved ones over the phone. Though not exactly a replacement for actual human contact, smarter connectivity devices may help slightly alleviate the stresses of this, offering the ability to connect with other residents from the comfort of a patient’s room, giving an opportunity to connect with family at any time, providing the ability to feel included, etc. These are just some of the many intrinsic benefits that may result from initiatives like this. Of course, patient safety, privacy, and security all come into mind, as they should—after all, if remote connectivity devices are going to be available for patients to use 24/7, they also can potentially create room for massive vulnerabilities. With regards to Alexa, the press release indicates: “Alexa Smart Properties senior living and healthcare solutions were designed with privacy in mind. No personal information is shared with Alexa to use the device, and voice recordings are not saved. Every Amazon Echo device offers multiple layers of privacy protection, and residents and patients can disable Alexa’s ability to respond to the wake word at any time by simply pressing the mute button on top of their Echo device. Amazon implements administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for protected health information received as part of HIPAA-eligible skill interactions.” However, as an overall principle, companies that are entering this space must keep the privacy and security issues in mind—purely because of the vulnerable nature of the business. Indeed, perhaps this initiative signals the dawn of a new era of digital connectivity in the healthcare space. Time will tell how companies are able to scale this technology in a safe, secure, and well thought-out manner, and congruently, what kind of value patients will actually derive from this potentially promising venture.",

    "content": "On Sunday, Elon Musk discussed his relationship with the Dogecoin Foundation and he mentioned a few improvements he’d like to see implemented via Dogecoin Core’s codebase. Meanwhile, Github metrics show developers have been working on Dogecoin Core during the last few months and it seems Dogecoin software engineers are prepping the network to address fees, transaction time, and mining. Dogecoin Proponents Including Elon Musk Patiently Wait for a fee Change Fix, Dogecoin Core Repo Has Been Active At the end of June, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk tweeted about the fee change proposal added to the Dogecoin Core Github repository. At the time, Musk said it was “important to support” it. The following week, people noticed that Dogecoin software developers Ross Nicoll and Patrick Lodder were maintaining the project and looking to add Musk’s suggestions. Lodder’s Dogecoin Core fee change proposal explained that the fix would be “gradually deployed to the network over multiple software releases.” Ever since then, there’s been a lot more action happening in the Dogecoin Core Github repo. 1000x.group metrics from the “Number of Developers Working on Specific Crypto Projects” tracker show that between August 2017 to January 2021, Dogecoin network development was a ghost town. In February 2021, 16 software engineers were working on the project, in May there were three developers. 1000x.group statistics show that 12 software developers contributed to Dogecoin Core in August. Last Dogecoin Release ‘Part of a Two-Stage Update to Lower the Fee Recommendation’ Looking at Dogecoin Core’s Github repo indicates that Ross Nicoll and Patrick Lodder are still very active. Lodder dropped the release Dogecoin Core 1.14.4 on August 20, 2021. Lodder’s description of the 1.14.4 software notes that the release prepares the network for a reduction of the recommended fees. The action would reduce the “default fee requirement 1000x for transaction relay and 100x for mining.” “At the same time, it increases freedom for miner, wallet, and node operators to agree on fees regardless of defaults coded into the Dogecoin Core software by solidifying fine-grained controls for operators to deviate from built-in defaults,” the Dogecoin Core 1.14.4 release notes written by Lodder explain. “This realizes the first part of a two-stage update to lower the fee recommendation – a follow-up release will implement the lower fee recommendation, once the network has adapted to the relay defaults introduced with this version of Dogecoin Core.” In the Twitter thread with the Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the individual mentioned “NFT integrations” that looked “promising.” But many others agreed with Musk who was more interested in “lowering fees, decreasing block time & increasing block size.” Dogecoin’s co-creator Billy Markus agreed with Musk as well. “Yeah… IMO dogecoin being fast, scalable, and inexpensive to send around is all it needs to be, it doesn’t need to be yet another blockchain that hosts NFTs or other tokens or whatever,” Markus said. Tesla’s CEO agreed with the Dogecoin co-founder and replied with a 100% emoji. From the looks of it, Dogecoin Core developers are preparing to address Musk’s scaling concerns. The Dogecoin community has supported Musk’s scaling idea for quite some time but almost once a week someone asks: “when will Dogecoin transaction fees drop?” What do you think about Elon Musk’s Dogecoin network scaling concerns and the recent Dogecoin Core development? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.",

Strong demand continued in the third quarter across all our businesses, but global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production and labor availability negatively impacted our financial results; approximately a $75 million impact to revenue and $75 million to operating profit in the quarter. Company revenue was up slightly to a third quarter record of $1.06 billion with the benefit of strong price in the shipment constrained environment. GAAP operating income was down 3%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was relatively flat at $3.41 compared to $3.42 in the prior year quarter. Total segment profit was down 7% and total segment margin was down 120 basis points to 15.5%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was down 4% to $3.40, including approximately $0.55 of negative impact from the global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions. Looking at business segment highlights for the third quarter. Residential revenue was down 2% and segment profit was down 6%. Segment margin was down 90 basis points to 20.3%. Residential revenue from replacement business was down mid-single-digits. Revenue from new construction was up low-double-digits. Lennox Brand revenue was down low-single-digits and revenue from our Allied and our other brands were up low-single-digits. Market demand remains high entering the fourth quarter, and we remained bullish on the residential market as we look ahead to 2022 in the coming years. More people continue to work from home and run our HVAC systems than before the pandemic. With global warming, the hotter weather we are seeing has an exponential impact on reducing the life of cooling systems, and there are more complete HVAC system sales taking place with all R22 refrigerant systems in replacement window. This is driven by the EPA ban on the sale and distribution of equipment using R22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2010 and the ban of the production or import of R22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2020. While R22 refrigerant is still available on the market, it's significantly more expensive than 410A. In many cases, it is cheaper to replace with the new 410A system, which is also more efficient and comes with the new warranty then to repair the old R22 system. For 2005 to 2010, 60% of air conditioners and heat pumps sold were R22. The need to replace these has a meaningful benefit to residential growth. We expect these dynamics to lead the strong residential market conditions for the years ahead. In addition, Lennox and Allied will be running a proven playbook for market share gains. Moving to our Commercial business. Third quarter revenue was up 2%. Commercial profit was down 42%. Segment margin declined 800 basis points to 10.7%. On top of supply chain shortages and bottlenecks disrupting production, our Arkansas factory was hit the hardest by COVID-19 in the quarter and labor availability was a significant issue. At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was down low-single-digits in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up low-single-digits with planned replacement up more than 20% and emergency replacement down more than 30%. New construction revenue was down mid-single digits. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down high-single-digits. National Account equipment revenue was up high-single-digits. The team won two National Account equipment customers in the third quarter to total 11 year-to-date. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was up mid-teens. VRF revenue was up more than 30%. In Refrigeration, for the third quarter, revenue was up 10%. North America revenue was up more than 20%. Europe Refrigeration revenue was relatively flat. And Europe HVAC revenue was down mid-single-digits. Refrigeration segment profit was up 12% as margin expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. Looking ahead for both our Refrigeration and Commercial businesses, demand remained strong. Backlog is up approximately 60% for Refrigeration and 90% for Commercial and order rates continued to be strong. Demand is clearly not an issue, but as we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a material impact to production for supply chain shortages and bottlenecks. We currently expect a similar negative financial impact to our business as we saw in the third quarter, approximately $75 million of revenue and $25 million of operating profit. We continue to see broad inflationary pressures, including for commodities and components, but we have enacted three rounds of price increases this year. The latest one was just on September 1 with a focus on staying ahead of inflation. The company yielded 4% price overall in the third quarter, including 5% in residential. In addition to the carryover benefit next year from our June and September price increases, we're announcing additional price increases heading into 2022. Our Refrigeration business has announced a price increase of 8% in North America effective for December 1. Likewise, our European business has recently announced another round of increases generally from 5% to 10% to drive price in 2022. Our Commercial business has announced a price increase of up to 13% effective January 1. And our Residential business will be announcing another round of price increases in November to be effective heading into 2022. For 2021, we are narrowing our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We are narrowing 2021 guidance for revenue from 12% to 16% to new range of 13% to 15%. Foreign exchange is still expected to be a 1% favorable to revenue. We are narrowing 2021 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $12.10 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.10 to $12.30. Our free cash flow guidance remains $400 million for the year. As the company continues to battle through the disruptions to production from the global supply chain and COVID-19, we are also positioning the company for the future. It's too early to set guidance for 2020, but as we think about next year, we expect strong pricing power to continue. The company yielded 4% in the third quarter, which had just one month of benefit from the third price increase this year. For 2022, we will have carryover price benefit from our June and September 2021 price increase. We have announced additional price increases in our next year. We will have strong price benefit to offset commodity headwind next year. Looking at market drivers and our strong backlog position and order rates, we see Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration up in 2022 as you get more and more of the supply disruptions behind us. We expect to return to strong growth and profitability as we capitalize on market opportunities. Now let me turn it over to Joe. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the third quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $711 million, down 2%. Volume was down 6%, price was up 5% and mix was down 1% with foreign exchange neutral to revenue. Residential segment profit was $144 million, down 6%. Segment margin was 20.3%, down 90 basis points. Residential profit was primarily impacted by lower volume due to global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production, factory inefficiencies, unfavorable mix, higher material, freight, distribution, tariffs and other product costs with partial offsets included favorable price and lower SG&A expenses. Now turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. In the third quarter, Commercial revenue was $212 million, up 2%. Volume was down 6%, price was up 1% and mix was up 6%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $23 million, down 42%. Segment margin was 10.7%, down 800 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume due to global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production, factory inefficiencies, higher material, freight, distribution, tariffs and other product costs with partial offsets included favorable price and mix. In Refrigeration, revenue was $137 million, up 10%. Volume was up 9%, price was up 2% and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $15 million, up 12%. Segment margin was 10.6%, which was up 20 basis points. Global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production constrained revenue and profit growth. Segment profit was negatively impacted by factory inefficiencies and higher material, freight and SG&A costs. Results were positively impacted by higher volume and favorable price. Regarding special items in the quarter, the company had net after-tax benefit of $0.5 million that included a benefit of $2.7 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a net charge of $2.4 million in total for various items excluded from segment profit, including personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a net benefit of $0.2 million for other items. Corporate expense was $16 million in the third quarter, down from $28 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A was $134 million compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 12.7% from 14.4% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, cash from operations was $222 million compared to $440 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $23 million in the third quarter compared to approximately $12 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow was $199 million in the third quarter compared to $428 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid $34 million in dividends and repurchased $200 million of stock in the quarter. Total debt was $1.28 billion at the end of the third quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $44 million at the end of the third quarter. Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review current market assumptions and our guidance points for 2021. For Residential and Commercial Unitary HVAC and Refrigeration markets in North America, for the full year, we continue to expect low-double-digit shipment growth for the industry. For the company, we are now narrowing guidance for 2021 revenue growth from 12% to 16% to a new range of 13% to 15% and we still expect a 1% benefit to revenue from foreign exchange. We are narrowing guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from $11.97 to $12.57 to a new range of $11.97 to $12.17. And we are narrowing 2021 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $12.10 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.10 to $12.30. And as previously mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2021 will have a headwind of 6% from fewer days than the prior year quarter. The first quarter of 2021 had a 6% benefit from more days in the prior year quarter. For 2022, there are no days differences, I'd like just to highlight. Now let me run you through the key points of our guidance assumptions and puts and takes for 2021. First for the items that are changing. We now expect a benefit of $130 million from price for the year, up from prior guidance of $110 million benefit. We continue to -- with continued inflation in components, we are reducing our net savings from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction to neutral, down from prior guidance to be a $5 million benefit. We now expect LIFO accounting adjustments to be approximately $20 million this year, up from a prior guidance of $15 million due to higher material costs from inflationary pressures. About 40% of that was in the third quarter and about 40% is expected in the fourth quarter. Factory productivity is now expected to be a $10 million headwind, down from prior guidance to be a $10 million benefit. Residential mix is swinging from a $10 million headwind -- excuse me, swinging to a $10 million headwind from a $10 million benefit. And corporate expense is now expected to be $95 million, down from prior guidance of $100 million on lower incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A is now expected to be approximately a $40 million headwind, down from prior guidance of $45 million. Within SG&A, we continue to make investments in research and development and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, e-commerce, factory automation and productivity. For headwinds that are unchanged from our prior guidance, commodities are still expected to be a headwind of $80 million and freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind with tariffs still expected to be a $5 million headwind as well. Other guidance items that remain the same. Foreign exchange is still expected to be a $10 million benefit. We still expect a net interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million. The effective tax rate guidance remains approximately 20% on an adjusted basis for the full year. And we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Saltillo, Mexico. This is still on track to be completed by the end of 2021. Pilot runs of the initial products took place in mid-October. We now plan to start initial production before the end of 2021 and ramp up to full production in mid-2022. And we expect nearly a $10 million in annual savings from that third plant. Free cash flow is targeted to be approximately $400 million for the full year. In the third quarter, we repurchased $200 million of stock to complete our target of $600 million for the full year. And then guidance for our weighted average diluted share count for the full year remains between 37 million to 38 million shares. And with that, operator, let's now go to Q&A. Questions and Answers: Operator Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to understand... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Good morning. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst Good morning, Todd, from you, how you're thinking about sort of the pace of the catch-up here from some of these issues, the $0.55 headwind in Q3 similar in Q4. How quickly can Lennox sort of come back from these headwinds when you're thinking about aspects like market share recapture getting those plant inefficiencies down into 2022? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Let me unpack it and sort of swing away at that question, because that's obviously the topic of the day. When we get AHRI data, we look through August here today, we're sort of flat on share. So I think others are having issues too. I know Watsco reported a larger number, but again, their carriers primary are top distributor. If you looked at our 80 -- top 80% dealers and distributors, they're up also. It's a 20% or 30% that we're shutting off that are down so much. So I think share wise, I think we're sort of doing -- our sense is, different people or different OEMs at different times have had their turn in the penalty box. We think we're middle of the pack, maybe even slightly above middle of the pack, but let's see how -- let's see others report and sort of see where they're at. In terms of the timing of getting things behind us, we're making very good progress both on the COVID impact, which I'll talk more about in a second, and about supply chain impact. Things are getting better. Although, financially fourth quarter looks similar to third quarter, that's just the way it works because the costs get hung up on the balance sheet. You don't see it until you sell it. It's sort of the absorption impact and the over time impact and our problems are being seen. And then on the revenue side, it's because we're entering -- we ended the quarter with lower inventory than what we need. But on a production line rates, we're seeing nice improvement. So let me unpack it a little bit. 65%, 70% or so of the issues are driven by supply chain, the balance from COVID. Let me talk about COVID first. We saw unplanned absenteeism in our southern factory, South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi double due to COVID. The good news is that Delta variant has really sort of run its course in our factories, and we're confident, at least as we stand today, that the worst is behind us. On the supply chain side, I mean it's the things we all know. It's integrated circuits, which are in motors, which are in compressors. It's things as mundane as corrugated cardboard and pallets. We've aggressively worked to sort of address that. We're taking inventory in parts and buying a year's worth of inventory in things like integrated circuits to protect ourselves. We're requalifying different parts with suppliers. And we have tiger teams literally in key factories making sure and supplier factories getting what we need. So it's not the best news, obviously, but from a competitive viewpoint, at least data we've seen so far, we don't think we're losing much. We think others are in similar situations, although we have seen all the OEM numbers published. But what we see and share data from AHRI, and we think COVID is behind us to a large degree. And supply chain, while we're still battling it, is better now than it was a month ago and significantly better than two months ago, although we will still see the tail of the financial impact in Q4. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst That's really helpful, Todd. And maybe just one follow-up on residential market demand. You emphasized your bullishness on the market trend there as you look at 2022. The volumes in Lennox Residential I think were down about 6% year-on-year, Joe had said in Q3. Are you sort of thinking that, yes, there's some noise in there from sort of inventory absorption and supply chain. And so that's sort of flat to down slightly, so a good sort of place holder year-on-year for the next couple of quarters. And then as you go through 2022, momentum sort of year-on-year on volumes reaccelerate? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think high level, yes, but let me put it in my own words, which I think will be constructive to your question. If you adjust for the volume miss that we have because of production, our Lennox Residential revenue is up 2%, 3%, 4%. And I think compared against a very tough third quarter comp that we had from last year that people are really intimidated by, including us quite frankly, I think would have been a very nice performance. And then I lay on top of that all the things you've heard me talk about around the units running longer, that R22 systems, 60% from 2005 to 2010 and those system sales kick in and the fact that just continues to be warmer summer. So I still feel, as we've talked about, bullish about the market. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Hey, good morning, everyone. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Jeff. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Hey, Jeff. Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Todd, maybe you can jump into this mix shift. I think you swung at $20 million on the guidance. Is that what people are buying or is that tied to the supply chain and COVID issues? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer It's tied to COVID issues. I mean, we talked about the resi business that new construction was up and replacement was down and there is a couple -- one supply, the other issue is we protected our big builders for obvious reasons. And so that drove it. And then on the supply side is our Mexico facility has -- Saltillo has been the most resilient facility around both COVID and around supply chain for myriad of reasons, and it's a lower mix of product category that comes from there. So we would have been able to have a more rich mix if we were to produce more out of Iowa, not of South Carolina and not of Mississippi. Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. And then just on the -- I mean, it sounds like the COVID dynamic is getting better and who knows what happens with resurgent. But the supply chain dynamic, is your thought that that carries well into '22 or -- I mean, I know you mentioned it getting better, but when do you think you'd get back to normal there? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I'm not sure is the honest answer. I think what I know on a micro level when we look -- when I sit down with the businesses and supply chain reviews is, it's better -- like I said, it's better than a month ago, it's better than two months ago, significantly better than three months ago. And we're sort of putting things to bed around integrated circuits, because when we find them, we buy them and we have significant inventory to buffer us. Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. And then... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer But I think we're close enough to 2022 that I think clearly supply chain issues in corporate America or industrial America aren't done. Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay. And then just on price. If we snap the line on all the increases you've announced or are planning to announce, like is a 4% kind of favorable price, a good starting point to think about for 2022? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, we're going to get significant price. I mean, math that I'll give you is what we said on the call, which was in the script. We got 4% in Q3, resi was up 5% and we guided at 1.30 for the full year. If you do the math, which you will when you have time, through Q3 we're up about $70 million. And so that implies we're going to get over 6% price as a corporation in fourth quarter. Now that's going to be the best run rate quarter, but we still -- you think about second, third and the fourth quarter price increases this year, we're going to have lots of carrier we're building into next year. Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst Okay, great. Thanks. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Next we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, John. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst Can you just pick up on price a little bit more. So it sounds like we should expect a normal kind of December-ish, January-ish bump of some reasonable magnitude also? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, we -- what we tried to convey in the call or on the script was we've already announced commercial up to 13% effective, I think January 1. And the resi guys are just sort of putting the final wraps on things to probably aggregate me because I want to communicate probably on their own. But we're going to announce something similar for resi effective January 1. And then refrigeration already went out both in Europe and the U.S. in December with pricing -- for pricing increases effective December. So yes, there is another way that's effective in essence at the end of the year. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst And I wonder if you could actually update us on the succession process, where that's at? Any other kind of update on expected timing or anything? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think it's as is. I mean, the search is ongoing, board is fully into it. And when we have something to say, we'll announce it. I think it's a long and short of it. Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator And we'll go to Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst Hey, thanks. So first off, when do you expect to shift the $150 million of pushed revs? And was the majority in commercial or what's the rough split? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I'll answer the second part of the question. I'm not sure of the first part of the question. But the second part of the question is, in third quarter, it was more residential -- excuse me, more commercial than residential. And then the fourth quarter will be more residential than commercial. And sort of the split is like 60-40. So third quarter is 60% commercial, 40% resi. And then next quarter it's the flip. And then what's the first part of the question, when we're going to ship it? Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst Yeah. When you're going to reduce it and shift the push, yeah. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think it's sort of just -- I think what's happening -- short answer is in fourth quarter, right? So there's sort of a bubble that moves through the system. And so the things we couldn't ship in fourth -- third quarter, we ship in fourth quarter. I think we will see in AHRI data when it comes out that third and fourth quarter will sort of be muted quarters industrywide in units, i.e., it will be flat to down. And I think what that will mean is, we've all had trouble producing, as I suggested, and we're sort of at the end of the season. And while some of the demand is being picked up by Watsco and people have some things, but I think broadly what's happening is the lead times from local dealers to install HVAC or air conditioners is long enough that people are deferring the replacement until the summer season in many parts of the country. Not in Phoenix, not in Miami, but in many parts of the country I think people are deferring. So I think there will be a bow wave when we enter or when we get into 2022 and production picks up and we start to enter the summer selling season next year. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. And then for my follow-up, you hit on this a little, Todd, but can you talk about the newer strategies you're implementing to offset the supply issues and COVID? And is there a timeline you can share for when the company is going to see improvements from initiatives? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think the answer is, the timeline was a month ago. So we're already seeing significant improvements from the initiatives. It's like I said, it just takes a while for it all to flow through the P&L. So I would have said the peak of disruption in our business was August, early September and we're now past that peak. And the things that we're doing is, we have I want to say tens of millions of dollars, maybe it's a little less than that, just feels like that of inventory of integrated circuits. We're buying 18 months a year of an integrated circuit inventory. We're sort of taking our MCR engineering team and focus them on qualifying new suppliers. And we're spending lots of times with key suppliers. So I think the major ones are behind us, but again, this thing is a bit of a bumpy ride and we're trying to work through it and things are getting better. But if our motor suppliers calls on the phone and say they have an issue, we got to work through it quickly. And we had those phone calls, we had compressors. I never thought I'd live in a world where pallets would be short, but they are and we've worked through that also. So I think the answer is, the financial news is -- I'm repeating myself for the fifth time, I know. The financial news is still bad in Q4 around this issue, but operationally, we're much better. It just takes a while for the inventory -- the cost caught up in inventory to work its way to the system. Ryan Merkel -- William Blair -- Analyst That's helpful. Thanks. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Hey, Josh. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Todd, just to kind of pick up that last comment on some of the good work has already been done and it's just a matter of time. I mean, I guess, maybe specifically in the commercial, not to get ahead of ourselves on '22 guidance. But can margins start to kind of flatten out or go up on a year-over-year basis in the first half next year or do we need to kind of fully lap annually some of these dynamics before stuff gets better? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I'll be honest with you, Josh. I'm not trying to be coy, I haven't -- I don't have that -- I can't see that math in my head. But I think the answer -- I'll just make a third quarter comment. The fact we're down 800 basis points in the quarter, that's a one-off and we'll be back. What I do know is, on a full year basis, we expect margins to increase in commercial next year from this year. Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then on the refrigerant dynamic that you talked about in resi, I think you're one of the only OEMs out there that's sort of pointing to that as a specific driver, Watsco included, hasn't really noticed that per se. But anything that you can sort of put around that number-wise that's kind of driving that delta to the consumer? And maybe just kind of a side point, I remember, 10 years ago, recycling was supposed to be a big thing, like why isn't that kind of stepped in to fill in some of the supply or shortages there? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think Watsco is talking about it too. I think everyone close to the business understands it. But I'll give you an example. So your house, Josh, you're getting a big unit. So you're getting a 5 ton unit for that 8,000 square feet you're having your house. And sort of the difference between a 5 ton air conditioner, right now, the refrigerant charge, if you buy R22 and assume there's three pounds of charge per ton, it cost you about $2,300 for the refrigerant. It's about $153 per ton. And for a 410A unit, it's about $1,100 because it's about $70 per ton of refrigerant. So there's about $1,000 difference for a 5 ton unit of buying -- of recharging a refrigerant. So I have a unit that leaks. I have a bad coil. And someone comes out and says, OK, it's $2,200 for me to put the refrigerant back in plus there is some labor with that or I can sell you a whole new system for $5,000. And by the way, that's only $1,000 refrigerant charge that's baked into that and you get a 10-year warranty and you get more efficiency. Those are the conversations that are taking place. And dealers know this, they're very, very good at this. And there is recycling that takes place, but it's the art. It's just supply and demand and the R22 spiked up and it will continue to spike up. Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. I think we're more like a Westinghouse Electric fan borne over ice cubes, but a good example. Thanks. Operator Our next question is from Patrick Brogan with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Patrick Brogan -- J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst Yeah, hi. Good morning, Todd. Good morning, Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just looking at the fourth quarter and the guidance for organic sales, it looks flattish in terms of the year-over-year, and I think you said price is about 6% and then you have a days sales impact which pulls down the revenue by 6%. I guess, I'm coming at it and looking at I guess you're assuming flattish on volume. And my question -- on a selling days adjusted basis that is. And my question is really, what's your visibility to kind of improving that volume growth rate in the fourth quarter versus what it looked like was kind of low-to-mid single-digit decline on volume in the third quarter? They just seem like from your comments you're not really embedding improvement from like the disruptions from COVID and supply chain. So maybe it's availability related to furnaces versus AC or something like that? Just kind of curious if you could give some color on that? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer No, I think it's tied to what I said. I mean, we entered the -- we're already almost a month through the quarter and we entered low on inventory. And so I'm -- my comments were around our production ability -- our production capabilities. And so they are materially better than what they were a month ago and even more better than they were two or three months ago. So I mean, the guide is the guide, but our production capabilities -- but we're getting these issues behind us. Patrick Brogan -- J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst Okay. Got it. The issues are behind, but the impact from the disruptions aren't changed... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I said the issues are getting behind us, right? I didn't say it's fair, it's getting behind us. And then I said the costs hangs up on the balance sheet and then you have to enter the quarter with the inventory to be able to sell and you sort of catch-up as you go along. And so that's the issues that we face. Patrick Brogan -- J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst Okay. Thanks for the color. And then my follow-up is on commercial HVAC, and I wrote this down quickly, so I just want to obviously confirm these numbers. But I think you said emergency replacement down 30 and planned replacement up 20. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about the drivers behind that? And since it was emergency replacement that was down a lot, doesn't that -- isn't that by definition just hard to kind of recapture? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I didn't say we're going to recapture emergency replacement. So I didn't say that, but I don't disagree with that. But what it reflects is, we're protecting our National Accounts, which is by the way, higher margin business for us. So we [Indecipherable] we're going after it. And yes, it's hard to replace emergency replacement, but what I said earlier is, I think others are having similar issue. So we'll sort of see what the market share shakeout is. Patrick Brogan -- J.P. Morgan Securities -- Analyst Understood. Thanks for the color. I appreciate the time. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator The next question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll -- Stephens -- Analyst Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, Tommy. Tommy Moll -- Stephens -- Analyst Todd, it sounds like the pricing environment is still rather constructive. So I'm just curious, is there any sign of that momentum diminishing? Is there any lack of discipline among the players in the industry? And what's your confidence level that you can keep price cost neutral into 2022? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, it still remains constructive. I think that's southern understatement, Tommy. I mean, our price, I'd say it's going to be up over 6%, that's more than constructive. So the answer is, we're aggressively getting price. We're offsetting it this year even when we're sort of on our flat-footed going into it. But this year, we're going to get $130 million of price. Commodities is $80 million; LIFO, which is an FX cost $15 million; freight is $5 million; tariffs are $5 million, that all adds up to $105 million. And so we're more than offsetting those inflationary pressures this year, and we even do have a better performance next year. Tommy Moll -- Stephens -- Analyst Perhaps, it was a little understatement there. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, thank you. It's a tough quarter, Tommy. You got to be helping me here. You can't be piling on. Tommy Moll -- Stephens -- Analyst Wanted to ask a follow-up on the SG&A line. Just anything you would do to level set us on any comparisons next year versus this year that may be squarely, whether they'd be favorable or unfavorable or should we think about next year as best you know today? Where that line should deliver typical type of incremental as we've been accustomed to expect? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think broadly I would say that -- I think sort of high levels things I think about is salary increases may be up a hair more than normal given sort of inflationary pressures that we're all seeing and labor issues that we see. I think that's probably true. Even though we've taken a step down second half of the year on a full -- we had a really, really strong first half of the year. So on a full year basis, incentive comp is up above target this year. And so we'll get a benefit next year when we rebaseline it. And we'll continue to make the investments in products and in distribution and in IT like we always do. So I think that's a long-winded way of saying there's some puts and takes. But I would end up where you started with as I would sort of look at a model over the last couple of years of SG&A increases or sort of going up plus in revenue, and that's what I would bake in. Tommy Moll -- Stephens -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, Todd. I'll turn it back. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator And next we'll go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Good morning. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst So maybe just parsing out those price cost comments just a little further, Todd. So you mentioned the 6 points in the fourth quarter. I mean, should we be thinking about that as kind of like a run rate then into the next maybe the first half of 2022? And obviously, cost curves are starting to come down. So at what point do you think you start to get the benefit of that spread widening into next year? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think the cost curves are coming down much slower than I thought. So steel is still pretty high. Copper is down a little bit, but steel is -- and the aluminum is down a little bit, but steel is where we're most exposed at this point as we move away from to a large degree copper coils. So I think it starts to take a while to unwind. I think over -- given the carry forward and the timing of things this year, commodities will still be up, at least we're planning for commodities and our cost structure given that we hedge and buy steel based on different formats to include prior CRU pricing -- prior quarter CRU share you pricing. We still expect commodities, on a year-over-year basis, next year to be up significantly. And we're pricing, that's why we passed on a significant price increase at the end of the year. So we're going to have headwinds again next year. We're really confident we're going to offset them with price though. And I think the answer to your question, the price increase of last year or beginning of the year second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. So yeah, we'll have some nice tailwind first half of the year. Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess, maybe my one follow on, and you've kind of referred to resi replacement being down mid-single-digit to Tom's like supply chain certainly impacted that to some degree and this conversation just around kind of R22 and the potential replacement. I guess, any other color that you can provide in terms of just what's left to replace? I don't know if you guys have dug into that any further. And how to think about kind of like this resi replacement market as we head into 2022? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I understand the question. I mean, we haven't done the math on the 2005 to 2010, that 60% R22. But I would -- when you think about 2009, 2010 even 2008, there is a lot of those units still out there. I mean, they don't -- they're under warranty up until last year or the year before depending on the time slice. And so people just get it fixed. So those units are out there and systems are out there. And so I think it's a major driver of demand, significant driver of demand. Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Okay. That's great. Thanks guys. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Next question, Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Good morning. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey. Gautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Nobody asked about IAQ, so I figured I might as well. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of inquiries? How big it is maybe in the Commercial business? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I mean, it still remains important. But I'll be honest with you, I mean, it sort of gets pushed a little bit to the side given the other issues that we have and how we're taking care of customers and how we're prioritizing customers. So the biggest market for us is probably schools and low-rise office buildings and inquiries are still strong in resi, it's still important part. But as you know, I've been a little less bullish than others. So when I think about our opportunities going into 2022, I mean, we'll drive and we're focused on it, but some of these other issues are obviously much more important. Gautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Can you remind us what the incremental ticket size is if you do sell a system with IAQ add-ons? What is a portion... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. If you do it on the resi system, it can be 20% or so. On a commercial system, probably less than that, 10 to 20. If you sort of get the full package, if you get everything. If you just do more filter, if you just upgrade filters, it's probably 3% or 4% or 5% that's UV lights that's sort of the whole thing. Gautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst That's helpful. Thank you. And Todd, just to be clear on the Q3 and Q4 impacts from COVID, is that almost entirely a commercial issue or did it also impact the resi facility in South Carolina or Iowa? You mentioned, Saltillo was a little more resilient, but... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer The factories that had impacted the most in order to the business was Arkansas, our Arkansas factory which is commercial, but our Mississippi residential factory and our Lawrenceburg, South Carolina residential factory. So really sort of two resi factories and then the commercial factory. And again, we think about lots of criteria where we put our factories. I know I will offend people when I say this, but I'm going to say it anyhow. I mean, we never had a criteria where people believe in science, right? And in the southern factories, our vaccine rates are much, much lower than they are in other parts of the country, as you would expect. The society reflects that. And so we've had to run some of these factories with 20%, 30% vaccine rates. Gautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst And last question for me. You mentioned the mix dynamics, is it also true that the higher MCR systems have more electronic components and therefore more kind of at-risk of pinch points from the supply chain relative to the entry level CR products or is that not true? Does that also have an impact on the mix just to supply... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer That's probably fair. I mean, I simplified it as thinking about it as production site that Mexico did better than Marshalltown, Iowa and we had lower mix there. But I think you're probably right, both around variable speed and around control systems. So my guess is, you're probably right. If I dug in, that will probably part of the answer. Gautam Khanna -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Next we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Yeah. Nigel Coe, your line is open, if you're on mute, possibly. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Yeah. Sorry, I was on mute. Sorry about that. Good morning, everyone. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, Nigel. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Hi, Todd. So when we talk about the improving conditions in supply chain sort of real-time, are we talking primarily about labor availability and productivity in the factory? Was it -- is it labor and supply of compressors, motors? And then just sort of a subtext to that would be the commercial impacts on replacement. Was that partly BRF imports from your -- from [Indecipherable] or is that something separate? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I'll answer maybe in reverse order. BRF was up in the quarter, so we weren't really impacted much there. But the emergency replacement was clearly impacted by availability, because we were protecting our large National Accounts. I mean, we had to protect our existing customers before we went after new contractor business with emergency replacement. And what was the first part of the question, Nigel? Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Yeah, it's really just -- is it mainly labor that's gotten benefit... Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, what's behind us. Yeah, yeah. The COVID impact, sort of the unplanned absenteeism, that's sort of behind us at this point. And again, you see it in the southern states COVID case chart. So if you look at New York Times, look at Arkansas, look at South Carolina, look at Mississippi, they're down dramatically and we've seen that in our factories. So supply chain, we still have challenges that we're facing, but it's much better than it was two or three months ago. And I think that's an order inventory positions that we've taken on critical components, investments we've made in qualifying new suppliers, and then the third piece is I think the supply chain itself is healing even if we hadn't taken actions on our own. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst And then the oil companies are talking about some of these rare metals as constraints, so magnesium and other metals, I can't even pronounce, but aluminum alloys are coming up as an issue. I know you're a consumer of aluminum, but any -- sort of what happens there? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer No, not that's on my radar screen yet. I mean, that may pop up in the future. But I think the issue around different metals has impacted the integrated circuit market in some ways, but I mean, we buy straightforward aluminum and straightforward cold-rolled steel. So we're not buying anything exotic, but that doesn't mean there might not be issues in the future. But right now, that's not an issue with us. And you know the auto guys slowing down has helped us with aluminum and steel, as you might imagine. And so that has actually helped us. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Okay, great. And then, Todd, can we just address once again the CEO search. I mean, you're not -- you're committed to the company till mid-2022. So would you describe the search right now as intense? So is there a time -- you have still time on your hands? I mean, are we talking about weeks, months? Any color there would be helpful. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, it's intense. I think we all understand that once you announce something like this, the sooner you move on the better. And I got my wheels -- I got my hands on the wheel and I'm driving as hard as I can and fighting every day. But as soon as I get somebody then the transition will take place. And so it's intense and we're trying to get it done as quick as we can or to better say, the board is trying to get it done as quick as they can. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Got it. Okay. Thanks, Todd. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Our next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, John. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Hey, John. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hey. Just wanted to come at the cost side of price cost a little differently here. Obviously, this year demand has been I think better for the market than folks expected. So we've heard there might have been a little bit more spot buying of some of the commodities. Just curious if you would characterize this year as unusual on how much you buy in the spot market. I'm just thinking about next year what you might have unhedged in terms of commodities versus what you had unhedged this year in terms of the commodities? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think I understand the questions. I'm going to ramble around it and maybe directly touch on it and touch other areas. I think the inflationary pressures have hit us, to your point, of buying on the spot in different ways, but I think I broadly -- not broadly, I communicated that commodities are still going to be up significantly next year is the way we see it going forward. I think the other way that that come up -- inflationary pressures has hurt us in a way that we typically don't talk about is material cost reduction is usually 20, 25 -- $20 million to $30 million a year where net cost we're taking out. This year, it's closer to breakeven and the delta isn't that we aren't doing cost reduction, we are. The delta is that people are passing on price increases to us. So we're also seeing pricing pressure from suppliers who are passing on things that have steel in it and have aluminum in it and they're passing it out on to us. And so when we go into next year, we'll have -- we'll also not have our normal material cost reduction year, but again, we're able to offset that aggressively with price and that's why we're seeing the new price at the end of this year. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Thank you for that. And then maybe just one on heat pumps. Are they a meaningful -- are they a big enough part of the mix yet that they would have a mix impact if there is actually one from heat pumps? I don't know if they're actually accretive or dilutive to the overall margin for Lennox. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think they are roughly in line with the margin. If we sell heat pump system with an outdoor heat pump and an indoor air handler, it's not dissimilar to the margins that we get if we sell in AC outdoor and a furnace indoor, and it's a meaningful part. It's from memory a third or so industrywide and with us of our total cooling capacity, our heat pumps. So it's a meaningful part of our business and we've made significant investments, as I've spoken about. We're coming out with a cold weather or cold reach in heat pump that allows you to buy them as far north as Canada and still have them be energy efficient and appropriate. And so we've made significant investments. I would have said five years ago we lagged the industry. I'd say now we've caught up and maybe even ahead of people maybe not sort of a carrier who has made significant investments, but almost everybody else we're ahead of. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll pass it on. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks. Operator Our final question will be from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi, good morning, everyone. Joseph W. Reitmeier -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Good morning. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Hey, Joe. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst First, I just want to understand on Mexico. Is it strictly just you've had fewer COVID issues for disruptions there or is there anything else about Mexico and supply chain that has made that a more favorable place to be kind of manufacturing through what we've seen in the supply chain environment so far? And does that continue to pay dividends as you increase your capacity when that factory comes online? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I think one is COVID that we were less hit there than we were certainly in our other factories in south of the Mason-Dixon line in the U.S. I think God then was probably on to something that I hadn't articulated that. I think the more entry-level product has less integrated circuits. So it's less at risk. And then the third is just some sort of basic areas like steel supply, pallet supply, the suppliers that we used for Mexico were more robust, happen to be more robust. I don't think it's structurally any answer that says Mexico is a better place to be for that reason. But the way it worked out, they in fact were. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Okay. And then a question on emergency replacement. I just wonder as you get kind of more connected equipment and more data and maybe more preventive maintenance, does that just become less of an opportunity in the marketplace for share shift over time? Are you seeing that where you can better protect share because you're not losing it out if there is an emergency replacement someone tries swoop in and get that? Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer I don't think so, because in a sense, emergency replacement tends to be entry-level product, electromechanical controls, they're not monitoring it, we're monitoring it. They turn it on when it's hot, they turn it off when it's cold and then it breaks and they call us. So I don't think we're going to remote monitor that in any meaningful way that will impact demand if people -- if any -- if customers sort of thinking about remote monitoring then we're usually able to trade them up to a better unit. Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Got it. Thanks a lot. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Good. Thank you. Operator Now Mr. Bluedorn, I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments. Todd M. Bluedorn -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Thanks a lot. To wrap up, we're battling through supply chain disruptions today, but also positioning the company for the future. We carry strong pricing power into 2022 to offset inflationary pressure. Looking at market drivers and our strong backlog position and order rates, we see Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration markets up in 2022. As we get more and more of the supply chain disruptions behind us, we expect to return to strong growth and profitability as we capitalize on market opportunities. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Operator [Operator Closing Remarks] Duration: 59 minutes Call participants: Steve Harrison -- Vice President, Investor Relations Todd M.

    "full_description": "What happened Shares of Carnival ( NYSE:CCL ) ( NYSE:CUK ) fell 2% as of 1:39 a.m. EDT Monday after the cruise company got hit with a downgrade from analysts at Citigroup . Citi cut its rating on Carnival stock from buy to neutral and slashed its price target to $24.50. Image source: Getty Images. So what Citi's price target cut implies there's still about 12% upside in Carnival stock -- that's the good news. The bad news is that the cut also implies a 28% decline in the analyst's estimate of Carnival's total value. As Citi explains in a note covered by The Fly today, it remains of the opinion that the cruise industry as a whole is on the road to recovery. But, according to the note, \"Carnival has delivered slower revenue and earnings growth over the last 10 years\" than has rival Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ( NYSE:NCLH ) , and Citi sees no reason to believe this dynamic will reverse as the cruise industry emerges from recession. To the contrary, Citi worries that Carnival's decision to sell off some of its \"older, less efficient vessels\" to cut costs when cruise lines were forbidden from cruising, combined with its having fewer new ships on order, \"will limit its revenue recovery versus Norwegian.\" Now what Unsurprisingly then, given the analyst's continued belief that cruise lines in general are recovering, Citi argues that Norwegian Cruise \"will deliver more attractive returns to shareholders relative to Carnival.\" And so at the same time as the banker is downgrading Carnival stock, Citi is initiating coverage of Norwegian Cruise stock with a buy rating. And I have to say -- I agree with Citigroup on this one. While personally I'm not yet convinced that any cruise lines are bargains worth buying, the fact remains: Based on consensus forecasts, Norwegian Cruise stock currently sells for just 36.4 times forward earnings, versus more than 95 times earnings for Carnival. Norwegian's also carrying a lot less debt than its rival -- less than $10 billion net of cash on hand, versus nearly $25 billion in net debt for Carnival -- giving Norwegian more room to maneuver during the recovery. All things considered, Norwegian seems a safer port in the cruise stocks storm.",

    "description": "With supply chain issues and shortages, Cincinnati Chef Jose Salazar posted the prices of what food products are today compared to what they were as recently as six months to a year ago - the difference is stunning.",
    "content": "Chef Jose Salazar, an award-winner who owns three restaurants in the Cincinnati area, took to Instagram on Saturday to show why the prices on restaurant menus have grown over the last year.With supply chain issues and shortages, Salazar posted to Instagram the prices of what common food products are priced today compared to what they were as recently as six months to a year ago. The difference is concerning, and Salazar says it could mean bankruptcy for local restaurants if inflation doesn't fall or the government doesn't intervene. Many of the everyday products restaurants use are three-times the price they were a year ago. Restaurants, which survive on thin margins as a nature of the business, are now facing tougher choices as inflation is exploding costs among common goods. \"Right now a lot of restaurants are barely surviving,\" Salazar told WCPO 9 on Monday. \"(They're) only still in business because we got help from the government with Paycheck Protection Program money. I can't speak to other restaurateurs, but we aren't turning a profit right now. We are using money we have left from PPP to sustain us.\" The owner of Salazar, Mitas, and Goose and Elder said the story they've been told from suppliers is a lack of labor to get products shipped, delivered and driven from warehouses to customers. Shippers are passing the costs onto restaurants, who in turn have to gamble with how much of the cost they have to pass on to customers and how much of it they absorb.\"Look at to-go packaging,\" Salazar said. \"If I say we are going to charge you an extra $5 for every to-go order, I don't know if it would fly. The steak that cost us $13-14 a pound is costing us $20 a pound today. I can't raise it that much. I can maybe get away with a 10-percent increase.\" Salazar said Congress has several bills to help small businesses and restaurants in the pipeline, but so far none have gained traction. He said customers for the most part have been understanding of the price increases, and he hasn't heard complaints. \"We're thankful for the support,\" Salazar said. \"Hopefully things will level-out, and we can lower prices again and get back to some level of normalcy. I'm not hearing anything positive right now. All of our purveyors are saying they don't see an end in sight. Maybe if people could persuade Congress to at least shed a light on what we are dealing with.\"ProductPrice TodayPrice 12 months agoChangeChange by PercentFryer Oil$45$21$24114%Chicken Wings per case$175$45$130288%Take-Out Boxes$95$25$70280%Source: Chef Jose SalazarRELATED: Restaurant industry looks to working moms during staff shortageRELATED: Amid labor shortage, Raising Cane’s is asking corporate staff to work in restaurants",

    "full_description": "Facebook for years has reportedly struggled to crack down on human traffickers using its platforms, leaked documents show. Facebook has known about human traffickers using its platforms since at least 2018, according to CNN . The issues got so bad that in 2019, Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from the App Store, which would have been devastating to the company. Internally, Facebook employees scrambled to remove problematic posts and made emergency policy changes to being blocked from the App Store, which they described as a “potentially severe” consequence for the company, according to CNN. While Facebook managed to dodge the App Store ban, it continues to struggle with human-trafficking issues to this day, the documents reportedly show. An internal Facebook report from earlier this year noted that “gaps still exist in our detection of on-platform entities engaged in domestic servitude,” according to CNN. Domestic servitude is “a form of trafficking of people for the purpose of working inside private homes through the use of force, fraud, coercion or deception,” CNN reported. The internal report also detailed how Facebook’s platforms are used to recruit, buy and sell what Facebook describes internally as “domestic servants.” Redacted versions of the leaked documents, which were shared in formal complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as Congress , were then shared with a consortium of news organizations, including Reuters, which are expected to publish a slew of stories Monday. Last week, using search terms listed in Facebook’s internal documents on the subject, CNN said it was able to find active Instagram accounts that appeared to offer domestic workers for sale. Facebook removed the accounts and posts after CNN asked about them, and spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed to the outlet that they violated its policies. “We prohibit human exploitation in no uncertain terms,” Stone said. “We’ve been combating human trafficking on our platform for many years and our goal remains to prevent anyone who seeks to exploit others from having a home on our platform.” Shares of Facebook were up slightly at $325.67 Monday afternoon after falling more than 5 percent in the last trading session on Friday.",

Jason Moser: [MUSIC] It's Monday, October 18th. I'm your host, Jason Moser. If you caught last week's Financials show, then you heard our earnings preview for the big banks. This week, we're jumping into what they all had to say with our earnings review here to make sense of it at all. It's the one, it's the only certified financial planner Mr. Matt Frankel. Matt, how is everything going? Matt Frankel: Just fine it's a nice, sunny and not-too-hot day in South Carolina. You only get a few of those before winter, our fall is like a week long. Moser: It's contagious, it's throughout that way up here to Virginia, it's really nice sunny day, cool outside seems like it's really starting to turn into fall, which I think we're all kind of happy about. You get some Halloween decorating done over the weekend. My kids are very proud of what I put out there this year. Frankel: Our house is all decorated and we have a golf cart, so one of my kids' favorite things to do this time of year as drive around the neighborhood on the golf cart looking at all the decorations. [laughs] Moser: Nice, good deal. Well, Matt, we were talking last week about all of the banks that we're getting ready to announce earnings as earnings season has gotten underway here. We wanted to circle back this week and then take a look at these reports and see if there were any underlying themes and just generally see how these banks are doing. It has been a much different year, I would say, this year versus last for these big banks. We're having a very good year to date for the most part and a good trailing 12 months, too when you look at the performance for these big five. Let's just go in order here. We'll take JPMorgan first because they announced last Wednesday. What stood out to you in JPMorgan's report? We're always paying a little bit, I think closer attention because of Jamie Dimon, but what's stood out to you in JPMorgan's most recent quarter? Frankel: There are a few common themes among all of these earnings reports, they were all generally good first of all. All five of the banks we're going to talk about beat earnings expectations, which is pretty impressive. There were a lot of reserve releases, which is one of the things we mentioned in the preview show last week if you remember. Banks have more visibility into their loan losses now, now that COVID is, I don't want to say winding down, but definitely we're moving on with life in general. Moser: We're in a much different place now than we were before and it's much better situation for sure. Frankel: Right. Just to run down JPMorgan, they had a $2.1 billion reserve release. The reason I'm mentioning that first is because that was a big part of its earnings beat. It beat expectations and it earned $3.74 a share versus $3 EBITDA was the expectation. But over $0.50 of those earnings were in the form of a reserve release. The beat wasn't as good as it sounds, but it was still more than expected. Revenue grew 2% year over year, which is nice considering that interest rates are still pretty low. Revenue came in higher than expected. Jamie Dimon who you mentioned, gave his thoughts on the economy and said he is really impressed with the economic growth despite the delta variant making us go backward a little bit during the third quarter. I would call the second quarter really the reopening quarter of the year. Whereas the third quarter, I don't want to say it was a shutdown quarter, but things definitely took a pause a little bit in terms of reopening in August and September. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: Interest income was actually better than expected, which is really nice to see. Net interest income came in about $200 million more than expectations called for. Moser: Wow. Frankel: Which remember, interest rates are still pretty low. They started to pick up during the third quarter, but still very low historically. In the investment banking side of it, investment banking revenue was up 50% year over year. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: That's strong M&A and IPO market that we mentioned during the preview. One potential negative, JPMorgan was the only bank that missed on some of its trading revenue and investment banking. They missed on the fixed-income side, they came in well below expectations. They beat on the equities trading sides, so that kind of evened it out, but still something to watch. We've talked about it many times, how trading revenue is like the least predictable type of banking income. But in general, overall loan portfolio is up 5% year over year. Jamie Dimon called the loan growth \"stabilized,\" which is nice because remember, loans were declining for a little while there. Deposits are up 19% year over year. Overall, really good quarter. Moser: Yes. The deposit number, we'll talk, I think, a little bit about that with the Bank of America as well. That's one of those things that can help, I think, that net interest income because typically, there was this higher deposits which were essentially zero-interest deposits for the most part. That gives them a little bit more to work with, so to speak, they're bringing in a little bit more than they have to pay out on that slide. One thing I noticed, and I want to just get your quick feelings on this, there is a question on the call in regard to the supply chain disruptions. I mean it's not just semiconductors, that's virtually everything. We're hearing, you better get holiday shopping now. We're seeing Amazon , Walmart , Target , they're all going to start rolling out these holiday shopping promotions early. Dimon seems to think, listen, he didn't think we are going to be talking much about these stuff in a year. Then maybe we are focusing on it a little bit too much right now that it's dampening a fairly good economy, not reversing a fairly good economy. Do you feel like maybe he's a little bit blasé about this? He kind of just glosses over it, but I mean, I don't know, it seems to me like he's not as concerned with it or he certainly feels like there are others out there who remain concerned this could well into next year. Frankel: I feel like the supply chain disruptions have already lasted longer than a lot of people thought. The holiday season it could be interesting and it's not just supply chain, it's a labor shortage, too. What happens every year around the holiday season, companies like Target and Amazon, hire tens of thousands of seasonal workers. They're going to have trouble doing that this year. You're not only going to have competition for products, but you're going to have bigger crowds than these stores' employees can handle in a lot of cases. That's something to watch, too. But I see it clearing up early in 2022. I agree with him on that point. Moser: Good enough. Well let's move on to Bank of America. Again, I know this is a bank that you follow closely, a bank you like, it seemed like it was a pretty good quarter. Frankel: Yeah. I'm going to sound like a broken record in some of these just because [laughs] I always age myself with that phrase, broken record. Most people listening don't know what a record is. Moser: Vinyl's making a come back. [LAUGHTER] Want's some little piece vinyl. Frankel: Broken record is something that repeats itself for young ones out there. [LAUGHTER] Bank of America beat on both earnings and revenue. They beat expectations on both. Earnings were up 58% year over year, which is really nice because remember there weren't these big reserve releases last year, things like that. It was more going the other direction, banks were setting aside money in anticipation that things were going to get bad. Bank of America released $1.1 billion in the quarter. Not quite as much of a reserve release as JPMorgan, but still over a billion dollars. A billion is a billion. Net interest income grew 10% year over year, which was nice to see, given that the interest rates, like I mentioned, are just starting to tick up, which was much better than expected. Annualized loan growth is up 9% quarter over quarter. I think that was the best out of the big banks. Their loan portfolio is growing nicely led by commercial lending, which was nice to see. Meaning companies are willing to borrow and spend money more than people thought. Investment banking fee incomes up 23% year over year. Advisory revenues, M&A, and equity underwriting, which is IPOs, were the strongest parts. That part was up 65% year over year and they beat their trading revenue which is, like I've said, notoriously tough to predict, beat on both the fixed income and the equity side, unlike JPMorgan Chase. Really solid quarter if I were to give JPMorgan a B for the quarter, I'd give Bank of America probably a B plus or A minus. Moser: One thing that stood out to me, they have 41 million customers now using their digital platform, which I'll just tell you from the perspective of one of those 41 million and we've been Bank of America customers for a long time, one of the reasons we are Bank of America customers, frankly is just a headache trying to switch banks. But, even if I wanted to, which we don't, I think that's the key there is that we really have no reason to. The service is good. We think the digital platform is good. It just feels like that's such a sticky form of engagement that will keep people in that universe. It really is very user-friendly digital platform, which to me it feels like they're only going to continue to make those investments and grow that capability up. Frankel: Well out of the five we're talking about, I feel like Bank of America took the lead on investing in technology. Moser: It feels to me that way as well. Yeah. Frankel: I'm a Wells Fargo customer and Wells Fargo has a nice, user-friendly app and platform. I use Bank of America for our business account related to my real estate investing. It's a better platform, it just is. It's more user-friendly and you could tell that they spent the money. Moser: Yep. Indeed. Speaking of Wells Fargo, it feels like things are slowly but surely coming back online for them. Stock continues to have a good year and it feels like this was a pretty good, maybe nothing terribly noteworthy, but it felt like it was pretty good quarter, it kept them going in the right direction. Matt Frankel: Yeah, it was a strong quarter. Like I said, I would've given JPMorgan a B, I would've given Bank of America probably a B plus or A minus, Wells Fargo will get like a B minus to a C. Not a bad quarter, but like you said, nothing terribly great. They beat earnings expectations, most of that was because of a reserve release. They released $1.65 billion. Remember, Wells Fargo is the most consumer-facing out of the five, meaning they're not really focused on the investment bank. They loan money, that's how they make their money. Net interest income was down 5% year over year. Remember I mentioned Bank of America's was up 10%, so their interest income is trending in the opposite direction, which is concerning. That's probably the biggest ding on the quarter. One thing that's really impressive, they spend $5.3 billion on buybacks in the third quarter alone. Moser: Wow. Frankel: That's an aggressive buyback pace. Moser: That is. Frankel: I don't have the figure in front of me, but I want to say Wells Fargo's total market cap is in the $200 billion range. Moser: Yeah, that sounds about right. Frankel: That means say they bought back more than the 2.5% of their share count in the third quarter alone. Moser: Yeah, $193 billion I'm seeing right now on Capital IQ. Frankel: That's a big buyback pace. Moser: It is. Frankel: Consumer loans still down year over year, down 2% from the second quarter. Not terribly concerning about in line with peers. Deposits continue to rise and Wells Fargo's nicely profitable, that return on equity of 11.1%, which is above that magical 10% threshold. Strong quarter but nothing to jump up and down in the street about. Moser: Do you feel like the headwinds that they're facing in on the net interest income side, you feel like that's partly due to the fact that regulators are still keeping the growth lid on, so to speak. There's still not able really to grow. You're not going to bring those deposits. We see with JPMorgan and Bank of America for example, there's robust deposit growth numbers. Wells is going to be limited in what they can do there. You feel like that's something that plays into that net interest income. If so, then it feels like maybe that's a bit more of a short-term concern as opposed to a long-term one. Frankel: Absolutely. When their peers are growing their deposit base at 20% year over year, like in some of these cases. JPMorgan's was up 19% year over year. Wells Fargo's was up less than 4% year over year. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: When you have that big difference in deposit growth, of course, it gives the other banks an advantage to generate more interest because it gives them more money to lend. Even if their loan portfolio is not necessarily growing as fast as they like it to, it still gives them that big capital base to lend out and make money, so Wells Fargo, that's definitely a handicap for them right now. Moser: Do you think going forward that these banks and I'm going to pick on Bank of America and JPMorgan and Wells specifically here, just because these numbers are so large. These reserve releases and there are no surprise we've been talking about them for a year, waiting for this to essentially happen. It feels like though they're going to have to wean themselves of that crotch. Again, I don't know how much more they can release in order to impact the bottom line, so to speak, it feels like going forward, maybe there's going to be a little bit more of a burden on these banks to start growing again. They are going to certainly need to see that interest rate environment improve a little bit, but it feels like they can't rely on these reserve releases much longer. What about Citigroup stood out to you this quarter, Matt? Frankel: It was nice, it was a good quarter. Nothing terribly impressive. Their loan portfolio was flat year over year, except you have nothing really to report there. Moser: Right. Frankel: Pretty strong deposit growth. Middle of the pack, 7% year-over-year deposit growth. Earnings came in ahead of expectations, were up 48% year over year. Revenue beat expectations, both sides of trading beat expectations. They're the only major bank with a return on equity below 10% though, they're at 9.5 right now and their overall revenue declined by one percent year-over-year. Not a fantastic quarter, but another one I would probably give a C to. Moser: That's a pretty card-heavy bank isn't it? That's more card exposure than the others. Frankel: They are very card-heavy bank and they're a very international heavy bank. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: I know they have the most international exposure out of any of the five banks we're talking about. That's something that's also been weighing on them. If you're an international bank and a lot of these international markets have been hit much worse than the U.S. in the past year or so. They rely on international commerce which is at a disadvantage right now. Moser: Yeah. Absolutely. Frankel: I'd give it a C. Nothing great, nothing too bad. Moser: Goldman Sachs wrapped it up for us on Friday morning when they announced their quarterly results. I mean, clearly Goldman is a more investment banking centric idea there. Now, we can't hold that against them because it looks like investment banking revenue for Goldman did pretty darn well this past quarter, Matt. Frankel: Yeah. They had a pretty strong quarter. Earnings up 63% year over year and that's not due to reserve releases. That just because their business is making tons of money. Revenue grew 26% year over year. Goldman trades at 7.5 times trailing-12-month earnings right now. 7.5 times earnings. Not many stocks in the market can do that. Moser: No. [laughs] Frankel: Investment banking revenue, you mentioned up 88% year over year. They beat expectations pretty much across the board throughout their business. They're trying to pivot away from investment banking. Remember, they are building out their credit card business, they have the Apple Card, they have some General Motors credit card business. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: They are acquiring a fintech render called GreenSky that should close in the first quarter of next year. That part of the business, it's still just a small part of the total, just doing the quick math in my head, it's about 15% of the business, the consumer and wealth management division. But it's growing fast, it grew 35% year over year, specifically on higher loan balances. All these other banks, their loans were flat, they were down year over year. Goldman's are growing. They're building up the credit card business aggressively. They're doing it in the right way, I mean, Apple's customer base are pretty desirable one to bring into your ecosystem. Goldman Sachs, there's really nothing bad to say about the quarter. One thing I would point out is that Goldman Sachs tends to thrive in unusual times. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: 2021, so far through the first three quarters has been the most they've earned through three quarters in their history. But the previous record was in 2009, when we all remember what was happening in 2009, that's when they made the most money before this because it was a very volatile environment. Their investment banking business does well when companies need to raise capital, when there's a lot of trade, when there is a lot of uncertainty, which is great for trading, not necessarily IPOs, but when companies are making fire sale acquisitions, which we saw a ton of in 2009. Some of these banks made big acquisitions in 2009, and Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, things like that are great for investment banks who facilitate those deals. 2021 has been an unusual year, both in terms of IPO volume. Remember, there has been like something like 500 SPACs or loan that have gone public in 2021. It's been an unusual year, it's been a volatile year, both in good and bad ways and Goldman tends to thrive in those environments. It's unclear how much of their earnings growth is transitory and how much is permanent at this point. But other than that, there's not a whole lot negative to say. Moser: That's a really good point. I mean, you look at the way the company has performed thus far this year, they've grown book value so 17.4% year to date so to your point, yeah. I mean, they're thriving in the uncertainty and that uncertainty just creates a lot of business for them and it feels like that's the way the rest of the year is going to shake out and certainly could be into 2022 as well, but I guess we will have to wait and see. Matt, you were offering some grades along the way and I wanted to get your thoughts on if you look at all five banks and these are banks that you follow closely, you and I talk about these companies a lot. Just based on this most recent quarter, if you had to deem one of these five the winner who won earnings season of the five banks this year? Frankel: I have to give Goldman Sachs an A. Moser: Really? Frankel: With the asterisk that this is not a normal year, that this is a great environment to be a pure investment bank. With that, I'm going to make a bold prediction and say that Goldman Sachs will be $1,000 stock within five years. Moser: Wow. Frankel: Well, I'll actually walk that back and say, I think Goldman Sachs should be $1,000 stock today. Moser: [laughs] Frankel: That would put it at about 22 times earnings which really isn't much of a stretch when you look at the rest of the market. Moser: It feel like it wouldn't be. Frankel: If it turns out they can keep growing their consumer business as they have been and it looks like their investment banking division maintains its lead, I think this could be their time. That's a stock that has not historically gotten the market's love. They had a negative stigma attached to their name for the longest time. They're really trying to renovate or reinvent themselves with their consumer banking division, which they're doing a fantastic job of. I think Goldman Sachs is going to be a big performer, especially as interest rates rise, right now they're building their consumer banking division into a low interest environment. Moser: Yeah. Frankel: As rates rise, I think they could be a big winner in that too. There's a lot to like about it. Moser: This past week's Motley Fool Money , Chris Hill asked me that very same question, I was going over these banks for the show. It's interesting you went with Goldman because I was noodling between two. It was Goldman and Bank of America. Now, I ended up calling out Bank of America as my winner, really I felt like revenue growth, 12%, 15% boosted deposits. I mean, that record investment banking net and there's just a lot to like about the quarter. I figured man, when I was picking Bank of America that Matt Frankel will be proud of me for doing this. There you go picking Goldman so oh, well. Frankel: It's tough to make an argument against Bank of America. Moser: [laughs] I'm just giving you a hard time. I agree. To me, Goldman and Bank of America stood out as real two winners there. I think you're absolutely right Goldman has a lot going for it, so wouldn't shock me to see them continue that success. Matt, before we wrap it up this week, let's give our listeners a couple of financial related companies here, banks or otherwise, with some earnings coming up. What's the stock that you are watching this coming earnings season? Frankel: Can I say all of them? Moser: Sure [laughs] if you want. You got to give you a thesis for each. Frankel: Well, I mentioned that I'm watching SoFi very closely this quarter and I'm going to be watching a lot of these real estate stocks. I don't know if you saw the news today that Zillow is stocking their iBuying business for the rest of the year. Moser: I did see that. Matt Frankel: I want to see if companies like Opendoor with ticker symbol O-P-E-N are having similar issues. They're stopping it because it's going so well. They're too big of a backlog. I want to see if their rivals have a similar thing going. I'll be watching all the iBuying businesses, Zillow, Opendoor , Redfin , etc. Moser: Sounds good. Frankel: I guess that counts as financials, real estate used to be in the financial sector. Moser: We talk about real estate all the time on this show. It absolutely counts. We deem it as worthy on this show for sure. Good. Matt, I'm going to be jumping on a plane on Thursday and I'm flying down to Georgia, flying to Atlanta, drive down to Moultrie, go see my folks for a few days, playing my dad's membered guest down there and so in honor of going down to Moultrie, Georgia, this weekend, keeping an eye on Ameris Bank or I'm sure in Sherman, talk to a couple of the guys down there. But the stock has had a good year up 36%, year to date, up 100% over the last 12 months actually. I am interested to hear their take on commercial real estate, particularly given the fidelity deal that closed back in the middle of 2019. We were talking about Goldman Sachs growing that book value and Ameris continues to grow tangible book value as well noted the last quarter was growing at an annualized rate of 20% for the year. Our earnings for Ameris are out on Oct. 28 and I will be very interested to see what they have to say. Until then, Matt, I think that's going to do it for us. I appreciate you taking the time to go through all these earnings reports and give us your thoughts today. Frankel: Well to talk about some of the smaller banks that are set to report this coming week like Ameris and some of the others. They're always fun to watch because they have different dynamics than the big banks in terms of regulation and stuff like that. Moser: Absolutely. Look forward to it. As always folks, you can reach out to us on Twitter at MF Industry Focus, or you can drop us an email at industryfocus@fool.com. As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Thanks as always, to Tim Sparks for putting the show together for us. For Matt Frankel, I'm Jason Moser. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.",

    "full_description": "The family drama surrounding Rogers Communications Inc. could have ripple effects for the company and its shareholders if it’s not resolved soon. The warning from experts comes as the Canadian telecommunications giant continues to make headlines over a feud involving ousted company chair Edward Rogers, his family and executives. Read more: Ousted Rogers board chair Edward Rogers re-elected as chair in ‘illegitimate’ meeting Rogers, which provides communications services to millions of Canadians, could be defined by this tussle if it continues into the future, experts tell Global News. Here’s what’s happening. Edward Rogers vs. Joe Natale View image in full screen Rogers President and CEO Joe Natale, right, and Chair of the Board Edward Rogers attend the company’s AGM in Toronto on Thursday, April 18, 2019. Chris Young/The Canadian Press Rogers started making headlines last week after media reports emerged Edward Rogers, son of late company founder Ted Rogers, wanted to remove CEO Joe Natale and reshuffle corporate leadership. Story continues below advertisement Multiple reports said the plan was blocked by other board members, including Edward Rogers’ sisters and mother, and his attempt led to him being replaced as corporate chairman. However, Edward Rogers wasn’t going to go away quietly. As chair of the Rogers Control Trust , the controlling shareholder of the company, he holds 97.5 per cent of the voting power and said he would replace five corporate board directors with his own appointees. The company said it was invalid, but Edward Rogers held a meeting on Sunday in British Columbia with his five board members and subsequently said he was elected chair of a new corporate board. He plans to take his case to the British Columbia Supreme Court to confirm it. Read more: Rogers CFO Tony Staffieri leaves company with no reason given Richard Leblanc, professor of governance, law and ethics at York University, told Global News that Rogers is at a crossroads. “It’s distracting. It’s diminishing the brand, the reputation of the company and of the individuals,” he said. “Shareholders are paying attention, customers are paying attention, individuals are paying attention. … What people might remember in the next 10 or 15 years is not the incredible success of the founder, Mr. Ted Rogers, but the dispute that is occurring.” Story continues below advertisement What impact could this have on the company? After Sunday’s meeting in British Columbia, the company finds itself with two corporate boards of directors, and each one is calling the other illegitimate. Edward Rogers’ mother, his siblings and several other board members said the B.C. meeting was unauthorized, and that the five members Edward sought to remove, remain on the board. Read more: Rogers rejects potential meeting between ousted chair and his preferred board appointees This power struggle is no doubt having ripple effects throughout the company, said Richard Powers, national academic director of the directors’ education program at the Rotman School of Management. “People are choosing sides in the management team. … This is such a distraction to management when their focus really should be Shaw and continuing to run the daily operations of the business,” he said. Story continues below advertisement “The longer it goes on, the more difficult it becomes.” 4:14 What the Rogers-Shaw deal means for your phone bill What the Rogers-Shaw deal means for your phone bill – Mar 18, 2021 Rogers is in the midst of purchasing smaller rival Shaw Communications for $26 billion, but several analysts told Reuters that the family drama is unlikely to damage the takeover bid. Yet other analysts said it could raise regulatory and financial risk around the deal. “Collateral damage now seems inevitable, and in our view will only grow the longer a definitive resolution takes,” said RBC Dominion Securities Inc. analyst Drew McReynolds and associate Riley Gray, in a Monday note to investors. Brad Shaw, Shaw’s executive chairman and CEO, has reaffirmed his commitment to the takeover, but his company’s stock has fallen in recent days as the battle continues. Story continues below advertisement What could this mean for shareholders? According to McReynolds and Gray, not only could the feud lead to an underperforming executive leadership team, but it could also affect investor confidence around governance and management. Another factor to watch is the share price of Rogers, Leblanc said. Rogers’ stock closed at $60.02 on Friday, and was trading lower on Monday after the battle intensified over the weekend. “The number one job of the board is to hire and fire the CEO, so it’s incumbent on the board to always look at performance, and always look at the job that they’re doing,” he said. “So shareholders should pay attention to this because the impact of what happens can affect the share price, and many Canadians are not only shareholders of Rogers, they’re also customers of Rogers.” Read more: Edward Rogers replaced as Rogers Communications chair amid executive power struggle Story continues below advertisement Recently, Rogers reported a profit of $490 million, down from $512 million in the same quarter last year, as its revenue held steady for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The cable TV and wireless company said the profit amounted to 97 cents per basic share, down from $1.01 per basic share a year ago. What happens now? With Edward Rogers planning to go to the B.C. Supreme Court to affirm his new corporate board, both Powers and Leblanc feel the feud could play out in the legal setting next. But both experts suggest a settlement should be reached to end the saga sooner rather than later. “The warring parties need to be brought into a room and a compromise needs to be reached,” Leblanc said. “Settle means some agreement, and it could be instead of replacing five directors, replacing two directors, reinstating Mr. Rogers as chair of the company board, and also an agreement of when the current CEO will step down. In my mind, that’s the type of a compromise that could occur to have a stand-down.” Story continues below advertisement Right now, all parties involved seem dug in. “I see Ed has appointed himself the Chairman. LOL,” Edward’s sister, Martha Rogers, tweeted on Sunday. “This should be taken as seriously as if he appointed himself the King of England.” I see Ed has appointed himself the Chairman. LOL. This should be taken as seriously as if he appointed himself the King of England. #OldGuardDown — Martha Rogers (@MarthaLRogers) October 25, 2021 — with files from The Canadian Press and Reuters © 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",

Community Bank System, inc ( NYSE:CBU ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 11:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good day and welcome to the Community Bank System Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the provisions of the Private Security Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry, markets and economic environment in which the company operates. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in these statements. These risks are detailed in the company's Annual Report in Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call presenters are Mark Tryniski, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joseph Sutaris, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will be joined by Joseph Serbun, Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer for the question-and-answer session. Gentlemen, you may begin. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Chad. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter conference call. We hope everyone is well. I think earnings for the quarter were right in line with our expectations and impacted by the same influences the past several quarters. Margin continues to be a headwind, but deposit fees, the strength of our financial services businesses, and credit tailwinds and we saw that this quarter. The bigger story for us in the quarter was loan growth. We had growth in every one of our portfolios this quarter ex-PPP and our pipelines and market activity continue to be very strong. We're encouraged by these trends and have really good momentum right now across all of our credit businesses. We also increased our securities book in the quarter given the market opportunity and that will be additive to future earnings as well. I think Joe will provide more detail on that. The recent strength of our financial services businesses continued in the quarter with revenues up 17% and pre-tax earnings up 22% over 2020. We also closed on the acquisition of Fringe Benefits Design of Minnesota, a provider of retirement plan administration and consulting services with offices in Minneapolis and South Dakota. Their performance out of the gate has been exceptional. So we expect that will be a productive addition to our benefits business. Our benefits wealth and insurance businesses are all performing extremely well right now in what is a very productive growth, pricing, and M&A environment for those businesses. On the human capital front, as we previously announced, I'm delighted that Maureen Gillan-Myer has joined us as Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. She previously held the same role for HSBC USA and will bring tremendous experience, expertise, and business judgment to Community Bank System and we look forward to her contributions to our continuing human capital efforts. Lastly, earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire a Elmira Savings Bank, a $650 million asset bank with 12 offices across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York State. It's a very nice franchise with a very good mortgage business that we expect will be $0.15 per share accretive on a full year basis excluding acquisition expenses. So a very productive low risk transaction. We have targeted a closing date in Q1 of next year. Looking ahead, we like our current momentum across the company in all of our businesses. Joe? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. As Mark noted, the third quarter earnings results were solid with fully diluted GAAP and operating earnings per share of $0.83. The GAAP earnings results were $0.04 per share or 5.1% higher than the third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings results, but $0.02 per share or 2.4% below the prior year's third quarter on an operating basis. The decrease in operating earnings per share is driven by decrease in net interest income and higher operating expenses as well as increases in income taxes and fully diluted shares outstanding, offset in part by lower credit-related costs and an increase in non-interest revenues, particularly in the company's non-banking financial services businesses. Comparatively, the company recorded fully diluted GAAP in operating earnings per share of $0.88 in the linked second quarter of 2021. The company recorded total revenues of $156.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $4.3 million or 2.8% over the prior year's third quarter. The increase in total revenues between the periods was driven by a $6.9 million or 16.9% increase in financial services revenues, offset in part by a $2.2 million decrease in banking-related non-interest revenues and a $0.4 million or 0.4% decrease in net interest income. Total revenues were up $5.4 million or 3.5% from the second quarter 2021 results driven by a $0.5 million or 0.5% increase in net interest income, a $1.4 million increase in banking-related non-interest revenues, and a $3.5 million or 8% increase in financial services revenues. Total non-interest revenues accounted for 41% of the company's total revenues in the third quarter. Although net interest income was down only slightly from the same quarter last year, the results were achieved in a significantly lower net interest margin outcome. The company's tax equivalent net interest margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 2.74% as compared to 3.12% one year prior, a 38 basis point decrease between the periods. Comparatively, the company's tax equivalent net interest margin for the second quarter 2021 was 2.79% or 5 basis points higher than the third quarter. Net interest margin results continue to be negatively impacted by the low interest rate environment and the abundance of low yield cash equivalents being maintained on the company's balance sheet. The tax equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.83% in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 2.89% in the linked second quarter and 3.28% one year prior. During the third quarter, the company recognized $4.3 million of PPP-related interest income including $3.7 million of net deferred loan fees. This compares to $3 million of PPP-related interest income recognized in the same quarter last year and $3.9 million in the linked second quarter of 2021. On a year-to-date basis, the company has recognized $15.1 million of PPP-related net interest income. The company's total cost of deposits remained low however, averaging 9 basis points during the third quarter of 2021. Employee benefit services revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $29.9 million, $4.8 million or 18.9% higher than the third quarter of 2020. The improvement in revenues was driven by increases in employee benefit trust and custodial fees as well as incremental revenues from the acquisition of Fringe Benefits Design of Minnesota during the quarter. Wealth management revenues for the third quarter 2021 were$8.3 million, up from $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2020. The $1.4 million or 20.8% increase in wealth management revenues was primarily driven by increases in investment management and trust services revenues. Insurance services revenues of $9.2 million were up $0.6 million or 7.6% over the prior year's third quarter driven by organic growth factors and the third quarter, acquisition of a Boston-based specialty lines insurance practice. Banking non-interest revenues decreased $2.2 million or 11.5% from $19.1 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $16.9 million in the third quarter of 2021. This was driven by a $3.5 million decrease in mortgage banking income offset in part by $1.3 million or 8.3% increase in deposit service and other banking fees. On a linked quarter basis, financial services revenues were up $3.5 million or 8%, reflective of the organic and acquisition-related momentum in these businesses and banking non-interest revenues were up $1.4 million or 8.7% [Phonetic]. During the third quarter of 2021, the company recorded a net benefit in the provision for credit losses of $0.9 million. This compares to a $1.9 million provision for credit losses recorded in the prior year third quarter. The company's net loan charge-offs were only 7 basis points annualized in both periods. During the third quarter of 2021, economic forecasts were more favorable than the third quarter 2020 economic forecast driven by the post-vaccine economic recovery, which in combination with elevated real estate and vehicle loan collateral values drove down the expected life of loan losses. On a September 2021 year-to-date basis, the company recorded net charge-offs of $1.1 million or 2 basis points annualized. The company recorded $100.4 million in total operating expenses in the third quarter 2021 as compared to $97 million of total operating expenses in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $3.4 million or 3.6% between the periods. Operating expenses exclusive of litigation and acquisition-related expenses increased $7.2 million or 7.7% between the comparable quarters, $5.6 million of which was driven by an increase in salaries and employee benefits due to acquisition-related staffing increases, merit and incentive-related employee wage increases, higher payroll taxes, and higher employee benefit-related expenses. Other expenses were up $0.9 million or 8.7% due to the general increase in the level of business activities. Data processing and communication expenses were also up $0.9 million or 7.2% due to the company's implementation of new customer-facing digital technologies and back office systems between the comparable periods. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased slightly due primarily to branch consolidation activities between the periods. In comparison, the company recorded $93.5 million of total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 21.1% up from 20.3% in the third quarter 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in certain state income taxes that were enacted in the second quarter of 2021. The balance sheet crested the $15 billion total asset threshold during the third quarter due to the continued inflows of deposits, which increased $384.8 million or 3.1% from the end of the second quarter. The company's low yielding cash and cash equivalents remained elevated totaling $2.32 billion at the end of the quarter despite the company purchasing $536.9 million of investment securities during the quarter. Ending loans at September 30, 2021 were $7.28 billion, $38.4 million or 0.5% higher than the second quarter 2021 ending loans of $7.24 billion and $176.1 million or 2.4% lower than one year prior. Excluding PPP activity, ending loans increased $154.1 million or 2.2% in the third quarter. This increase was driven by growth in all five loan portfolio segments: consumer mortgages, consumer indirect loans, consumer direct loans, home equity, and business lending excluding PPP. As of September 30th, 2021, the company's business lending portfolio included 1,386 PPP loans with a total balance of $165.4 million. This compares to 2,571 PPP loans with a total balance of $284.8 million at June 30th, 2021. The company expects to recognize its remaining net deferred PPP fees totaling $6.3 million over the next few quarters. The company's capital ratios remained strong in the second quarter. The company's net tangible equity [Phonetic] to net tangible assets ratio was 8.59% at September 30th, 2021. This was down from 9.92% a year earlier and 9.02% at the end of the second quarter. The company's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.22% at September 30th, 2021, which is nearly 2 times the well capitalized regulatory standard of 5%. The company has an abundance of liquidity. The combination of the company's cash and cash equivalents, borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve Bank, borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank and unpledged available for sale investment securities portfolio provided the company with over $6.18 billion of immediately available sources of liquidity at the end of the third quarter. At September 30th, 2021, the company's allowance for credit losses totaled $49.5 million or 0.68% of total loans outstanding. This compares to $51.8 million or 0.71% of total loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and $65 million or 0.87% of total loans outstanding at September 30th, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses is reflective of an improving economic outlook, very low levels of net charge-offs, and a decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans. Non-performing loans decreased in the third quarter to $67.8 million or 0.93% of loans outstanding, down from $70.2 million was 0.97% of loans outstanding at the end of the linked second quarter of 2021, but up from $32.2 million or 0.43% of loans at the end of the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to the reclassification of certain hotel loans under extended forbearance from accrual to non-accrual status between the periods. Loans 30 to 89 days delinquent totaled 0.35% of loans outstanding at September 30th, 2021. This compares to 0.36% one year prior and 0.25% at the end of the linked second quarter. Management believes the low levels of delinquent loans and charge-offs has been supported by extraordinary federal and state government financial assistance provided to consumers throughout the pandemic. During the third quarter of 2021, the company increased its quarterly cash dividend a $0.01 or 2.4% to $0.43 per share on its common stock. This increase marked the company's 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. Looking forward, we remain focused on new loans generation and will continue to monitor market conditions to seek the right opportunities to deploy our excess liquidity. Our loan pipelines are robust and asset quality remains very strong. We also expect net interest margin pressures to persist to remain well below our pre-pandemic levels but also believe our abundance of cash equivalents represents a significant future earnings opportunity. We're also fortunate and pleased to have strong non-banking businesses that have supported and diversified our streams of non-interest revenue. And lastly, to echo Mark's comments, we are pleased and excited to be partnering with Elmira Savings Bank. Elmira has been serving its communities for 150 years and will enhance our presence in five counties in New York's Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions. At June 30th, 2021, Elmira had total assets of $648.7 million, total deposits of $551.2 million and net loans of $465.3 million. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions including approval by the shareholders of Elmira Savings Bank and required regulatory approvals. Thank you. I'll now turn it back to Chad to open the line for questions. Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] And the first question today will be from Alex Twerdahl with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hey, good morning guys. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Alex. Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Alex. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst First off, just wanted to talk about loan growth for a little bit. I think historically you guys have been kind of on an organic basis to low-single digit loan grower on an annual basis. Based on what you did this quarter and some of the commentary on the pipelines and sort of your outlook, do you think that maybe something has shifted and that loan growth on an organic basis can be higher than the sort of low-single digit rate that has been the historical trend? Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Alex, good question. I'll make a couple of comments and then ask Joe Serbun to comment a little bit further, but I think you're right. Historically, low-single digits. I don't know if we consistently achieve that to be fair. I think also our markets -- they are low growth markets. I think we executed reasonably well in those markets given the growth opportunities, but I think we've also -- we have an opportunity to execute better organically in terms of our loan businesses and so we're starting to focus on that a little bit. We've always -- we've done a lot of M&A and I think that's been additive. I think without having done the M&A as kind of an opportunity for us to create shareholder value, we would have difficulty in our markets. So I think that's been a tremendous strategy, but I just think we -- I think we've executed well. I think on the organic side, we can do a bit better. It is pretty meaningful. I mean if we can move the needle even a little bit organically, that will make a fairly significant difference in terms of earnings potential. So we put a little bit more effort into that in terms of structure and resources, quality of resources, support process, systems and just I think a greater focus on doing a bit better in optimizing our organic opportunities and our markets and I think we're starting to see that. So I guess with that as a backdrop, Joe, you can comment a little bit further maybe on the different workflows and what we're doing there. Joseph F. Serbun -- Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer Sure, Alex. Good morning. So a couple of comments. First, if you look at our marketplaces, over the last couple of years, we've expanded into some bigger geographies, which provides us greater opportunities and I think that by having the right folks in leadership positions in those markets has made a significant difference for us. So we've been able to grow in some of the larger markets organically, which is good. On the smaller end, we're looking to take advantage of some technology to allow us to spend more time outsourcing the next opportunities and grow the business and so on that small end of that spectrum, we'll utilize technology to expedite processing and approvals and again hope to grow organically on the small business side. The pipeline, as Joe mentioned, it's almost tripled from the beginning of the year and that's just an increased focus, increased calling efforts that the marketplace has given us. So it's nothing new, its dedicated, it's concentrated, its regimented. We got the right folks in the right management positions for us to execute and for us to continue to -- or to exceed some of the lighter loan growth that we've experienced organically over the past couple of years. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer The only thing I would add to that, Alex, is this is not about credit risk or credit quality. That is not going to change and we made that very clear upfront that we just want to execute better in terms of our sales cycle, let's call it in our markets across our different portfolios. We are not -- anything that -- any improvement that we achieve will not be at the expense of credit quality. Joseph F. Serbun -- Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer Alex, do more of the same. That's the theme, do more of the same. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Great, that's helpful commentary. Just the comment on the pipelines having tripled since beginning of the year. Is that overall pipelines or just the commercial pipelines? Joseph F. Serbun -- Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer So that's the commercial pipeline. The mortgage pipeline is hung in there -- residential mortgage pipeline is hung in there nicely for us too and it continues to be strong. I will tell you that our application volume on the resi mortgage side through September surpasses all of the application volume we did for the full year last year. So that bodes well for us as we're heading into the fourth quarter. So it's a strong pipeline and it should carry us through the end of the year. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Great and the plan is to continue to put residential on balance sheet versus selling it into the secondary market? Joseph F. Serbun -- Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer Correct. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Great and then, the other thing that jumped out to me this quarter is the salary and benefits line which came in I think you alluded to it in the prepared remarks, Joe, about where it came in versus last quarter. Can you just talk about how much of that might be related to the acquisitions you did during the quarter, how much of that might be non-recurring run rate I guess would be the best way to put it and so what the expectation should be for the fourth quarter prior to layering on Elmira next year? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's a very good question, Alex. So just to provide some backdrop and some color. Prior to the pandemic, we were kind of calling a run rate that was somewhere around $95 million to $96 million on a quarterly basis. That's just in average run rate and then the pandemic hit and we had some decreases in expenses for various reasons, less travel, just a lot of the business activities were down across the board across all of our businesses. So our operating expenses came in very low last year during the pandemic. They were down in the $93 million to $94 million range. So sort of level setting back to, call it the post or the pre-pandemic levels run rate is was about $96 million, $95 million somewhere in that general range. We added -- we had two acquisitions during the quarter that added a couple of million dollars of total opex including amortization components of those transactions, but all in added about $2 million to the total -- a couple of million dollars to the opex. We had a couple of one -- call them, probably likely non-recurring items totaling maybe $1 million in the quarter. So expectations on a going forward basis, really I would kind of take a look at this quarter's number and back off maybe $1 million somewhere in that range. When we hit the first quarter -- for most of the first quarter, we do incur higher payroll taxes. So we usually get a little bump there from an opex standpoint and then if we are successful in closing Elmira late in the first quarter, obviously, it will change from that point going forward. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Okay, so the salaries and benefits line that is more the $62.9 million that is a pretty decent run rate going into next quarter? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I think that's a decent run rate going into next quarter. There are a couple of items in there that were a little higher than our expectations. I'm not sure if those will sell down a bit in the fourth quarter, but conservatively, I would probably use what we incurred in the third quarter for the fourth quarter run rate. Alex Twerdahl -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thanks for taking my questions. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Alex. Operator The next question will be from Erik Zwick with Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead. Erik Zwick -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst Good morning, guys. Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Erik. Erik Zwick -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst In the prepared remarks, you mentioned some plans to make some investments in 4Q in the securities portfolio. Curious if you could provide any color there in terms of the magnitude as well as kind of expectations for yield and duration of what you're looking to add? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'll take that Erik. So at the end of the third quarter, we saw some opportunities in the securities markets and we purchased some kind of in the belly of the curve, five and seven-year type paper. We came in on a blended basis at about a 120 [Phonetic] on $536 million of activity, most of which hit really at the end of the quarter. So we really didn't realize the interest income benefit of those purchases during the quarter, but we were active as rates kind of get back into the range that we are hopeful for. If you recall, we were on the sidelines at the end of the second quarter. Actually since we closed the quarter, we've been active with another couple of hundred million dollars. Rates are up a little bit. So we continue to be active. We'll see what the rest of the quarter holds for us, but the continued inflow of deposits is providing us continued upside from a net interest income standpoint, not necessarily a total great margin outcome, certainly not back to pre-pandemic levels, but I would expect that we'll continue to be active in the market throughout the fourth quarter and to the tune of a couple of hundred million dollars. Erik Zwick -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst Thanks and I hear you on the net interest income potentially growing larger as the balance sheet does and just thinking about the profitability aspect and the net interest margin, if you're going to put more securities to work here, it sounds like the loan pipeline is really strong for at least another quarter or so. Do you see a point where that the core net interest margin can bottom and start to increase again or what are your expectations for when that might occur? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Erik, that's a very good question and I want to just qualify that comment. The PPP income through the first three quarters was about $15 million. So some of the securities activities that we're taking on in the third quarter -- took on in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter are effectively a replacement, if you will, of some of that PPP income. So the net interest income levels will be hopefully comparable in that regard. However, on the loan side, our yield on the loan portfolio was about a 4.15% [Phonetic] for 4.16% [Phonetic] I believe for the quarter. If you back out PPP, it's kind of around the 3.90% [Phonetic] something. It's kind of -- it's down a little bit. Our new volumes going on are a little under 3.5% [Phonetic]. So the challenge from a loan perspective is having the volume increases outpace the lower yield. It's just what the market is giving us right now. So really that becomes the challenge as we move ahead. So hopefully between the size of the pipeline and the growth and even though it's going on a little lower rate, we can keep our head above water on the loan interest income side. On the cost of fund side, I mean we're about as low as we're going to go, maybe there's another basis point in there, but 9 basis points, it's difficult to really do much on the funding side at this point. Erik Zwick -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst That's helpful, thanks. And then just thinking about the loan loss provision and the reserves today, you referenced the improving outlook for the economy as well as better collateral values for real estate and automobiles and such. And then I guess the PPP continues to run off for a couple of more quarters. If you start to get to the point where you're seeing some net loan growth, should we start to see positive provisioning again at this point? Are you happy with I guess as a model kind of where it has the reserves today, how to think about those puts and takes? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So there is a couple of moving parts in there, Erik. So yeah, I would expect with loan growth, typically you would -- we need to reserve more dollars and therefore go to the positive side of the provision. The economic outlook is a variable that can change and can impact that reserve level. So that remains to be seen. The other thing too is that we now have a charge-off history. Part of the basis to the model is kind of the quantitative components of the model and the charge-off history is just, it's lower. We haven't had significant charge-offs in the last 12 months and so that also impacts the quantitative side. So there is also -- we have to bake that into the model. If you look at kind of our last 12 months of charge-offs, you look at our reserve right now. it's about 19 times last 12 months, but I don't believe that necessarily the last 12 months are indicative of the future, but nonetheless, the reserves relative to historical charge-offs is pretty high at this point, but I think a fair expectation is that provisioning would probably be closer to charge-off levels and probably there will be positive provisioning would be my best guess at this point because it's hard to really improve much on the economic outlook. Erik Zwick -- Boenning & Scattergood -- Analyst Thanks for taking my questions today. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Erik. Operator The next question will be from Russell Gunther with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Russell Gunther -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst Hey, good morning, guys. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Russell. Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Russell. Russell Gunther -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst I just want to spend a minute on the fee income outlook if we could, you know, continue to have really strong organic revenue growth in the differentiated verticals. Could you share with us your expectations for revenue outlook within employee benefits and insurance and wealth on an organic basis going forward and then what you might expect to be able to supplement with continued acquisitions? Thank you. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer It's Mark, Russell. I think those businesses have really since COVID, have really performed well. The environment is good for those businesses in terms of growth opportunities and potential. The pricing in those markets is pretty good. Some of them are equity and market dependent which that's been additive as well because the markets continue to be strong. So all of the benefits, wealth and insurance have all performed extremely well for a number of course probably the last couple of years they've been really strong, but as of late over the past four quarters have been tremendously strong and they continue to grow. I mean, interestingly enough, they have also grown their revenues faster than their expenses. So the margins are actually growing as well. So I don't see anything on the horizon that could derail that necessarily into the future. So I think on the non-bank side, hopefully, those conditions won't [Phonetic] continue to exist. There's a fair bit of M&A activity in the benefit space as well which we participated in. We continue to have those opportunities as well and we think that might continue at least into the foreseeable future there. On the non-bank side, it's been or on the bank side, excuse me, we got hammered during COVID like everyone else, but that's really kind of started to come back and continue to trend upward. The interchange in debit revenues continue to be very strong. Overdraft is not where it was, but it's coming back and there may be potential regulatory pressure on that revenue stream as well, which we have conversations about. So right now I think it's hard to predict. It's hard to put a number on it. We're up on the non-bank side as I said 17% this quarter over last year. Pre-tax earnings we're up 22%. So we're actually improving [Phonetic] margin as well as we gain revenues in those businesses. So the future continues to look good into the foreseeable future, but you can't predict. So I think to kind of handicap it with a number I think is very, very difficult to do. The wealth business this year has had tremendous growth in revenues and earnings. The benefits business, tremendous growth in revenue and earnings. The insurance business is up a little bit less. The margin is also up a fair bit. So really strong execution on all three of those businesses in the quarter and we expect that into the foreseeable future. Russell Gunther -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst I appreciate it. Mark. Thank you. That's it for me, guys. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Russell. Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Russell. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question will be from Matthew Breese with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Matt. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst Maybe going back to loan growth, so the two areas that you showed the most growth this quarter was mortgage and indirect and as I think about those segments, both have their distinct macro headwinds. So, mortgage is going to be dealing with higher rates and indirect with inventory and chip shortages. So I hear you on the pipeline, but I wanted to get your thoughts on those items specifically as headwinds and the sustainability and durability of the pipeline and how long before do you think loan growth kind of reverts to historical averages? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Hey, Matthew, it's Joe. I'll take that. So, excuse me, so on the indirect side, you hit it right on the head when you spoke about the chip shortages and supplies and the impact on opportunity. We expect to go through the fourth quarter maybe slipping a little bit -- going back a little bit, still growing, but not to the same magnitude as we have in the other -- in the prior three quarters and then certainly as you're heading into Q1 and beyond, I guess it's going to be a little bit difficult to handicap where we think the chip shortages or the supply shortages are going to impact us, but clearly something that we need to keep our eye on and focus on. On the resi mortgage side, I think it's going to slow down for us a little bit, but with the increased focus of model strategy and dedication of people, I think that we'll be able to continue to grow the resi mortgage business through 2022. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would just add, the thing I've seen in the mortgage business in our markets, it's not as volatile as it is in some of the bigger markets where the markets really ramp up and cool down quickly and our markets don't do that, they are more stable. So we should be able to generally achieve kind of to the 4% run rate and growth in that business in our markets. I'll be honest, I'm shocked that the car business is up as much as it is considering there is no inventory, I mean it's surprising but it's good. We've got -- some of the competitors kind of got out of that market as rates came down and then you had kind of the impact of the recession in all of that. So there was kind of disruption in that market as well and we've been in that business for a long time and we stay in it, we don't get in, we don't get out. We have good relationships in our dealer network. So I'm not surprised that our growth was better than maybe the market, but I'm surprised on an absolute basis that it's where it's at. If you had told me in the third quarter of last year that we'd be up 12.5% in our business, I would not have believed it, but here's where we're at. So I think that will probably slow down a little bit as well. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst Got it, OK. And then turning back to the employee benefit services businesses, obviously, revenues were up nicely this quarter. How much of that increase was due to recent acquisitions, how much of it was due to just the business growing organically. And then you also mentioned additional acquisitions in the space. So where should we expect quarterly employee benefit services revenues to settle out before it starts to just grow on its own and on an organic basis? Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think the vast majority of the growth in the quarter was organic, not acquired. That FBD acquisition, it was not that big. It came on during the quarter. So the success of those businesses over the last four quarters and beyond frankly is -- it's a multi-year kind of building growth process for those business, but it's mostly all organic. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst Okay and then just staying on this topic. I mean, oftentimes with these fee income businesses, great for fees, great for ROA but what gets lost in the fold are the associated expenses. You mentioned margins are higher. Could you just give us some sense for the efficiency or what the profit margin on the employee benefit services business is? Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer We generally have not kind of disclosed that separately. I would tell you though that it's over 35%. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst On the margin? Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst Got it, OK. And then the last one from me. Joe, we talked a little bit about the outlook for the NIM. I was just curious if we continue to see some securities purchases and some decent loan growth, do you have any idea on the outlook for core NII. I mean it's been growing at kind of a low-to-mid single digit clip. Do you think that's sustainable through the acquisition of Elmira? Joseph E. Sutaris -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Matt, I think it's sustainable, because of the security purchases that have replaced some of the PPP recognition. There's still $6.3 million of PPP net deferred fees as well. I know you asked about core, but some of that will be recognized between now and the Elmira transaction as well, but from a -- on a core basis, I think we can kind of keep our head just about level, just slightly above water because of the securities purchases. So I think that will be the likely outcome until we get Elmira. Matthew Breese -- Stephens Inc -- Analyst Great, I appreciate it. That's all I had. Thank you. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Tryniski for any closing remarks. Mark E. Tryniski -- President and Chief Executive Officer That is it for us here in Syracuse.

Kimberly Clark Corporation ( NYSE:KMB ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 10:00 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding. We now have your presenters in conference. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce today's first presenter, Taryn Miller. Taryn Miller -- Vice President, Finance and Interim Head of Investor Relations Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Kimberly Clark's third quarter earnings conference call. On the call with me today are, Mike Hsu, our Chairman and CEO; and Maria Henry, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings news release and we also published prepared management remarks from Mike and Maria that summarized our third quarter results and full year 2021 outlook. Both documents are available in the Investors section of our website. We hope you find it valuable to have our prepared remarks ahead of this call. In just a moment, Mike will share a few opening comments and then we'll take your questions. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements. Please see the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We may also refer to adjusted results and outlook both excludes certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Okay, thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. Organic sales were strong of 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America Personal Care organic sales were, up 11%, driven by mid single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume. In D&E markets personal care, organic sales were up 7% organic sales increased double digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa. Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin American and KC Professional. Our market positions remain strong and are improving reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remain solid with good sequential gains in personal care, our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continue to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets including China and Brazil. We also continue to focus on cost with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between the line spending. Now, clearly our margins and earnings were disappointing, as higher inflation and supply chain disruptions increased our costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter. I'd like to highlight the effect of three areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. First, as we noted in July and on the basis of external forecast we had expected, commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021 instead prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate. Second, a tight US labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand. Third, energy cost were up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6 times year-ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent. As a result, our margins are down -- but we're down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken to-date. We're not pleased with our results and we're taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals, and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we faced this year will be behind us. This includes the US winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we faced this year may become more persistent, we're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities, we're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers. In addition, the going forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable. We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions. We will also continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working and we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. Now we'd like to address your questions. Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hey guys, how are you? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good, it's been better. Dara Mohsenian -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yes, yes. Yes, tough environment. So you mentioned further pricing actions Mike, could you just be a little more specific there maybe review what you've done globally in terms of percent of portfolio, magnitude of increases generally where you've taken increases. And maybe just some insight in terms of the forward pricing? Are you looking at it more on a product category basis, geographic basis. But just as you think about the forward pricing any more insight would be helpful. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, OK. Still in talk with our -- maybe I'll start a little bit philosophically. And I would say, based on our strategy improving margins as a core aspect of KC 2022 for us. And so we've taken further actions to offset inflation. I mean, and I believe margin improvement is a fundamental pillar of what we need to do for the company. And so we expect to fully offset inflation with both pricing and cost reduction, so a combination. And while we took the fully offset that over time. So we announced some further actions in Q3. The year-to-date our actions are fairly broad reaching, every region, every business generally. I wouldn't actually not every single business, but generally across most markets. And so in Q3, we've announced broader actions in North America, professional and consumer Latin America and other market selectively. So I would say pretty far-reaching. I will tell you Dara, our earlier pricing actions are generally on track as you saw, kind of, in the release, we had 3 points of price factor in organic in the quarter, we have seen some other brands move particularly in North America, haven't seen significant movement in private label yet. Although, I'll note that, that typically occurs a little bit later. And we've had a little share softness. But in general, I think our volumes are holding up well. Dara Mohsenian -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Okay. And on the advertising side, certainly you've cut back a bit in this tire commodity environment. Is there a point when you get concerned, then maybe you've cut back a bit too much. Obviously, you mentioned the market share results remain healthy. But how do you sort of think about flexing that line item, then were share of voices today in the categories you're competing in? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, I mean -- I think you could probably see it in the release. I mean, we feel very good about our organic performance, I think our brands are very fundamentally healthy and I think our investment in both innovation and commercial programing especially advertising are working very hard for us. So we're going to obviously work hard to make sure our margins improve. But we want to maintain that investment in the brands, especially where it's working. That said, we have made some adjustments in some categories where it felt like it was perhaps a little less effective in the current environment and so to that extent we've done that. We have trends are between the line spend a little bit, but that -- I would tell you that's been more on the G&A front and on the A&CP front in the quarter. So [Technical Issues] if there's something to point out. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, I think, I describe it as we're being very pragmatic here, we had some challenges on our supply chain side that are affecting us. And so we have challenges getting the product to our customers and where we've got higher demand than we can for sale at the moment, because of the supply chain challenges. We're really looking at what are the near-term returns on our investments. And we've been prioritizing those as we look at the current situation. And so we've trimmed the advertising investment a bit, but that's on the back of significant step-ups over the last two years. And when I look at the year, our expectation is that on a dollar basis we'll be up nicely from where we were in 2019. Dara Mohsenian -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Okay, and then last question, just as we look out, obviously there is a lot of volatility from a commodity cost standpoint and things have been moving in own direction and you're taking a lot of pricing to help offset that. Is there a certain point, you can look out to where you think the year-over-year pricing, at least based on the plans that are in place today, as well as spot commodities where we are today, where you are able to fully offset it on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, there is still, you know, there is a big gap leaving this year, but I'm wondering on sort of more a go-forward basis. Is it more in the middle of next year when you think you have enough pricing to offset year-over-year commodity increases? Could it be earlier than that? How do you sort of think through that conceptually understanding there'll be some gap leaving this year, but when on a year-over-year basis that we sort of get to an ability maybe to offset some of these cost pressures from your vantage point? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Dara, I mean, that's why we've been saying we'll offset or get our margins back in line and improving over time with both pricing and cost reduction. I think the middle of next year is probably a good, kind of, perspective for us, because obviously what happened this year was, you know, we won -- we saw the change in the commodity line, obviously coming out of the first quarter. And so we announced pricing that was effective or we announced it at the end of the first quarter and it was effective in our second quarter of this year. Certainly coupon have moved significantly since then, and so we've made additional actions and that's going to take us time to implement fully, so that's one component. The other component, I will tell you that looking forward is, and I think we indicated this about 2-22 is that the global supply chain is under pressure and we do expect cost to remain elevated for a period, not all costs. Certainly, I think there are some fundamentals in the eucalyptus market that would say, hey, there is more capacity coming along, so that should come back a little bit. But the polymer-based products seem like they're going to remain elevated for a little while. We mentioned US labor costs and pressures on transportation globally. I think that's going to remain elevated for a while, because I don't see a fundamental catalyst to change that in the near-term. And so that's why we're making some barbells. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, I would add it. It will depend on the -- where commodities go and any pricing actions that we take from here. So I might be a little bit more cautious than the middle of next year in terms of margin recovery. But we'll have to see how the dynamics play out, I think at this point it's too early to call, what I would say is we understand the situation, we understand what the drivers are and we'll manage through it with an eye toward recovering on margins overtime. Dara Mohsenian -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst That's helpful. Thanks, I'll get back in queue. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Lauren. Lauren Lieberman -- Barclays -- Analyst Thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to just focus in a little bit on the supply chain disruption, you know, mentioned briefly in the prepared remarks and you guys just spoke to the bit. So -- and it's also impacting your sales outlook for this year. So was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what categories are we talking about? Is it you're not able to procure inputs? Or is it about not being able to get from your factory to the store effectively on which element of supply chain is under pressure and what categories, should we be looking for that pressure and particularly next quarter? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Okay, well, maybe I'll start and Maria has probably got much more detail. But I would just not to be flip one, but it is affecting almost, kind of, all areas of our operation. I mean, certainly, I think you can clearly see on fiber and resin base the commodity challenges and so I think that's, kind of, well established and visible for you all. I think maybe -- would maybe as a little less clear is, kind of, how it's rolling through and what I mentioned labor markets and the transportation markets it ripples through and my take would be, it looks like COVID appears to have increased the demand for goods over the past year or so and as shifting expanded a little bit from services to goods. And so with that, the other effect of COVID is -- and you've read all the articles about the great resignation, whether that's the case, or whether it's more that there are a lot more options for hourly work, it has really tightened the hourly labor supply and so because of that that pressure on both sides increased demands means much more demand for containers or trucking less labor means fewer drivers to drive the trucks and because of that, as you noted in our third -- even in our third quarter, while our service levels are improving significantly, we were not able to get all our orders out the door on the timeline that we want it. And because of that, that rolls through in multiple ways: one, is we pay higher rates for employees; higher wages -- we're paying higher rates for transportation, it's rolling through in some cases, our employee tenure is -- has shortened dramatically and so it's changing how we staff, because we have to staff more people to get the product out the door. We've got production outages, mis-deliveries and that ripples through with fines and everything else with customers, and so there's just too many ways that I think both this pressure on the labor side and the transportation markets, kind of, ripples through the cost, and that's kind of why you're seeing a little softness in our FORCE delivery. Most of that was because of the elevated cost. I don't know, Maria do you have more to add? Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. No, I think that was pretty, pretty thorough is basically across the board, getting supply into our mills, getting supply out of our mills, getting the products moved around the distribution network, lots of challenges on the warehouse side. We need to hire in a normal time if we have 30 people given the inefficiencies with the labor and turnover, we might need to have 40 people just to get the same amount of product out the door as an example. So if some -- across the board, primarily in North America although in the UK, there's also distribution challenges, it's another market where it impacted our sales in the quarter and that also has to do with labor-related to Brexit. So it's -- I've never seen a supply chain environment like this and it's affecting us across the P&L. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And, Lauren, one thing I'll add is, I don't know that there is a -- I think we said in the notes, not a short-term solution here, because it does feel like it's based on fundamentals, which is -- there is more demand for goods and I think we're seeing that many categories beyond consumer. And then there is -- it does feel like there's more options for hourly employment and because of that, that's putting pressure on the labor markets and hiring for the roles that we need, right? Lauren Lieberman -- Barclays -- Analyst Yes, OK. And so when you also mentioned about, I think it was in the prepared remarks that investing in the supply chain to meet demand. This is what we're talking, it's just absorbing these higher cost, it's not structural capex type investment, it's investment, meaning an incremental workers and so on? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Right. It's the P&L and that's been -- and then I think I've mentioned that before in terms of overall investment in capex and where those dollars, like going on part -- going to that part of the investment is in digital supply chain and that's been a driver of our capex and we'll continue to be for several years and when we -- even when we looked at things like the S4 HANA upgrade, we've ramped a lot of supply chain, digital capabilities into that program. But that's not new news. Lauren Lieberman -- Barclays -- Analyst Okay, great. I'll leave it there. So that was a lot that you gave me. So thanks very much. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Okay, thanks, Lauren. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Chris. Chris Carey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks so much. So a couple of category questions actually. On the Personal Care side, can you just maybe expand a bit on the strength that we're seeing in the business? There's been a lot of commentary around challenged birth rates and the business continues to see strong growth. I think North American [Indecipherable] volumes this quarter. Our forecast is wrong, you know, for the birth rates this year or certain income tax is doing better? Is stimulus offset the impact of the job losses. Just any perspective you might be able to provide around why that business seems to be doing better? And then just add on the second kind of category question here. I mean, I appreciate that the tissue business, the Consumer Tissue business is seeing difficult constant continued destocking, but there has been some losses. I wonder, if you could just expand upon that as well? So there is one on the Personal Care side and then on the tissue side as well, please. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So overall, Chris, our brand fundamentals are strong and really improving. And I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really this driver and I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen as far as long as I've been here. Obviously, not all of them are working the way that we would like to work. But in general, our brands are performing quite well. The birth rate issue you mentioned in diapers is real. Although there's a couple of dimensions of that, which is one, certainly a big decline in birth rate in China. Five years ago, there were about 17 million or 18 million births and this year it looks like they'll be about 10-ish, right somewhere in that range. And that said, it's still going to be a big market, right? And still the largest diaper market in the world for a long time. So that's one thing, that's one on the downside. The US on the contrast, because there was a little bit of declining versus last year that accelerated because of COVID, actually slightly up this year. And actually, we're seeing through the first couple of quarters and the projection is moving toward modest growth in the second half is -- so that's a bit of positive news. But the overall, I think, the reason why you're seeing strong performance on Personal Care is more what I talked about previously, which is strong innovation pipeline and strong, strong local programming on the commercial side. And with the teams, we'll say, it's not anyone thing, it's the combination of a plan meaning great innovation back with great marketing, great sales plan and local execution all working together. And I think, the numbers you may have seen, but Personal Care is accelerating globally. It was up 9.25% with a strong recovery in North America that was up 11%. And then we'll continue to see that strong performance across D&E in most markets. Making good progress in KC Professional is well, that was up 12% with North America being up 16%, and a healthy balance of both price and volume. And then consumer tissue although still down in the quarter was down 6% and down in North America, I'd say that was stabilizing. Our consumption in North America was better than our organic and that's because we are cycling a big year ago customer or consumer inventory built that happened in the third quarter. Little bit happened in the fourth quarter last year as well. So we're cycling that, but I'd say -- I would say, the good news on consumer tissue globally, it feels like it's stabilizing. We have given up a little share in North America, we probably picked up a little share last year on bath tissue, because we had a little more availability, our teams were scrambling to put out as much output if they could as we felt like there was a lot of consumer need for our products last year, and so we did that and we probably gave back a little share. But again, I think overall, we feel like consumer tissue certainly stabilizing versus what we saw in the first and second quarters. Chris Carey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst If I could just -- thanks for that. If I could just have one follow-up just on the pricing in Consumer Tissue, I was surprised to see it come in relatively low given the magnitude of the inflation that is historic as you mentioned number of times today. Is that just a function of timing? Was there a promotional event in the quarter that offset some of the pricing? Do you expect that to build significantly from here, just any perspective or is that a function of -- some of the market share issues you're seeing it? Maybe in our pricing as much as [Technical Issues] a, perspective, you might be able to just provide on the pricing in the consumer tissue business? And maybe how you see that shaping up in the very near-term. Thanks a lot. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, consumer tissue, particularly in North America we'll build as the year goes and into next year. And so, yes, so there was not that much in this year and then we did have a little additional trade investment versus a year ago. And so that offsets some of it, but we expect that to continue to build as the year goes. Chris Carey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Okay, thanks so much. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Okay. Thank you, Chris. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy -- Jefferies -- Analyst Great. Hey, good morning, Mike. Good morning, Maria. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning. Kevin Grundy -- Jefferies -- Analyst Mike, I wanted to come back just on market share, you touched on a moment ago and you didn't seem overly concerned about the US as we look at the Nielsen data, it's down across the board for the most part in the most recent four weeks and 12 weeks. And to your point, Mike, it has been more pronounced in Tissue Intel, but it's not entirely in Tissue Intel. So I just wanted to, kind of, get your opinion, your view on where you stand in the US, your relative satisfaction? How you believe your supply chain may or may not be more impacted or impacted to a greater degree by some of the supply chain issues out there? And how you're thinking about just broadly to a question earlier, just pulling back on spending in light of some of the market share trends, which I suspect, you're probably not where you hope they would be, but I can stop there and then I have a follow-up. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer No, no. Thank you for keeping us up for honest on the shares. But, you know, when I would say, we're improving from a tight supply situation and so that's probably the big thing. And so we're recovering really well. I think we have for the year up or even in four-way categories in North America, that's a little less than, kind of, what I would like. But seven of eight sequentially, so we're making progress. And so, if you remember Kevin, we had really tight supply situation toward the end of the first quarter and that flowed through the whole second quarter. We're down mid single-digit share points, I think in diapers at that point. So the team has really done a nice job recovering. I think in diapers, we were up 340 basis points sequentially in the quarter and just about even maybe a little bit less than even on share overall in the quarter. So we feel good about the recovery, I think we're making good progress in adult care. Tissue as I mentioned on the back tissue side, we're a little soft, because we had maybe a little elevated share that I was hoping to hold on to, but we haven't held on to it. But that was more due to availability. Kleenex is up pretty good, pretty substantially and we feel good about that all of the category is down. And then on towels, we're down about a little over a point. The issue there is we -- given supply conditions, we have shifted some of our supply of production from towels to bath and that's caused part of that. So overall, I would say that the brands are moving in the right direction not all, but we feel like we have the right plans in place and we're going to exchange to make progress. Kevin Grundy -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it, got it. Thanks, Mike. And then a quick follow-up for both of you, just on trade promotion. Mike, I think you made a comment that -- between the line spending was down, I believe that you said or maybe down sequentially, just clarify on that? It's not just Kimberly Clark, but broadly for CPG, they continued to -- promotion levels are moving higher and understandably moving higher off of lower bases in the prior year. But sort of triangulating that with the cost environment, what is sort of the logic between the CPG companies and retailers at this point to move trade promotion higher like is there a right level? Is the normalization we want to get back to pre-pandemic levels and sort of if so why, like what is the sense behind that, particularly in the current environment? And then I'll pass it on. Thank you. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Okay, Kevin maybe I'll comment on the trade and Maria, maybe comment on between the lines. But one, yes, in North America in particular, I think the promotion levels have moved back to \"typical levels\". The percent -- as measured by percent promo sold on -- or percent sold on promotion was down 50% to 75% last year, as we all curtailed promotions because of demand. At this point, I'd say it's returned to historical levels both in Personal Care, which happened about the third quarter of last year and then in consumer tissue, this quarter or the third quarter of this year. Yes, philosophically what I do think, retailers do believe brand switching occurs with brands and so promotions continue to be important in our categories. There is potentially some share shifting. Frankly, my emphasis would be on -- what I call the high road approach of growing brands, which is growing brands through great innovation and marketing and using trade and promotion as a fundamental element of that to support what we're doing from a marketing perspective. But I don't really value share from promotional loan. And so in general, we're going to be focusing on being efficient with how we spend our promotions and being disciplined about it. Especially, Kevin, as you might imagine in this environment, we're certainly pricing and price realizations important given what's happening with the cost front. Kevin Grundy -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Thanks, Mike. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer And then on the rest of -- just generally on between the lines for the quarter at 15.6%, that's low. And the main driver of that is around incentive comp. As you can imagine with the updated forecast, the incentive payments will be meaningfully lower. And in the third quarter, we not only step those down, but we also had basically an accrual adjustment true-up from the first half. So there was a sizable benefit on incentive comp reflected in the third quarter, and I will call out that we expect in the fourth quarter that the -- between the lines will step back up. And that's two things, we won't have the incentive comp true-up accrual, and seasonally our SG&A runs higher in the fourth quarter than in the rest of the year. Kevin Grundy -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Thank you, both. It's so seemingly, Mike, it's -- the retailers that are driving more of this, just not to put words in your mouth, but it seems like there is an appetite there among the retailers to normalize the categories, is that fair? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, I don't -- I wouldn't put it all at retailers. I mean, I think, the manufacturers also rely on it as well. Maybe, certainly, my kind of attitude or philosophy before it is I think I've said it before. I don't like to rent share through promotion. If we can use promotion to drive the trial that we won on our innovation, I'm supportive of that. And so that's a little bit. I think, I may have a slightly different take than others, but I wouldn't lay it at the bit of our customers. They're great partners. Our categories matter to them. And obviously, they matter a lot to us and so, so it's a symbiotic relationship. Kevin Grundy -- Jefferies -- Analyst Understood. Thank you for all the color. I appreciate it. Good luck. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Peter. Peter Grom -- UBS -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Maria, and Mike, I just kind of want to go back to the 2022 margin recovery and maybe just a housekeeping one. First, I'd like following upon Dara's question, the halfway through the year or maybe a little bit longer is when you expect margin expansion. Is that year-over-year or when do you expect margins to return to more normal historical levels and is that gross margin or operating margin? My thought would be expansion in gross margin, but just wanted to confirm. And then this is a bit more conceptual, but I just want to understand, how you think about adding back advertising next year, particularly as of the supply constraint get better gross margin improves, like how do you balance, you know, recovery of operating margins back to the high-teens versus reinvesting back in the business to set yourself up for growth in years to come, particularly given the lower spend you will be cycling this year? Thanks. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Peter, I'll start and then Mike can chime in. Though next year, we'll have some interesting dynamics and it's probably going to be a bit of a tale to have when you look at the first half of this year and the second half of this year, that's going to drive some year-over-year comps that will have some different dynamics. And as I said, we'll have to see really how commodities play out and how pricing plays out, and I would characterize it as we'll look to recover margins over time, we are very focused on margin recovery, and exactly when that's going to happen, I'm not prepared to say, but we'll have a lot more to say on that in January when we have three months more of visibility and three months more of additional actions that will take as the management team. We're working through our 2022 planning cycle now. And so, we're pulling that together, and given the volatility and the lack of visibility that we've had, it's too early to call the year, but we'll give you our best view in January. And Mike, I think, you can probably comment on advertising and how you see that unfolding. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Peter, we've actually increased our advertising investment significantly over the last few years, and we feel good about that and clearly, I think, that showing up in the numbers in terms of the organic growth and the overall health of the brands that we've -- as I've talked about earlier on this call. So we feel good about that. I would say at this point, we will look to continue to build out, we're probably operating kind of in the 5% plus or minus 5% range of sales. And still little lower than our primary competitors. I would like that to be higher over time. Although, we'll probably never will match some of our competitors at the same level they will, but I still think we can productively invest more and make that a win-win for the brand, while growing our margins at the same time. The unique thing about advertising in this environment or kind of as digital's unfolds that is the returns are much better than they historically have been. And so we continue to improve our efficiencies, we're getting better at that. And so for us, we're going to continue to look for ways to grow the business and that's going to include through advertising investments. At the same time, Maria, and I will also work to deliver a balanced plan that will deliver as we just mentioned margin improvement over time while delivering improved organic growth. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, and I'd add that [Speech Overlap] even outside of advertising, and when we look at between the lines and spending, I commented earlier, but embedded in there. I should note beyond incentive compensation dynamics, we are reducing other discretionary spending including in the, kind of, core SG&A and at the same time, we're continuing to invest primarily around IT digital types of investments and our commercial capability development. And so on the P&L, you don't see the full net effect of the actions that we're taking there, because we are continuing to invest, we -- the commodity inflation ran up on us quickly it was far in excess of what we expected in the third quarter, but we are continuing to make investments in the company for the long-term and we're very committed to what -- to doing that and focused on the long-term health of the company and the brands. Peter Grom -- UBS -- Analyst Great, thank you so much, and best of luck. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Yes. Hey guys. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Steve. Steve Powers -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Hey, Mike. So could you talk a little bit about FORCE savings? It's coming a little bit -- the lower end of your plan. And against the rising cost back up I guess I've been sort of talked to think of those two numbers as positively correlated. So as cost inflation goes up your procurement savings tend to also increase, obviously, we're not seeing that right at this moment. So is that -- what do I -- what should I glean from that? And in the near-term and is it temporary? Does that reaccelerate -- this FORCE savings reaccelerate into '22, because timing issue or is it some kind of indication that you are starting to run out of runway on FORCE? Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer Sure. We're definitely not running out of runway on FORCE. And we continue to see opportunities in the supply chain and some of the digital supply chain investments that I referenced earlier in the call will help us unlock those opportunities. The FORCE cost savings for this year is really affected by the supply chain challenges that we've been facing, which are a headwind for our cost savings and it's related to production and distribution inefficiencies caused by demand volatility and also the logistics issues that we've been talking about. The way that the FORCE cost savings program works is, of the negotiated material prices, a piece of it, which I'll come back and talk about in a minute. And then we have core productivity, and our supply chain operations, as well as product revisions to achieve design to value savings. So in the quarter, we had very good savings associated with the negotiated material prices. We also had benefits from productivity improvements and product changes, but not as much as we were hoping and you have to net positive in terms of total delivered cost for it to count as FORCE cost savings. So as you have headwinds coming in, they offset the gross FORCE cost savings that we would report. And that's really what we're seeing now. The headwinds that are flowing through manufacturing are dampening the net results of FORCE, but they're strong growth savings there. The other issue that we've got on FORCE is our supply chain folks are very focused on managing through this near-term environment to get product produced and to get it to customers. So we can get in the hands of consumers and that leaves less time for our employees to be working on productivity initiatives within the supply chain. So it's really those two things that are lowering the FORCE cost savings number for this year. But we have a healthy amount of room to go in terms of driving supply chain productivity as we move forward. Steve Powers -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. So playing it back, is the bottlenecks on the supply chain hopefully alleviate themselves then you have essentially some pent-up FORCE savings, that should come to the surface? Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer We do, and I should go back to the other part of your question, right? There is really two pieces of those FORCE cost savings, the negotiated material prices, our savings are much higher this year given the contract structure versus the rapid inflation on the commodity side. Those contracts get reset on a regular basis. So it will be reset at higher levels. So when I look forward, I wouldn't expect as much benefit as we had this year. Because if you think about where we were coming into 2020 versus where commodities went, we got a sizable benefit in FORCE guys [Phonetic] there this year. So that's the piece of it. But on the core productivity, I would expect us to have more savings on that part of it as we move forward. Steve Powers -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Got it. Okay, perfect. And then if I could pivot, you talk to the incremental pricing and Mike you touched upon through the views on trade and promo in the conversation with Kevin. But I guess I was looking to think about next year and whether the path to margin recovery is really list price-focused? Or if there are sizable revenue growth management opportunities that you have around the list price, and just what the balance of that is, as you sort of think about just the building blocks into 2022? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. It's all of that. So great question, Steve, and great perspective. I think, I would share yours which is I think it's a balanced deployment. Obviously, this year we went with list, because it can be a little quicker and a little more efficient to implement for both us and our customers. That said, I think long-term in our categories I would say for us it would be a combination of list pack, right, pack counts and pack architecture right and sizing, and then also promotion strategy, right? And I think all those are fertile ground for us. I've been talking about our revenue growth management for a couple of years now. We're still early in the journey and getting better at it. But we have a lot of great tools globally that we're using to support our planning and I think we're getting more and more disciplined about it. And again I think the balance across the levers will be important for us into next year, but I think going forward. Steve Powers -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Great. Thanks to you both. Appreciate it. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Steve. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Nik. Nik Modi -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yes, thanks. Good morning. So, Mike, just a question on price elasticity. Obviously, things have looked pretty good, the consumers are on pretty good shape. But I stimulus kind of fades all that cash these consumers are sitting on starts to dwindle as we get into 2022. How are you guys thinking about potential pricing and price elasticity? Just I feel like more is going to need to happen, because we all -- I think get the joke here that costs are going to continue to rise. And so I just wanted to get an understanding. Do you have any strategies in place to, kind of, minimizing the amount of price shock that some of these consumers might be -- as we get into 2022? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, I mean, Nick, I was just talking about with Steve again I think we've investing a lot of tools and so at this point, I think our elasticity modeling is pretty good fairly accurate. I would say, given our categories Nik that the elasticity tends to be a little less when realized than what predicted, just because if you look at these -- bad tissue the consumption doesn't change that much. Maybe the value-tier you purchase at may shift a little bit. And so there is that dynamic, but we are sensitive toward that and it's also while what's core to our strategy is developing a great value proposition to our consumer, and so we're always cognizant of that. And I think one of the things that we've done in many markets around the world is offer a great proposition on both the value side and also the premium side. And while our strategy, generally is to elevate our categories and expand our categories, I do think pricing in our categories with the premiumization of our categories is a little less than some of the others that I worked in the past, so I still think there's room to grow. However, we want to be able to shift and that's what we've done in a market like Latin America. And one of the reasons why we've grown share this year is because we've been able to pivot between our premium tier and our value-tier. For reference, two years ago we are making a student body left to go premium and we shifted a significant portion of our mix in Brazil from value to premium and over the past 18-months, we've been shifting it back the other way, because that's what the consumer needs. And so we're really cognizant of that, we're aware of the elasticities. Thus far, I would say, our volumes have held up, although I think what's really happening is we're seeing the intended elasticity, but we do have brands growth initiatives that are offsetting some elasticity impact. Nik Modi -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Pass it on. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. Thanks, Nik. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Jason. Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for swapping me in. Two questions, first, just a follow-up for clarification. I thought Dara asked when you expect price and cost to be effectively net neutral. I don't think he asked when do you expect margins recovery? I think most of the answers have been around margin recovery. But -- so can you clarify you're not expecting price to be caught up with costs until the back half of next year or not even, like even that's too optimistic. It's somewhere beyond the midpoint of next year when price actually catches up with cost ceteris paribus? Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer I think we'll hold on the 2022 comments until we get to January and then we'll have more to say about that once we have three months more visibility into what's happening in the commodity market, what's happening with price that's either in the market or will be in the market and we'll give you our best view there. I don't think it's productive to speculate on that right at this point given the volatility. Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yes, I'm just trying to -- tell me what you actually said. Because I think I've heard like two different explanations on next year. So if you actually said [Technical Issues] had a lot in 2022. I'm just looking for a clarification on what you actually did say. But I appreciate if you don't want to add more. So pivoting back to just the core business then good momentum on personal care, I mean, you're getting your price, your market shares are holding up the business has turned back to a degree of profit growth, all pretty encouraging. But the tissue business looks very different especially on the margin degradation side and the lack of price momentum. Can you elaborate on what's holding you back on price? What actions have you taken? What is in market now and why we are not seeing more momentum on price so far? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Again, I think what you're seeing in Personal Care, we did moved very early on when we had our commodity forecast update in the first quarter and so we did move on that. At the time, I think the tissue side or the fiber side was less clear and so, I would say we probably moved a little slower on the tissue side. We have announced some broad pricing actions in multiple markets, since then and so that's why I said earlier, Jason, that I would expect our tissue price realization to continue to improve as the year progresses. Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Have you raised prices in the US in tissue? Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer We announced some price changes in August with our retailers. Jason English -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I have two questions, one is a follow-up on the supply chain disruptions looking ahead on availability of raw materials and transportation lines we believe those will linger into the first half of 2022 setting aside the pricing commentary that you may not be ready to just in terms of availability of raw materials and transportation? And then a second one on the category growth between tracked and untracked channels. Did you see bricks growing faster than e-commerce, because of the tough comparisons in the quarter. And do you see the share issues that you alluded to in North America, mostly due to the fact that your competitors took longer to take pricing? Or is that more of a availability issue? Thank you. Maria Henry -- Chief Financial Officer I'll start with supply chain disruptions. I don't see a near-term catalyst for them improving. I think the labor issues in the US are very real and that's where we are feeling the brunt of the challenges on the supply chain side. More globally, I mentioned the UK market, but also with global shipping those issues are also quite challenging in a number of our markets. But the most acute issues and meaningful cost increases versus what we had been expecting is in North America and in that the labor market in the US, I just don't see a near-term catalyst. So I think the headwinds and the increased distribution costs will certainly be with us into 2022 and we'll have to see all of this plays out, it's not just affecting us of course, it's affecting companies quite broadly and where we're all dealing with these challenges. And then Mike, on category and share, I'll turn that one over to you. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Again, online continues to perform very well for us and then on track as well and so I think that's probably why there's probably discrepancy in our view of our market share performance, which we see as a little stronger than maybe what you might see and so overall, we feel very good about that and the category growth actually in both channels. And I think our brands are performing well the issue that we've had on share a couple of different areas in North America, it's primarily been an issue around supply. And so, even though we've made substantial improvement in our fulfillment throughout the course of the year, we're still not meeting all orders out there. And so our share is still a little light from that dimension. And then in a couple of other markets, again, I think it is as you pointed out, maybe some relative price indices that have expand a little bit in the short-term. We've moved on pricing in most markets. And well, we've generally seen moves from branded competition, we haven't seen that in all markets. And so there's still a little softness we're experiencing in Western Europe and in some markets in Latin America. Andrea Teixeira -- JPMorgan -- Analyst And Mike just to -- and I appreciate you both. But just on the track channels and non-tracked, e-commerce how much it grew this quarter vis-a-vis last year and how much represents now globally. Well, if you have growth number that would be helpful. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Overall, globally, we're probably in the mid to high-teens at this point, I don't have the growth rate off hand. But yes, in the strong double digits, is what I would say. Andrea Teixeira -- JPMorgan -- Analyst On top of like I would -- some also a very strong performance last year. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Strong performance last year, right. What the great new has been our fastest grower was our biggest market. So that was good last year. And so what -- again, you know, online continues to be important and increasingly important and we're operating very well there. Andrea Teixeira -- JPMorgan -- Analyst Okay, great. Thank you. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator Thank you. There are no more questions at this time. Michael D. Hsu -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Okay, well thank you all for taking the time to be with us today. We're working hard to drive sustainable brand growth and taking further action to ensure that we improve our margins and earnings profile. So thank you all.

The stock is retracing now -- up \"only\" about 16.6% as of 1:30 p.m. And it all began with a tweet. Image source: Getty Images. So what At 12:15 p.m. EDT, a virtually unknown company by the name of \"Orbital Reef\" tweeted that it plans to build \"a commercial space station transforming human space travel and opening access to new markets\" and that it has enlisted Boeing ( NYSE:BA ) , Sierra Space (a subsidiary of Sierra Nevada Corporation), Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space company, and Redwire, too, as its partners. Announcing #OrbitalReef -a commercial space station transforming human space travel and opening access to new markets. Our team developing the premier commercial destination in low Earth orbit: @BlueOrigin @SierraSpaceCo @BoeingSpace @RedwireSpace @ASU https://t.co/PP4wxrfkF3 pic.twitter.com/qJDdYg7BSv — Orbital Reef (@OrbitalReef) October 25, 2021 Within minutes, Redwire had its response tweet ready, confirming its participation in the Orbital Reef project and explaining that its role will be \"providing microgravity research, development and manufacturing; payload operations; and deployable structures like our ROSA solar arrays!\" We are proud to be on the #OrbitalReef team, providing microgravity research, development and manufacturing; payload operations; and deployable structures like our ROSA solar arrays! https://t.co/1d1u99gtld — Redwire Space (@RedwireSpace) October 25, 2021 Now what So...exciting times! And a rewarding day for early investors in the former space SPAC. But what does all of this mean for investors in Redwire over the long term? That's an excellent question because while Orbital Reef's announcement was full of excitement, it was rather empty of details on when, for example, the new space station project might get underway; how much Redwire might be paid for its services; or how profitable this project might turn out to be for the new space company. All we really know at this point are what can be gleaned from Orbital Reef's new website , which indicates that (1) the new space station won't be operational until \"the end of this decade\" and -- this could be the biggest news -- that (2) Blue Origin owns the copyright to Orbital Reef's name. Translation: This is a Jeff Bezos project, and Redwire, Sierra Nevada, and even Boeing are just subcontractors.",

    "content": "Markets closed flat; Sensex gains 145 points & Nifty ends at 18125Markets closed flat; Sensex gains 145 points & Nifty ends at 18125Indian equity indices snapped their four-day losing streak in a volatile trading session and closed almost flat on Monday, October 25, 2021. The S&P BSE Sensex gained 145.43 points, or 0.24 per cent to close at 60,967.05. The Nifty 50 index rose 10.50 points or 0.06 per cent at 18,125.40. The Nifty Bank added 868.75 points or 2.15 per cent to end at a fresh high of 41,192.40. The broader markets underperformed the Sensex at the BSE with S&P BSE MidCap declined 1.65 per cent while S&P BSE SmallCap lost 1.76 per cent.Sellers outnumbered buyers. On the BSE, 1043 shares rose and 2,312 shares fell. On the Nifty 50 index at the NSE, 11 shares advanced and 39 shares declined. The top five gainers on Nifty 50 were ICICI Bank (up 11.52 per cent), Axis Bank (up 3.47 per cent), ONGC (up 2.71 per cent), Tech Mahindra (up 0.89 per cent) and JSW Steel (up 0.85 per cent). The top five losers were BPCL (down 3.32 per cent), Bajaj Finserv (down 3.26 per cent), SBI Life (down 2.93 per cent), Bajaj Auto (down 2.63 per cent) and Tata Motors (down 2.46 per cent). International Markets Asian markets traded mixed today ahead of a week packed with major quarterly earnings announcements. So, Japan's Nikkei-225 index fell 0.7 per cent; Singapore's Straits Times index shed 0.1 per cent. But China's Shanghai Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent and South Korea's Kospi index ended 0.5 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended marginally higher. In Europe, London's FTSE-100 had risen 0.5 per cent and Germany's DAX had gained 0.3 per cent, but France's CAC-40 had shed 0.1 per cent, in intra-day trade. Economy Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched PM Ayushman Bharat Infrastructure Mission from Varanasi with a total outlay of Rs 64,180 crore. Addressing a public meeting at Mehandiganj in Varanasi after launching the scheme nationwide the Prime Minister said PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission aims to strengthen the critical healthcare network from village to block to the district to the regional and national level in the next four-five years. Mr Modi said under this Mission his government will develop the network of treatment and critical care units in every nook and corner of the country with an aggressive approach. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the US central bank was \"on track\" to begin reducing its purchases of assets. Meanwhile, IHS Markit's survey of senior business executives in service-oriented companies rebounded to a three-month high of 58.2 from 54.9 in September. A similar survey of manufacturers slipped to 59.2 from 60.7. China's economy risks slowing faster than global investors realize as President Xi Jinping's push to cut its reliance on real estate and regulate sectors from education to technology combine with a power shortage and the pandemic. Leading American banks are among those sounding the warning that expansion will fall short this year of the 8.2 per cent anticipated by the consensus of economists. The slump could last into next year, forcing growth below 5 per cent, they warn. Outside the 2020s 2.3 per cent, would be the weakest in three decades. Strategists at Bank of America muse that Chinese President Xi Jinping may even be embracing a once-in-two decades restructuring of the economy akin to Deng Xiaoping's modernisations of the late-1970s and Zhu Rongji's revamping of state enterprises and finance in the 1990s. If so, the data flow from China could confound even the pessimists, and we are on guard for that scenario unfolding, the strategists said in a report last week, in which they predicted growth of 7.7 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 2022.",

As of 2:03 p.m. EDT, its shares were up 10.3%. Record quarterly profits lifted investor enthusiasm in the bank stock as investors now see it even better poised to benefit from India's growing economy. So what ICICI Bank released a solid set of second-quarter numbers for fiscal 2022 on Saturday. Notable numbers (all changed year over year) from the earnings report include: 17% jump in deposits to $131.7 billion. 19% growth in domestic loan portfolio. 25% surge in net interest income. 26% rise in noninterest income. 23% jump in core operating profit (profit before provisions and tax, excluding treasury income) to $1.3 billion. 29% growth in profit after tax to $821 million. Image source: Getty Images. With India's economy reopening after the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the nation hard in April-May, ICICI Bank saw a surge in demand for loans: Its retail loans, which made up 51.6% of its total loan portfolio, soared 20% year over year in the third quarter. Deposits also grew rapidly as investors locked in higher interest rates before a potential fall. Most importantly, ICICI Bank's asset quality improved considerably, with its net nonperforming assets declining 12% sequentially to $1.1 billion. The bank opened nine new branches during the quarter, taking its total to 5,277. It also reported strong traction in its digital and payments platforms, especially in its mobile banking application facility that was extended for use for nonaccount holders in December 2020. Nearly 1.5 million non-ICICI Bank customers registered on the app, called iMobile Pay, last quarter, taking the total number up to 4 million as of the end of September. The volume of transactions from such customers jumped almost 13-fold in Q3. Now what It's the second-largest private bank in India, right behind HDFC Bank , in terms of total assets, and the third-largest bank among private and public banks. With ICICI Bank's loan mix and asset quality improving substantially and its net interest margin coming in at 4% versus HDFC Bank's net interest margin of 4.1% last quarter, investors are betting on the bank to overtake its closest rival in the coming quarters, sending the red-hot international stock flying through the roof.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Chris Smalls (center) and Amazon Labor Union members and supporters in Staten Island. Chris Smalls Note: This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Errol Schweizer: Can you give us a quick summary about how you got started working at Amazon and what led to your dismissal? Chris Smalls: I started working at Amazon back in 2015. I came in entry level, worked hard, got promoted up to a supervisor level. My first year, I opened up two more buildings after that first facility, one in Connecticut. And then my last facility was JFK Staten Island, currently where I'm at right now. So I was a supervisor for four and a half years. I oversaw the outbound operation. And last year when the virus hit, Amazon failed to protect us, provide PPE, provide any safety measures, guidelines. And as a supervisor, I felt it was my responsibility to protect my fellow co-workers who I spend 40 to 60 hours a week with, and I consider my extended family. And when I had a meeting with my higher ups, my bosses, they told me not to tell the employees that I'm overseeing that somebody tested positive. And that's when I took my stance against the company. I held the walkout on March 30, 2020. And two hours after that walkout I was terminated. And from that moment, I pretty much was catapulted into the media spotlight. The week after I got terminated Jeff Bezos, along with the general counsel himself, signed off on a smear campaign, calling me not smart, not articulate, which ironically made me the face of the whole unionizing effort against Amazon. And fast forward to Alabama/Bessemer, what happened several months ago. That's exactly what we're trying to do. We're trying to pick up where they left off, and hopefully become successful in Staten Island. So we began the campaign about six months ago. And currently, that's where we’re at. We're in the middle of a heated campaign against Amazon as we speak. And I'm just trying to lead these workers into a victory. Errol: Tell us a bit about how the RWDSU Bessemer campaign influenced this work. Chris: Yeah, they definitely laid down the blueprint of how to get it done. I drove 16 hours down there with some of my colleagues who are actually current Amazon workers. And we spent some time on the ground. And we saw a lot of missed opportunities. And when we came back to Staten Island, we decided to say, no, we're going to wait for the results. After the results, then we're going to figure out how we're going to go. And that's exactly what we did. After the results came out, we knew that we wanted to strike while the iron was hot. And that's exactly what we're doing now. We didn't waste any time. We jumped right into our campaign. And we're organizing differently, organizing from within.

Chris Smalls Errol: What is your critique of Amazon and how they treat employees? Chris: Amazon treats workers like numbers. They run completely off of metrics. Everything is calculated from the moment you clock in and clock out. And that's what we try to express to the workers that we're trying to organize. You get a station number you're at 10, 11, 12 hours a day. You get a 30 minute lunch, which is obviously not enough time to walk across these massive buildings which are a million square feet and you're on your feet all day. Your body hurts, your body aches. You're doing repetitive work. So you're hurting the same limbs every day, straining the same limbs every day. You're bending, you're reaching, you're pulling, and these are real people that are being hurt and affected. That's what we try to explain and express to the public as well, they don't see behind the scenes, how their packages are being delivered. Errol: What is the Amazon Labor Union? How did it come about? And what are the goals and vision of this new organization? Chris: So, the Amazon Labor Union is a completely worker-led independent union, brand new from scratch, created by current Amazon workers. Here in Staten Island, we have four buildings. So this is going to be a very powerful union once we get established. These workers are resilient, they are brave, they're organizing themselves and the Amazon Labor Union can't be a better organization when it comes to organizing against Amazon, because they know the ins and outs of the company. The lead organizers here, including myself, we've been a part of Amazon for five plus years. Some of them worked for Amazon almost seven years or more. And so we're trying to hopefully spread like wildfire, once we're successful here. Errol: So what are some of the tactics you're using for recruiting folks? Chris: It's just the conversations, the face to face conversations. And as far as the workers that are organizing, these face to face interactions with their co-workers are the best way. We do use social media, obviously. But we do several things. We held 5 going on 6 barbecues, we had our press conferences, we invite musical guests, and we feed the workers daily and give out waters, donuts, coffee, you name it, we give it out every single day. Those types of connections really resonate with the workers. Amazon doesn't do any of these things, only as a reaction to what we're doing. They took away all their food vendors. So we've been giving out free food. They took away their hazard pay. They got workers that are living in shelters, some of them even homeless, and we're raising money for these workers. We're trying to amplify their stories. And we also obviously filed several lawsuits since we started. We have several unfair labor practice lawsuits pending right now with the NLRB. So we're just organizing differently with these tactics, and I think this is very effective going up against Amazon. Small victories matter. You have to earn the trust with the workers and you’ve got to put in the work on the ground. Chris Smalls, Reverend Jesse Jackson and an ALU colleague. Chris Smalls Errol: How has Amazon reacted to your on the ground organizing efforts in Staten Island? Chris: Oh, wow. They, well, they built this prison fence up to stop us from connecting with workers. They call the police on us, they call the fire department on us. They put the signs in the bathrooms, like they did in Bessemer. They send out text messages, they send out emails. They have the same union busting firm, walking around the building, spreading rhetoric, spreading lies, spreading doubt. We've seen it all. I mean, they didn't hesitate with us. They started probably the first or second week. They didn't wait six or seven months into our campaign, which tells us that we're a real threat. Errol: So these are some of the same tactics they used in Bessemer. And does it worry you that those tactics were very effective in stopping the Bessemer campaign? Chris: The way they were union busting in Alabama, with the intimidation factor, they had police at every single interest entrance of the facility. Every single day. They gave out what we call Amazon swag, like “vote no” pins and shirts, stickers, they gave out incentive money, they paid workers to quit before the vote, we're expecting the same thing. But here in New York is a different energy. New York is a union town already. A lot of these workers are related to union members, whether it's their parents or grandparents, they get off the bus, the MTA is unionized. Even the police department is unionized, the Fire Department is unionized. So everything that Amazon is trying to do with us it's not working, it's actually backfiring. Because they're going so hard with the union busting that workers are realizing is probably something that they need. Errol: What are some of the positives that workers hope to have by being a member of a union? Chris: Well, the number one thing is salary. A unionized worker makes roughly eleven to twelve thousand dollars more than non-unionized workers. Every unionized worker that I know, every unionized worker here in New York, they make very good money. They have a pension, they have job security. They have representation. They have Medicare, Medicaid, paid medical leave, you name it, the sky's the limit when you're in the Union. And when it comes to non-unionized workers, you know, companies can hire us and fire us at will. And that's what we tell workers that start here, that just got hired, this company can walk you out the next day for no reason. And that's what we have to stop. We have to break down that system and form something that's going to protect us. Errol: How can folks support your work? Chris: This is a very grassroots campaign. We have a GoFundMe up , on Twitter at Amazon labor union , or our website . Please donate to our GoFundMe. Every penny comes in and out right towards unionizing Amazon. So be a part of history. We're in the very beginning stages of our fight. We need as much as support on the inside of the warehouses. We need that on the community level as well. So please support us in any aspect.",

Welcome to the HNI Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Matt McCall, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead. Matthew S. McCall -- Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development Good morning. My name is Matt McCall. I'm Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development for HNI Corporation. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2021 results. With me today are Jeff Lorenger, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Marshall Bridges, Senior Vice President and CFO. Copies of our financial news release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations are posted on our website. Statements made during this call that are not strictly historical facts are forward-looking statements, which are subject to known and unknown risk. Actual results could differ materially. The earnings presentation posted on our website includes additional factors that could affect actual results. The corporation assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Jeff Lorenger. Jeff? Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, our members stayed focused on servicing our customers while we continue to experience ripple effects from the pandemic, which are creating constraints in the near term. While we drove strong order growth, ongoing difficulties tied to labor availability, supply chain disruptions, and inflation across all input cost categories negatively impacted our results. Despite these pressures, we are increasingly encouraged about 2022 given the actions we are taking, the ongoing recovery in Workplace Furnishings, and strength in Residential Building Products. Our two differentiated business segments are well-positioned to benefit from multiple secular trends and numerous HNI-specific growth initiatives. We have a track record of effectively deploying capital, driving annual productivity and cost savings, and managing through macro and operational challenges. On today's call, I will cover three key points. First, we are addressing the constraints negatively impacting our second half results. Second, our Residential Building Products segment continues to deliver strong revenue and profit growth. And third, demand in Workplace Furnishings continues to improve. I will cover these three key points. Marshall will then go through our fourth quarter outlook. I will conclude with some general comments and finally, we will open up the call to your questions. I will now cover our first key point, what we are doing to address the near-term macrodynamics impacting our business. As we discussed in our business update on September 23, we continue to generate strong order growth across our businesses. Workplace Furnishings orders in the third quarter increased 31% versus the prior-year period, and we're 5% above third quarter 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Residential Building Products orders in the third quarter were 35% higher year-over-year. We have market momentum and our capturing demand. However, our third quarter profit was below prior-year levels and was well below our potential due to three constraints, all of which we are addressing. The first constraint is labor availability. There are simply fewer people in the labor pool than there were before the pandemic. This has prevented us from increasing production as fast as we would like. Our current production staffing is 11% or approximately 340 members, lower than what we would like to have given the strong demand we are generating. Along with the reduced labor pool, we have experienced increased impacts from COVID as the Delta variant ramped up in the third quarter. This has temporarily amplified the staffing shortage at our facilities and with our suppliers. To combat this issue, we're taking several steps. First, we're making our operations more efficient. Much of this is being driven by our lean manufacturing expertise. For instance, at one of our larger facilities, we're altering the layout and flow, which will allow us to improve output at that location by 17% with the same head count. We are also pursuing productivity gains related to automation. Second, our new facility in Mexico will provide an additional source of labor to help meet growing demand. We expect that location to employ 250 members once it is fully ramped up next year. Third, we continue to aggressively hire, move production to facilities where labor is more readily available and assess new labor pools with part time and seasonal programs. These efforts are getting traction, and we have seen staffing levels improve over the last 45 days. That brings us to our second constraint, supply chain capacity. Like many, we are experiencing disruptions largely tied to staffing shortages at suppliers, port congestion and material availability. These items limited our ability to keep up with demand and also made our members less productive. To strengthen our supply chains, we have started to diversify the supply base, create inventory buffers and increase our monitoring and coordination efforts with key suppliers. We will continue to focus on these efforts as we expect supply chains to remain stressed for the foreseeable future. The third dynamic is rampant inflation across all input-cost categories. Input costs increased $44 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year, which is by far, the most inflation we have ever seen in the quarter. All of our input-cost categories experienced increases led by steel and ocean freight. We have responded with aggressive pricing actions, the cumulative benefit of which will allow us to fully offset these cost pressures. Accordingly, our price cost headwind is temporary. We expected to narrow in the fourth quarter and turn positive early next year. We are taking a more agile and aggressive approach with pricing moving forward. We are prepared to manage in an ongoing inflationary environment and have the market power to get ahead and stay ahead of these headwinds. My second key point is residential building products delivered strong results despite increasingly difficult comps and multiple sources of pressure. Revenue in our Residential Building Products segment increased 25% year-over-year in the third quarter on an organic basis. As I mentioned earlier, segment orders increased 35% year-over-year. Growth in the Remodel Retrofit Channel slightly outpaced the new construction channel, despite increasingly difficult comps in R&R. Our Building Products segment was impacted by the three factors I discussed earlier, and as a result, lead times have extended and price costs continued to be negative. However, our members worked hard to maintain production output and service levels, and the business generated more than 10% year-over-year operating profit and an EBIT margin of more than 17%. As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the prospects for both Remodel Retrofit and New Construction. As we have stated previously, our residential building products business is supported by favorable trends and unique opportunities. Long-term demographic trends and a housing supply demand imbalance will continue to support a prolonged housing cycle and elevated remodeling activity. Nesting and de-urbanization trends also provide secular support. And we have an outstanding opportunity to organically grow the category in both new construction and remodel retrofit. In addition, we have opportunities to enhance our strategic position through acquisitions. As an example, earlier this month, we acquired Trinity Hearth and Home, a large installing distributor headquartered in the Dallas metro area. Trinity generates approximately $40 million of annual revenue and employs approximately 100 members. Trinity will act as a hub to better serve the rapidly growing southwest region, and it further strengthens our unique, vertically integrated business model and regional distribution infrastructure. Following this acquisition, we now own 26 Fireside Hearth & Home locations. We're excited to have Trinity join the HNI family. Our third key point, demand in Workplace Furnishings continues to recover with year-over-year order growth of at least 25% in each month of the quarter. In total, Workplace Furnishings orders increased 31% during the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we are seeing growth across all major channels. Although demand was strong, the three constraints discussed earlier drove a year-over-year profit decline. As I previously noted, we are addressing these constraints. And as we look into 2022, we expect a return to driving profitable growth. We are increasing our capacity, strengthening our supply chains and taking aggressive pricing actions to offset the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures. We also expect strong revenue growth in 2022, supported by our elevated backlog and the ongoing recovery. Our Workplace Furnishings businesses have unmatched price point breadth, channel access, and market reach, and we're investing in multiple strategic initiatives aimed at driving continued outperformance. We have unique exposure to fast-growing segments of the market including education, home office, and with small- to mid-sized customers. Our investments, along with our existing competitive differentiators, position us well to benefit from office reentry, work-from-home, and de-urbanization trends. I will now turn the call over to Marshall to provide some detail around our fourth quarter outlook. Marshall? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Okay. Let's start with our outlook for our fourth quarter revenue growth. We expect consolidated fourth quarter revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single digit percent range compared to the prior-year quarter, including the impact of acquisitions. Labor and supply chain issues are expected to limit our output in both segments again in the fourth quarter. In Workplace Furnishings, we expect growth in the mid-single digit percent range on a year-over-year basis including acquisition impacts. In Residential Building Products, we expect year-over-year growth rates in the high-single digit percent range including acquisitions. Next, let's cover fourth quarter profitability. We expect the margin pressures we faced in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect operating profit and earnings per share to be at or below what we just reported in the third quarter. As Jeff mentioned earlier, as we look to 2022, we are increasingly optimistic the combination of our order trends, backlog levels, increased capacity, and strengthened supply chains point to revenue strength, particularly for Workplace Furnishings in the seasonally lower first half. From a profitability perspective, we are addressing price cost. In 2021, we estimated price cost will be approximately a $60 million headwind. Next year, we expect to have positive price cost and recover much of 2021's deficit. As a result, we expect profitability, margins and earnings to recover in 2022. Finally, some comments on our cash flow and balance sheet expectations. Quarter ending debt levels were approximately $178 million. That was modestly lower than last quarter and up slightly from the third quarter of last year. The gross leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 0.9, unchanged from last quarter. And our projected cash flow will provide ample capacity for continued growth investment, dividend payments, and opportunistic M&A and buyback activity. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Marshall. Let me wrap up by stating that as we look forward, we remain optimistic about our businesses and our ability to drive profit growth. Our members continue to effectively manage through the post-pandemic environment, allowing us to maintain our revenue momentum. Our workplace -- our focus in our Workplace Furnishings is on expanding margins. Our focus in residential building products is on driving above-market revenue growth, while maintaining our strong margins. As we move past the recent headwinds, we'll do so well-positioned to grow revenue, expand margins and increase cash flow. I would like to conclude by stating I'm extremely proud of and thankful for the efforts of all HNI members, particularly given how hard everyone is working to overcome the constraints we have described. We will now open up the call to your questions. Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company. Greg Burns -- Sidoti & Co. LLC -- Analyst Good morning. I just want to start with the order patterns, order trends you're seeing throughout the quarter on both sides of the business. How they trended throughout the quarter and how you're -- what you're seeing in the early part of the fourth quarter? And then secondly to that, on the workplace side of the business. Are you seeing any change in forward indicators like mockups, pipeline opportunities like in terms of dollar value or a number of project opportunities you're seeing? Any change there that might indicate a shift in demand going forward, given what we're seeing with COVID? Thank you. Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Sure, Greg. Let's start with orders and Workplace Furnishings. For the segment, their orders were up 31% versus the prior year for the third quarter. And if you look at the individual components, you've cooked down each business. We were pretty consistent. So, we saw similar growth rates in the contract business, as well as the business focused on small to midsize offices. And the growth rates through the quarter were pretty similar. There were some noise related timing of price increases, but we exited the quarter pretty similar to the rate that we had for the whole quarter there. So, there's no change in trajectory, it feels pretty decent. In Residential Building Products, orders were up 35% versus the prior year. Remodel-retrofit was up a little more and new construction was about a low 30% growth range there. New construction was really consistent through the quarter. Remodel-retrofit has started to taper off now. It's not an issue of the dollar intake tapering off, that remains good. It's just we're starting to come up against some tougher comps in the prior year period. So, the growth rate is slowing as we might expect given the growth rates we saw late last year and early this. As it relates to forward-looking indicators, what I'd tell you is that we probably have a little bit less visibility than we normally would have on that front right now, Greg. The customers and the dealers maybe shifted a little bit more their focus to dealing with the here and now given the construction delays that are out there and just overall supply chain disruptions that we're seeing. So, I'm not sure we have great view of that. What we do see is that contract is strengthening and SMB business continues to be strong. Greg Burns -- Sidoti & Co. LLC -- Analyst Okay, OK. And you mentioned a focus on improving margins on the workplace side of the business. How should we think about, I guess, what your goal is or where you think that that business can get to because I know you were starting to see a little bit of improvement in '19 before the pandemic hit. So, I just wanted to get a feel for what your aspirations are for that segment and where you think you can get the margins over time, if inflation and some of these supply chain issues improve? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, long term, Greg, we believe we can get back to the margins we were at in the 2015-2016 timeframe in Workplace Furnishings. In the short term, we've got two big levers that will help us out in next year. The first one is improving price cost. Price cost is a major headwind this year. We're looking at about a $44 million negative price cost for Workplace Furnishings. And we think we can recover the majority of that next year, which can add approximately 300 basis points of margin. The second big lever in the short-term is just catching the ball and miss out there -- where our backlogs are extended, demand continues to run. As we increase our capacity and get more productive with the capacity we do have, we can capture some volume, maybe get another 150 basis points of margin expansion there. As you look into subsequent years, we're committed to expanding margin. We've got some efforts underway to improve underperforming businesses. And, of course, we've got our ongoing annual cost savings initiatives. Greg Burns -- Sidoti & Co. LLC -- Analyst Okay. So when you reference like 2015-'16, so that would be like a high, high single-digit kind of number to go back and look -- it looks like you're in the -- in that range, 8 to 10 kind of range? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. Greg Burns -- Sidoti & Co. LLC -- Analyst Okay. All right. Thank you. Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Greg. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Reuben Garner with The Benchmark Company. Reuben Garner -- The Benchmark Co. LLC -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So, it sounds like some optimism surrounding 2022. And Marshall, you mentioned $60 million of price cost drag that that is a way which I think is a little over $1 a share if my math is right. Does that include the all-encompassing -- is that an all-encompassing figure with the supply chain parts of it or is that purely sort of material costs? And I guess is there any other things to think about as we -- as we're putting together a bridge for 2022 other than that $60 million headwind going away? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Reuben. Our input costs include materials, wages, freight, your classic input costs. It doesn't include any kind of disruption to productivity related to supply chain disruptions and things like that. Yeah, I think as you look to next year, the two big levers is what I explained to Greg is the recovery of price cost and then the leverage off volume growth as we expand capacity and also use the capacity that typically isn't used in the first half. And there's -- we're not going to see a lot of seasonality next year in Workplace Furnishings just due to the pent-up demand and the backlogs we have. Reuben Garner -- The Benchmark Co. LLC -- Analyst Great. And that feeds nicely into my next question about the capacity additions. Can you put into perspective the Mexico operation? How much does that add to capacity? I think it's a ceding facility. Is that where you need capacity the most or is that just going to allow you to better utilize your facilities in the US for some other product categories? And then secondarily and sorry for the long-winded question, but the production rate, Jeff, that you mentioned, I think you said you're 11% short of where you want to be. Where does that number normally sit just kind of in a more normal environment, if there is such a thing? Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Reuben. Well, what I can tell you is the Mexico operation, yeah, it will relieve pressure overall in the network, so that's a positive thing. And we're -- it's multiple levers. It's additional hiring, it's enhanced productivity, it's shifting production around, it's Mexico, it's Marshall's point about level loading the first half as opposed to kind of the cyclical nature of the business. We're looking to increase output somewhere in the 15% to 20% range for 2022 over 2021 levels from a capacity output standpoint. So that's -- and it's not just isolated to Mexico, but it's kind of all those items. Reuben Garner -- The Benchmark Co. LLC -- Analyst Okay. And then -- that's great. And what kind of investment are you having to make to increase the productivity by that much? Is there going to be an incremental pressure on capex next year or is this within your sort of normal spending parameters? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Reuben, most of it is in our normal spending. The Mexico facility, obviously, is going to have a little bit more, but it's not a dramatic change. Mostly what we're trying to do is utilize the capacity we have and excess labor which is just not as capital intensive as some capacity expansions would be. Reuben Garner -- The Benchmark Co. LLC -- Analyst Okay. And then on the Workplace Furnishing side, I think there's some skepticism from investors, or I guess, unknown about the recent surge in demand, how much of it is catch-up from the last year? How much of it is a return to normalization? How much of it is spending to reconfigure the office to be better for or more COVID-friendly going forward? I know this is a tough question, but any sense from you guys on those three buckets what we're seeing right now, can you tell by the types of products that are being ordered? Is this just kind of things returning to the way they were prior to COVID or are there other factors? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer You know, Reuben, that's a great question. I think it's both end, to be candid. I think we're seeing people ramp up, particularly in some segments, education. The SMB businesses are moving forward with their life and their business is doing well. So, that's just demand coming online as those businesses do well. I don't think the reconfiguration for post-COVID has really hit yet. Those office reentry in major metros has been delayed. That -- so, that's still, I think, out there. I think we hear a lot of discussion about the war for talent and operating in a hybrid environment. And those -- I think that demand is still TBD as companies figure that out. So, I would characterize this as -- we've seen nice, nice return in certain segments of the business and that's driving our strong order patterns and there are -- there's still another couple of chapters to be played out as companies kind of auger through a return to office scenario and hybrid. And then you layer on top of that, the war for talent. And there's a lot of discussions underway about how that's going to play out. Reuben Garner -- The Benchmark Co. LLC -- Analyst Great. I'm going to sneak one more in. We haven't seen a surge in fuel or energy costs like this in a while. Back in '14 and '15, I think it was -- your Hearth business had a pretty big boost from folks looking for different ways to heat their homes in the winter. I guess any chance that we see something like that given the current environment? And then secondarily, do you have the capacity in that kind of area to service an uptick in demand if there was one? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's a great question, Reuben. We always enjoy talking about the pellet business. Yeah. We would expect that to run, given how high energy is. I would say we haven't necessarily seen it yet. So, I guess, it remains to be seen and we are pretty tight in capacity across the Hearth business, so we're going to have to figure out how to capture all that, but that's a potential upside for us as we go into next year. Reuben Garner -- The Benchmark Co. LLC -- Analyst Great. Thanks, guys. Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Reuben. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research. Steven Ramsey -- Thompson Research Group LLC -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thinking about the Q4 guidance, to start with sales. It looks like Q4 sales being better than Q3. Can you maybe go through how much of that is pricing flowing through and how much of that is better production and shipments? And then secondly, if Q4 sales are higher sequentially but profits at or below, what is driving that dynamics? Is it price cost or are there other items? Marshall Bridges -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. It's good question, Steve. Let me let me try to answer the second part of your question first. So as you look at the fourth quarter as it relates to the third quarter we said conditions would be generally the same. But there's a lot of moving parts that basically knit together, offset each other. So maybe walk through them and I think that answers both of your sub questions. So on the positive side, we are going to see better price cost. Our pricing is ramping up. And even though inflation continues to increase, we're going to narrow that gap. So that's an improvement sequentially. Also, the volume in residential building products will improve sequentially. That's really related more to shipping inventory we produced in -- earlier in the year. We're pretty tight on production as I said earlier. So those two positives get offset by basically three negatives. The first one is there's some seasonal uptick in the corporate unallocated overhead. We were about $11 million in the third quarter there. That should increase $7 million. But the year-over-year increase in each of those quarters is still pretty small just how those quarters are still pretty small, just how those costs flowed. We're also going to see fewer production days. This is a -- the fourth quarters got more holidays. And so, the Workplace Furnishings business will have lower unit volume, price excluded. And then lastly, we're going to see a little bit lower productivity, particularly in Workplace Furnishings related to two factors. One, starting up the New Mexico facility. And then secondly, supply chains are still not back to being healthy. So altogether, we're looking at pretty similar profitability and the volume picture excluding price depends on which segment. Steven Ramsey -- Thompson Research Group LLC -- Analyst Okay. Very helpful, very helpful. And then, thinking about the constraint improvement, is one improving sooner than another, thinking about supply or labor, getting better, how much of that is factored into your bridge to 2022? And kind of on the other side as these things get better, which one is a greater tailwind to profit, supply or labor and maybe some of this is chicken and egg? So maybe it's not right to break it out that way. Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think it's a good question. We watch this every day, Steven. And I think it is a bit of a chicken and egg. The labor pressure is kind of ripple through the supply chains as well, just like us. So we make, we're making some progress on both is what I would tell you. And we continue to have to try to balance those two things kind of in tandem. So candidly, if one runs way ahead of the other, it's not going to really net out as well as it could or should anyway. So we're really working hard at both of those levers. And we do expect improvement, stability first and improvement as we get into 2022 on both fronts. But like I said, it's kind of six to one. They both need to improve kind of at the same rate and as people -- and we've seen some stabilization in the supply chain. But we watch it daily. Steven Ramsey -- Thompson Research Group LLC -- Analyst Okay, great. And then last one for me, [Indecipherable] is known for being extremely efficient. And we talked to many people in the supply chain and in procurement that think just in time inventory will change permanently from this situation the world is in and therefore more companies will hold more inventory. So I guess, if you contemplated how you will change managing inventory and working capital as on the other side of the current issues. Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. That's a great question. And we have absolutely contemplated that. And I do think we're no different. We will be hearing more buffers. Candidly, if you even think about our business model, some of the small, medium-sized business that we have, we got some high runners that we can build ahead. And so we will definitely use the balance sheet appropriately to change that dynamic over time. Now, it won't happen overnight. But I do think we're entering a period here, maybe a permanent period in which the business is going to have to kind of reset its expectations on just in time versus inventory. I think that's a -- and we're going to be playing that point -- pulling some of those levers as we get into next year. Steven Ramsey -- Thompson Research Group LLC -- Analyst Helpful. Thank you. Jeffrey Lorenger -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call.

Restaurant Brands International inc ( NYSE:QSR ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 8:30 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Restaurant Brands International Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Stephen Lichtner, RBI's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Stephen Lichtner -- Head of Investor Relations Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Restaurant Brands International's earnings call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. As a reminder, a live broadcast of this call may be accessed through the Investor Relations web page at investor.rbi.com, and a recording will be available for replay. Joining me on the call today are Restaurant Brands International's CEO, Jose Cil; COO, Josh Kobza; and CFO, Matt Dunnigan. Today's earnings call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks set forth in the press release issued this morning and in our SEC filings. In addition, this earnings call includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in the press release available on our website. Throughout the call today, we will be referencing two-year comparisons for systemwide sales growth and comparable sales to provide a cleaner indication of how the business is trending versus a more normalized period. These two-year comparisons are calculated on a geometric stacked basis by using the 2020 and 2021 disclosed growth metrics. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jose. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our third quarter of 2021. I hope everyone is doing well. Before I dive into our results for the quarter, I'd like to highlight an important milestone for our Company. In 2020, we launched our Restaurant Brands for Good sustainability framework to address our food, the planet, and the people and communities we serve. During the quarter, we announced our goal to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, which was approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative and reach net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. These targets are a good example of the action-oriented approach we're taking to do our part to tackle climate change. The moment fraction is now and I'm personally extremely proud of the team's effort so far, getting us started on this important journey. Beyond doing right by the planet, we believe we're doing right by our guests, employees and shareholders who we know increasingly value brands that take sustainability seriously. And this progress is really important because our value proposition starts with our brands: TIM HORTONS, BURGER KING and POPEYES, all of which generate resilient, growing high-margin revenue streams through comparable sales growth and restaurant development, allowing us to reinvest in our business while also returning capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, we once again grew global comparable sales year-over-year driven by worldwide growth at TIM HORTONS and strong results from BURGER KING and POPEYES' international business, which offset softer performance from BURGER KING and POPEYES home markets. As compared to 2019, our systemwide sales growth accelerated to 5% versus 4% in Q2, driven by positive overall comparable sales growth and continued progress in our development pipeline. With 264 net new restaurants delivered during the quarter, keeping us on track to return to 2018, 2019 levels of growth this year. And looking ahead to 2022, based on our current pipeline, we believe we're well positioned to accelerate our net unit growth across all three brands and continue on our path to 40,000 restaurants. Our efficient operating model helps convert the systemwide sales growth to the bottom line, contributing to robust free cash flow generation that provides significant optionality, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return capital to shareholders through both dividends and open market share repurchases. We're making investments in key areas of the business such as building in-house technology and digital teams that we believe position us to add value directly to our guests and improve restaurant operations, investing behind our marketing plan at TIM HORTONS in Canada, accelerating the rollout of outdoor digital menu boards and investing in our people, especially in areas like technology, operations and marketing. We also returned roughly $240 million to our shareholders on October 5 in the form of a $0.53 per share quarterly dividend. Once again, maintaining the highest payout ratio in our industry. In addition, since announcing our expanded $1 billion buyback program at the end of July, we've repurchased and retired approximately 2.8 million shares in open market transactions totaling just over $180 million. These robust capital returns reflect the confidence we have in our brands, our view of our underlying intrinsic value and our outlook for the business. Before I turn to our brand level performance, I'd like to hand it over to Josh to provide you with a more detailed update on our development framework, a key driver of our long-term growth prospects, then also share an update on technology. Josh? Joshua Kobza -- Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jose, and good morning, everyone. As Jose mentioned, we have big aspirations to grow our restaurant base toward our long-term goal of 40,000 locations and we are confident we are well positioned to execute. We are fortunate to operate three iconic brands in some of the most attractive QSR categories. And within this landscape, we view ourselves as uniquely positioned to drive outsized growth. When we look at the unit count of our leading peers by category in key international regions, we see notable opportunities with the most compelling in Asia-Pacific, were taken together, our leading competitors have nearly 10 times the number of restaurants as we do. In addition, across EMEA, the leading peers have over 3 times the number of stores as us. And in Latin America and the Caribbean, they have more than double our footprint. And while this international runway is especially compelling, we also see growth opportunities closer to home in the US and Canada. Developing new restaurant business around the world is a key foundational strength of our team, and we are joined in our efforts by an exceptional network of master franchise partners who have the experience, local expertise, track record and capital to invest. And while we do not take a one-size-fits-all approach with our partners, working with local entrepreneurs, established restaurant operators, as well as strategic and financial partners, we do look for a few common threads across all of them. We seek our partners who share our vision for building out our brands to their full potential in end markets, have the capital resources to do so and have talented local management teams to execute on that vision. The success of our global development playbook is readily apparent when looking at BURGER KING's international growth, which includes a doubling of the brand's international store count since 2012 to nearly 12,000 locations and roughly 60% of the brands worldwide systemwide sales. In multiple markets, China, France, Russia, the team effectively started from scratch, identified a strong local partner, entered into a long-term master franchise and development agreement and created a robust business with a lasting presence and continued runway for growth. In fact, in these three markets alone, since 2012, we have built nearly 2,400 restaurants and created nearly $3 billion of annual systemwide sales. In Russia, for example, through a partnership with both a financial partner and a local entrepreneur, we've grown BURGER KING store count from just a handful of restaurants in 2011 to nearly 800 today, almost matching the market leader. Despite this robust international development, BURGER KING still has only half the number of restaurants globally versus the leading competitor, including only a third of the number of restaurants in Asia-Pacific, where we are building a strong foothold. As a result, we continue to see BURGER KING as a significant growth engine, and based on our current pipeline, we expect it to be the largest contributor to our net restaurant growth for the foreseeable future. We also expect the overall pace of our restaurant growth to benefit as we ramp up contributions from exciting master franchise relationships we've recently established for both TIM HORTONS and POPEYES. At TIM HORTONS, we are the undisputed leader in Canada. However, the brand remains significantly under-penetrated throughout the rest of the world. For example, we have just over 325 restaurants in Asia-Pacific, which is a fraction of the leading competitors approximately 10,500 stores. We've only just started scratching the surface with master franchise agreements in China, the UK, the Middle East, Mexico and others contributing to our year-to-date unit growth of 188 restaurants, which includes by far the fastest pace of international growth the brand has ever achieved. And we are actively working toward development projects in new markets to add to our existing pipeline and accelerate growth for years to come. We feel confident that TIM HORTONS brand can translate to markets all around the world, as has been demonstrated by our fast-paced growth in China, whereas many of you know, we only started in January 2019 and already expect to have over 350 locations by the end of this year. And this growth is only expected to accelerate with our partners driving a strong vision for the brand and aiming to propel Tims China to over 2,700 restaurants by 2026. Finally, we see opportunities at POPEYES to grow all around the world, and this year alone have signed commitments to develop some of the most important QSR markets, such as the United Kingdom, India, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, as well as expand our footprint in the US and Canada, further enhancing our visibility into achieving our long-term unit growth aspirations. The opportunity in the US is especially compelling for POPEYES. Our guest insights work shows the number one barrier to trial for the brand is convenience and with 50% of guests driving more than 10 miles to reach one of our restaurants, we see adding new locations closer to our guests as a significant long-term opportunity. We are excited about the roadmap for POPEYES, with the brand on track to achieve record unit growth this year, driven by contributions from key markets including the US, Canada, Spain and the Philippines and expected to further accelerate in 2022. Before handing it back to Jose, I also wanted to share some thoughts on our digital progress and in particular, a few insights from key international markets. We've discussed how building out and investing behind our technology platforms is a key priority. And when we look at our most advanced digital markets internationally, which also happen to be some of our largest and fastest-growing markets, we see just how important this is to driving digital sales. Our businesses in China and South Korea generate the vast majority of sales from digital channels, nearly 90%, with China in particular driving over 50% of sales from known diners. And in France, Spain and Russia, over half of sales already come from digital channels. There are a few notable common threads across these markets. One, each has a strong loyalty program in place with easy in-store authentication capabilities. Two, each recognizes the merits of an omnichannel approach utilizing kiosks, mobile order and pay, delivery and third-party partners to make it easy for guests to interact with the brand in their own way. Third, all quickly integrate new and emerging channels, including third-party delivery and social commerce, like WeChat and Kakao, to grow their customer base by ensuring the brand is present and has open communication channels wherever our guests are present. And finally, each has developed a simple and effective back-end infrastructure to scale quickly without creating complexity. These are just some of the learnings we're able to apply to our home markets, which we expect will follow the path of our more digital international markets over time. That's why we've been focused on ramping up enrollment in our loyalty programs, creating better digital experiences across service modes, including digitizing our drive-thrus, integrating with a growing number of platforms and continuing to improve our back-end infrastructure. We've already seen some early success with the TIM HORTONS app, which now accounts over 10% of Canadians as monthly active users and has the highest usage among restaurant or food delivery apps in the market. While these initiatives take time and investment, especially in our large home markets, they are critical to the future of the business and will continue to be a key priority. With that, I'll hand it back to Jose. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Josh. Turning now to our brand performance. At TIM HORTONS, we're encouraged by the progress we've seen in Canada, including generating 5 points of sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and two-year comparable sales as government restrictions eased throughout July and August, and we continue to execute against our Back to Basics plan. This improvement has come from all provinces with Quebec, Western and Atlantic Canada showing low- to mid-single-digit declines versus 2019 compared to mid- and high-single digits in the second quarter and Ontario improving to high-single-digit declines versus low-teens last quarter. When we look at both restaurant format and urbanity, it's clear where the decline is concentrated. From an urbanity perspective, all urbanities outside of super urban, which represents roughly 10% of our footprint, improved to single-digit declines versus 2019 with rural down low-single digits and suburban and urban down mid-single digits. And while super urban restaurants declined nearly 30%, they did see a 7-point improvement versus the last quarter. And from a format perspective, drive-thru restaurants were nearly flat versus 2019, while non-drive-thrus are still declining in the 20% zip code. That said, non-drive-thru locations did see about a 10-point improvement this quarter versus the second quarter. Despite this positive momentum across regions, formats and urbanities, with reopening plans paused across the vast majority of the country and workplace mobility still significantly behind pre-pandemic levels, we know we're not out of the woods yet, and neither our teams nor our restaurant owners are standing still. We're highly focused on continuing to execute our multi-year Back to Basics plan, which is centered around elevating core quality, innovating for growth and modernizing the brand. The progress we've seen so far from our work has been encouraging. With the exception of hot beverages, all of our product categories are back to pre-pandemic levels or better. And it's also worth mentioning that despite the continued workplace mobility impacts on hot beverage occasions and sales, year-to-date our brewed coffee market share is slightly above pre-pandemic levels. We believe this reflects benefits from the fundamental core quality work we've focused on around fresh brewers, water filtration and our improved dark roast blend. The benefits of this focus on core quality also extend to breakfast, with breakfast foods outperforming pre-pandemic levels despite lapping 2019's very successful two for $5 hot breakfast sandwich promotion. This outperformance has been driven by a boost from the latest addition to our fresh cracked eggs platform, improved breakfast wraps. The team's dedication to innovating for growth is also paying off. As you know, last quarter, we introduced new lines of cold beverages, including our cold brew and Real Fruit Quenchers and we saw them once again contribute positively to two-year comparable sales. We're also pleased to see these items, along with our fresh cracked eggs platform and improved baked goods, helped drive the morning daypart close to 2019 levels. As you know, the morning daypart has historically been a significant percentage of our overall business. So it's encouraging to see progress here even despite workplace mobility constraints. That said, as I mentioned earlier, we're not standing still waiting for mobility to return. We're pushing forward with a strong innovation pipeline to improve our presence in food driven dayparts like lunch and dinner. We've experienced promising results to date in our efforts with Craveables and our new and improved Artisan Sandwiches helping drive lunch ahead of pre-pandemic levels this quarter. And as we move forward in Q4 and into 2022, you'll see us continue to build up the credibility we've been establishing and drive further long-term growth opportunities in food-led dayparts. We're also focused on our commitment to modernization, including building off our strong base of digital known diners and driving guest engagement through our Tims Rewards loyalty program. This quarter, we kicked off our second Roll Up To Win campaign, which helped drive overall monthly known diners to an all-time high. We're particularly excited about this growth as it positions the team to learn more about our guests wants and provide them with even more compelling offers and experiences to drive increases in check, traffic and brand closeness. We're actively working together to further integrate Tims Rewards into our drive-thrus as well, which cover approximately 70% of our system in addition to equipping our drive-thrus with outdoor digital menu boards. We remain on track to complete substantially all of TIM HORTONS North American outdoor digital menu board rollout by the end of this year. And finally, we remain committed to supporting our communities through important efforts like Camp Day and our Smile Cookie campaign. This quarter, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Camp Day, one of the most exciting days of the year for our team and restaurant owners who raised the record-breaking CAD12 million for the TIM HORTONS foundation camps. And in September, franchisees broke another record, this time, for the 25th anniversary of our Smile Cookie campaign raising another CAD12 million for over 600 charities. I'm incredibly grateful to each and every one of our restaurant owners for their contributions, year in and year-out. And I'd like to give a particular shout out to our Dunnville, Ontario restaurant, which sold the most Smile Cookies for the fourth year in a row, selling roughly eight cookies for every resident in Dunnville. We believe our investments in the Back to Basics plan and our community engagement are having a positive impact, not only on our business, but also on our brand health. In fact, we once again saw a year-over-year improvement in brand health metrics across most categories, including food and coffee quality and taste, as well as overall brand connection. We're confident that the work we're doing together with our restaurant owners across our core platforms, product and daypart innovation, brand modernization and community outreach will position Tims well to, not only recapture routines as mobility constraints subside, but also drive new guest, new occasions and new opportunities for the brand in any environment. Turning now to BURGER KING, starting with the US. It's clear we're navigating a transition in the US and this quarter's results reflect that. During the quarter, we saw a 1.6% decline in comparable sales at BURGER KING US, driven primarily by: one, the underperformance of value offerings; and two, our intentional shift away from paper coupons. On value offerings, this quarter's core offers of BOGO plus $1 and two for $6 yielded a considerable year-over-year gap against last year's two for $5, while also facing headwinds from competitor core discount offerings. And on paper coupons, we made a conscious decision to reduce our investment in this declining promotional channel that we've historically over-indexed relative to our peers. We know this decision will impact our results in the near-term, but believe it's the right one as we focus on building more sustainable long-term sales through our digital platforms and by maximizing media firepower behind growing channels with increasingly tailored offering for our guests. Taken together, these items contributed to our third quarter comparable sales decline and with two of our big campaigns during the quarter, Ch'King and Real Meals, unable to offset these headwinds, we saw continued gap relative to our peers. We're keenly aware of this gap and are actively building an actionable long-term plan to address. We know we have an iconic brand with well tenured, focused franchise operators, but we also see clear opportunities across operations, digital, menu and image that can work together to reclaim market share and drive long-term sustainable growth. Executing on these opportunities starts with having the right people and right team in place. As you know, we appointed Tom Curtis as President of BURGER KING US and Canada in August, a proven QSR operator with 35 years' experience as both the franchisee and Senior Executive. Tom has now spent most of the last two months visiting with franchisees across the US and zeroing in on our biggest operations opportunities in addition to gathering feedback on our menu, digital and image programs. What's clear from his initial observations is that, we have a great brand and assets to build from, but we need to double down on putting the guest experience at the center of all of our efforts. Tom and the team have been hard at work in partnership with our franchisees to build a focused plan to reclaim our market share and put us on track for long-term sustainable growth. Well, I'm not going to get into all the detail today, I'll share a few directional highlights on where we're headed. We know that the foundation of any restaurant business is exceptional, repeatable precision in operations. There are upstream impacts on great operations like having a focused menu and creating platforms that can be executed consistently by our team and well design kitchens with modern efficient equipment. There are also important downstream indicators of grid operations, including competitive drive-thru times, order accuracy and product and guest satisfaction scores. Our biggest areas of addressable opportunity are clear and we're already at work on our plans to streamline our operations and drive superior guest service levels. An equally important component is creating an easy and seamless experience for both our team members and guests through digital platforms. We hit an important milestone this quarter with the nationwide in-store rollout of our Royal Perks loyalty program in September, and we've been pleased with the early results with nearly 80% of registered digital guests now having converted to Royal Perks. We're also actively working to integrate loyalty offers into our outdoor digital menu boards which we continue to install across North America. We now have over 50% of BURGER KING drive-thru restaurants equipped with outdoor digital menu boards and expect to exit 2021 with about 75% complete, nearing to 100% milestone by mid-2022. With nearly 80% of BURGER KING sales coming from drive-thru, we believe this important initiative will drive significant long-term benefits for the overall business. Turning to our menu. We know we have the most loved QSR hamburger in America. All our data shows our flame-grilled Whopper outperforms the hero product of our competitors, yet many of our burger promotions for the last few years have focused on sub-brands or extensions to our core rather than doubling down on our flagship hero products. More to come in our burger category strategy, but there is no doubt that the Whopper is very important to our long-term plans. On chicken, despite the modest initial performance of Ch'King, we continue to believe in the platform. It's a great chicken sandwich and an important part of our core menu, but there is work to be done to build a platform to its full potential, including improving our communications, market positioning and pricing. We also view breakfast as one of the most incremental menu and daypart opportunities for the brand. We have a sizable existing breakfast business driven by Ch'Sandwich [Phonetic], but we see runway to expand by developing the menu offering at various price points, serving a good cup of coffee, leveraging our technology to nail speed of service and accuracy and deliver a more consistent and reliable experience and having a more thoughtful consistent marketing and media investment plan. On value, you've heard me talk about the importance of every day value and getting the mechanics right. For years, we've been spreading ourselves too thin across too many messages with mixed results. In fact, historically, we've consistently had the most value constructs in the market, 3 times as many as our lead competitors, which diluted our marketing firepower and added to operational complexity. It also confused guests. Our ongoing investments in data and analytics have given us a much clearer view of the media weight required to have both promotional and every day value offers, drive guest visits and we're already working to address by focusing our efforts behind fewer, more impactful offers and value platforms. We're also thoughtfully developing a roadmap for image transformation of our restaurant portfolio. Our digital initiatives go hand-in-hand with this priority. We're closely examining ways to optimize the sales potential of our portfolio while maximizing the ROI for each franchisee. For example, in certain markets, the highest return on investment for a franchisee may be investing in our double drive-thrus rather than extensive in-store dining room redesign. Each market, each store and each partner is unique and to that end, we're working with our franchisees to align on a more ambitious image transformation plan for the future. And finally, this brings us to the most important piece of driving long-term success. Franchisee profitability, trust and engagement. We can have a great strategy in place, but at the end of the day, the key to success will be how well we work together with our franchisees to execute the plan in their restaurants. Fortunately, Tom's candor and humility, his intense focus on simplification, guest experience and profitability and his track record of success as a former franchisee, in addition to the time he and the BURGER KING team have spent with franchisees on the road so far has resulted in early support from our franchisees. As we look ahead, Q4 is all about finalizing and engaging the franchise system on the multi-year plan. And 2022 will be focused on implementing year one of that plan. We recognize that important long-term value creating change does not happen overnight. We're confident in our BURGER KING leadership, our brand, our team and our incredible franchisees and their teams, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarters. Turning for a moment to international, a bright spot for the BURGER KING brand and a key driver of our long-term growth. As Josh highlighted, BURGER KING has a strong and growing presence internationally, generating about 60% of the brand systemwide sales up from roughly 45% in 2012. The brand has incredible global awareness and is improving its market positioning, including in Spain, which generates over $1 billion in systemwide sales and recently hit an exciting milestone of becoming the most preferred QSR brand in the country. During the third quarter, BURGER KING's international business grew systemwide sales over 10% versus 2019, an acceleration from last quarter's 3% growth. This performance included sequential two-year comparable sales improvements in some of our largest markets: France, Spain, Germany and Brazil, with France notably returning to pre-pandemic levels during the quarter and Germany generating nearly double-digit comparable sales growth versus 2019. And we saw a double-digit comparable sales versus 2019 in key markets, including Australia, the UK, Russia, South Korea and Japan. Given the diversity of our international business, it's difficult to pinpoint one or two key drivers of the overall comparable sales growth in the quarter. That said, we've noted a few highlights that we believe are contributing to growth in certain markets. For example, our plant-based products have proved to be an important sales driver in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands and continue to grow as we launch new products. Our digital sales have also notably improved with the international business now generating roughly 50% of sales from digital channels. We're pleased with the progress we continue to make internationally at BURGER KING and as restrictions continue to ease, we're optimistic we'll continue to see a rebound in sales, that coupled with a robust development pipeline, we expect will drive long-term sustainable growth for the brand for years to come. Let's now turn to POPEYES. As Josh highlighted, we see a significant long-term growth opportunity for the POPEYES brand. This quarter, we grew two-year comparable sales nearly 15%, even despite lapping the August 2019 launch of our game-changing chicken sandwich. That said, on a year-over-year basis, US comparable sales declined 4.5%, primarily driven by traffic declines and, to a lesser extent, less effective impacts from the offers we had in the market. On traffic, ongoing labor challenges led to reduced service modes and operating hours, particularly in late-night, as well as the temporary distribution center interruption in the Northeast. We're focused on working with our franchisees to alleviate the impact of these challenges in the future. And while in-restaurant staffing may take time to improve, we're well into the process of further diversifying our distribution network in the region to mitigate the impact of any future distribution center disruptions on our supply chain. Despite these headwinds, which drove the majority of the year-over-year decline, the brand continues to generate over $1.8 million in annualized sales per restaurant in the US. And POPEYES US once again grew systemwide sales as success from the team's focus on strong development offset the decline in comparable sales. The team also remains committed to making progress across menu innovation and during the third quarter, focused on two areas: nuggets and premium beverages. We launched nuggets in July, adding a new long-term category to our menu and a convenient way to enjoy our delicious hand-breaded Louisiana chicken. While the launch of nuggets has proved to be incremental to our business, attracting new guests and driving check, it was unable to offset the traffic headwinds we experienced during the quarter and we know there is more we can do to enhance the performance of this important new category for us. For example, we know every great nugget deserves a great sauce pairing. So we're focused on innovating in this key area, introducing creative and delicious new sauces, like our recently launched Hottie Sauce. Yes, you heard it right in collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion. We're particularly excited about this collaboration as it, not only introduces the new dipping sauce for our nuggets, but also innovates on our iconic chicken sandwich platform for the first-time. On premium beverages, our recently launched lemonade platform drove beverage incidence to their highest level since 2017. Beverages are a great driver of traffic and franchise profitability, and we think there's even more we can do here and are excited to keep building on the momentum that we've seen. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for the POPEYES brand as we continue to innovate across our menu and dayparts, enhance the guest experience and bring POPEYES to more guest around the US, and the world with a robust development pipeline. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Matt to take you through our financial and cash flow results for the quarter. Matt? Matthew Dunnigan -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Jose, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, we made solid progress against many of our key priorities and our results once again demonstrate the benefit of having a diversified and resilient business model. For the third quarter, our global systemwide sales grew 11% to $9.4 billion and our adjusted EBITDA was up about 5% organically year-over-year to $607 million, while historically, our growth in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year has been closer to our systemwide sales growth, there were a couple of factors that contributed to the difference in our consolidated growth rates this quarter. First, as we've highlighted on past calls, our continued proactive investments in people, digital and technology has led to a sizable year-over-year increase in segment G&A. We expect that our core segment G&A will sequentially increased roughly $5 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter with fourth quarter levels establishing a reasonable baseline as we head into 2022. Additionally, our year-over-year growth this quarter reflects the fact that advertising expenses exceeded revenues by approximately $12 million more than they did in the third quarter of last year, resulting in an impact of negative 2 points to our EBITDA growth. This mostly reflects spending from our CAD80 million commitment behind the TIM HORTONS' Canada ad fund, supporting our Back to Basics initiatives. And as of the end of Q3, we have deployed nearly 75% of these funds and expect to spend the remainder during Q4. Before turning to EPS, I'd like to quickly discuss two items that we know are top of mind. First, our supply chain business at Tims in light of the current macroeconomic environment. And second, how to think about the impact of our robust international growth on our business. On supply chain, as you've heard from our peers and others outside our industry, we're seeing increased levels of inflation on the commodities and labor front. So we thought it would be helpful to include a brief update on our supply chain business at Tims. With sales beginning to recover this year in Canada, we've seen margins bounce back relative to 2020 and hold a pretty consistent level on a year-to-date basis. We've been very encouraged to see this improvement. However, given the most recent market trends, we do expect margins to moderate slightly over the next couple of quarters as we navigate through this elevated volatility, monitor and adjust our pricing as appropriate, and ensure strong operations and service levels, all while keeping both our guests and our franchisees in mind as always. On our international growth, you heard Jose and Josh mentioned the strong progress we've made restarting our global growth engine this year, and the exciting opportunities we have to accelerate toward our 40,000 restaurant target. We see significant runway to continue scaling our international businesses, which are already strong contributors to our results, generating over 40% of our consolidated global systemwide sales. As a reminder, our international franchise partners typically localized supply chains and control their own real estate portfolios. Therefore, as we continue to rapidly expand in international markets, our primary source of incremental income will come from high-quality franchising revenues with royalties tied to systemwide sales growth. Now, turning to EPS. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.76 compared to $0.68 last year, representing a nominal increase of approximately 12%. Included in this increase is an FX tailwind of about 3%. The higher growth compared to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% year-over-year was mainly driven by lower net interest expense, and a reduced share count from our repurchase activity, partially offset by higher adjusted effective tax rate and higher equity-based compensation. It's worth highlighting that equity-based compensation increased quarter-over-quarter to $25 million in Q3. Given the continued investments we've been making in our people throughout the year, we do expect this to ramp up a bit more in Q4. Turning to our capital structure, we manage a highly efficient and scalable business model with recurring and diversified income streams and strong conversion to cash flow. During the quarter, we generated nearly $490 million of free cash flow, enabling us to reinvest in our business while also following through on our commitment to return capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As Jose mentioned, we've been actively buying back shares, utilizing our enhanced capital allocation flexibility from our $1 billion open market share repurchase authorization. During Q3, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.8 million shares of our common stock for over $180 million, leaving us with over $800 million still available under our current program. On October 5, we also returned approximately $245 million to our shareholders through a $0.53 per share quarterly dividend and we recently declared an additional dividend of $0.53 per common share and unit payable on January 5, 2022, consistent with our previously announced target of $2.12 per share for 2021. Even with combined capital returns of over $425 million in the quarter, we also saw our net leverage declined further to 5.2 times. In addition, from a liquidity perspective, we continued to maintain very strong flexibility between our nearly $1.8 billion of cash and our $1 billion revolver, we have about $2.8 billion available to us. Looking ahead, our capital allocation priorities remain very consistent, prudently maintain an efficient capital structure, invest back in the business through high impact organic opportunities, continue returning significant capital to shareholders through dividends and our expanded open market authorization and evaluate accretive strategic opportunities. With that, I'd like to thank everyone again for your support and for joining us this morning. And we'll now open the line for questions. Operator? Questions and Answers: Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Chris Carril from RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Christopher Carril -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi. Good morning and thanks for the question. So, on Tims Canada, I appreciate all the commentary around regional and urban trends. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the other factors driving performance in Canada? Perhaps any insights on what the competitive environment has been like as mobility has improved? And curious about drive-thru trends. I think you noted that drive-thrus were flat in the quarter. If I did hear that correctly, what do you see pushing drive-thru trends into positive territory? Thanks. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Hey, Chris, thanks so much for the question. Yeah. If I may, I'm going to go into a little bit here because you asked a number of different components of Tims Canada performance. So, as you probably recall, last time we were together was in late July and as of end of July, reopening was well underway in Canada and there was a lot of -- there was some momentum in the market in terms of reopening, big banks and other large employers in Toronto were expected to return to the -- to offices in Q4, and this was at the beginning when we start to see some impact from the Delta variant, just making some noise. When you fast forward to the end of the summer, cases started to rise pretty significantly throughout August and reopening was paused and we saw the vaccine mandates implemented and mask mandates reintroduced, which put further pressure on mobility and reopening, which, as we all know, has lagged in Canada versus the US and we've seen urban centers continue to take cautionary approaches. And Downtown Toronto, as an example, is still not back to work in urbanity remains the biggest drag in our business in Canada. Many of the large employers have pushed back returns to office to sometime in 2022. In the quarter, we saw a nice improvement in July and maintain that in August and September and we exited September similar to July, and there has been no real material shift in trends to call out in October versus where we were in Q3. So really that's where we stand today. There is a clear concentrated drag from urban and super urban locations in our business there. And this is we're lagging workplace mobility most impacts our business where we have high frequency, relatively low check guests. The guest buys that coffee or two coffees on the way to work. All that said, despite these pressures from a mobility standpoint, we're improving quarter-to-quarter and getting back to where we were in 2019. For example, even with a drag in workplace mobility, we've gotten morning daypart to close to flat, driven by our emphasis on quality enhancements in our breakfast foods and we're seeing sequential improvement in hot beverage. In other words, we're reducing the drag that that we've seen over the last 18 months. And we see a really strong opportunity to continue to grow even if mobility doesn't come back fully. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're not waiting around. We're protecting and enhancing the core offering while pursuing new opportunities in food dayparts like lunch and dinner, important dayparts that, obviously, are critical to the industry. In Canada as an example, 60% of overall industry sales are in those dayparts and we were about 35%. So we under-index there and we think it's a unique opportunity to increase share as we continue to develop offerings and build off strong performance like Craveables and we're encouraged by these early results in lunch, which is why we're continuing to push on that and we've built on it during the fall with our freshly grilled wraps. Probably the daypart that has the biggest opportunity is dinner, which is still behind pre-pandemic levels, down a bit there and -- but as we look at the offerings that we're developing with Artisan Sandwiches, and the wraps and others, we think there is a path to get back to pre-pandemic levels and then growing from there, which is an exciting long-term opportunity for the business. Where we think we need to focus on, as I mentioned is, to succeed in lunch and dinner, we need to drive food and beverage offerings that makes sense and pair well with food during those dayparts, which is what led to some of the innovation in cold beverage, supporting our new food platforms as well all year long. So kind of summarizing where we are from a daypart perspective, two-year sales outside of dinner and late-night are roughly flat to above where we were in 2019. And one of the important data points is, given the pandemic and the impact on the business, we had been working with our franchise partners and owners in Canada reducing and in some cases, closing late-night in order to address the reduced mobility and the market throughout the pandemic. And we are now just in Q4 beginning to reopen later night hours for a big component of the Tim Canada system. I think as it relates to drive-thru, you mentioned that, we saw, obviously, a pretty significant growth in drive-thru during COVID. Drive-thru is an important channel. We have about 2,600 plus locations in Canada, which is more than a 1,000 than any of our closest competitor. And we've seen that morning daypart roughly flat, as I mentioned to 2019 levels at drive-thru enabled locations, morning is outperforming pre-pandemic levels on average, which shows the overall long-term value of drive-thrus, which is one of the reasons why we have invested significantly in our drive-thrus to modernize our experience with outdoor digital menu boards and loyalty integrations which are taking place as we speak. I think investments -- the other piece, I'd highlight here is that, investments in our digital capabilities are really continuing to add to the experience and to the sales in the business in Canada. We've got the number one QSR app in Canada. Tims Rewards is driving traffic, check and beginning to contribute to sales and that strong relationship with our guests is allowing us to engage them and drive more frequency and check as well. And then the final comment I'd make is on the ad fund contributions that I mentioned back at the beginning of the year. We had mentioned CAD80 million contribution. We're probably about three quarters of the way through that contribution in 2021. And just as a reminder, franchisees will, on an ongoing basis, increased their contribution to the advertising fund by 50 basis points. We're confident in the plan that we have. We're encouraged by the progress we're making so far. We've seen improvements in addition to the sales and daypart and format improvements that I mentioned, we've also seen improvements in our brand health metrics, including brand connection. So, obviously, lots of work to do, but we're encouraged by the progress we're making and look forward to keeping you posted on how we evolve. Thanks very much. Christopher Carril -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Dennis Geiger -- UBS -- Analyst Great. Thanks for the question. Jose, I wanted to ask a bit about some of the key pressures impacting franchisees and really the industry in particular in recent months, I guess, across brands, be it staffing issues, labor pressures, commodity pressures, etc. What kind of impact are the franchisees in the system broadly seeing from these pressures? How the system managing these pressures and kind of thinking about managing them going forward? I know you spoke to some of this with the POPEYES DC issue and the TIM HORTONS supply chain. But even more broadly, curious the impacts. And then just as it relates to potential implications that you could speak to making from these impacts, be it, demand -- new open demand in any way, potential franchise or investment support, anything just on the go-forward as we think about the environment right now? Thank you. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer All right. Thanks, Dennis. I'll take the labor impacts. I think the broad -- broadly speaking, and I'll pass it over to Matt to touch a little bit more on kind of broadly speaking inflation impacts in the business and then I'll wrap it up on your three-part, one question, I'll wrap it up on the development front and what impact we're seeing on that end. But as I called -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, labor challenges are impacting the entire industry and not just the restaurant industry, but broadly speaking, and through retail and other businesses as well, shipping, etc. We called out the impact specifically at POPEYES because it was where we felt it most acutely. We saw it in the context of reduced operating hours and service modes, especially around late-night. And we also saw some impacts in our distribution centers, in particular in the Northeast. On operating hours, we saw about an average of one hour reduction in operating hours at POPEYES during this quarter relative to pre-pandemic levels, which obviously, has an impact and that was disproportionately impacting our late-night business, which historically over indexes in family and which comes along with a pretty high check. Outside of late-night, we saw daily sales improving in either flat or improving modestly throughout the quarter so that the real drag and real impact from a labor standpoint was late-night daypart. And on service modes, we're seeing nearly 40% of the system operating with reduced service modes either drive-thru delivery and take out-only or drive-thru and delivery-only, which means our dining rooms are generally have been closed in many cases because of some of these staffing challenges that we're facing that are kind of near-term challenges for the system. And then on the DC side, we saw an impact of roughly 10% of the stores with this Northeast distribution center disruption. And one of the things that our team, alongside our purchasing cooperative for POPEYES has been doing -- purchasing and distribution cooperative, they've been working on diversifying the distribution network, and we expect to complete that transition later this quarter. I think this is a challenge that all brands here in North America are facing. But as I mentioned at the beginning of my response here, it's a challenge that's been felt most acutely with the POPEYES business in the US and something we're working closely with our franchise partners to address we've created -- working teams to address -- to share best practices. There is some really good operators that have done amazing work already in creating job fairs and pipelines of folks coming into the restaurants and staffing up well. So we're sharing those practices and we're also leveraging technology and streamlining operations wherever possible to make this transition in this challenging moment would be more kind of be friendlier to operations to allow for staffing levels to get to the places we need them to get to drive growth in the business. And with that, I'll pass it over to Matt to touch on some of the other impacts that we're seeing in the near-term. Matthew Dunnigan -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Thanks, Jose. Hey, Dennis. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I think as it relates to inflation, I think we're fortunate to have come out of 2020, generally speaking, across our brands with strong profitability. That said, Jose touched on, I think there is headwinds for us to work through in staffing, the wages and general inflation. And so, the approach we've taken is to work side-by-side with our franchisees to address as best we can, and manage through this tougher cost environment. I'd say, pricing is definitely in the conversation. We've taken pricing this year generally in line with inflation in the US and we'll continue to take a really hard look at where we go from here moving forward. On mix, we can and have looked at low-margin, low traffic items with franchisees. And in addition to that, on the commodity front, I think, I would say that, procurement is a really big focus for us. We think that scale is an important advantage. When you consider sourcing of different products around the world, across the brands and we think our system benefits from that in terms of our scale with each of the three brands. And on the labor front, we're looking at ways we can simplify life in the restaurants, looking at processes, looking at simplifying the menu. And so, we think there is a number of things that we're working on here to address the pressure that we're seeing with our franchisees. But overall, the number one thing we can do we think is to drive traffic and address our guests needs and drive sales. Maybe the other -- just really quickly, the other point I would touch on is the comments I made about the TIM HORTONS supply chain. I'd say that we're encouraged by the progress that we've seen in the Tims Canada business in terms of our sales recovery, in terms of our margin improvements year-over-year versus 2020. Historically, we haven't given guidance on margins. However, given the recent volatility around inflation that we've seen, we thought some directional color would be helpful. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect margins to moderate slightly from where we were in Q3. We have some time to go here in Q4, but based on what we see currently, we think the margin impact directionally could look like approximately 50 basis points versus the Q3 levels. And, of course, we'll be managing very closely across all fronts over the next few months to navigate through the environment here. So, I'll pass it back to Jose on development. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And I'm -- thanks, Matt. And on development, obviously, this constraints in certain markets related to labor and supply chain, but we've got a really strong network of equipment suppliers where our teams are working closely with them, our franchisees are as well. And we expect, as we've said several times over the last quarters, we are excited about the pipeline. We're encouraged by the progress we're making. We think we're going to be at or near levels of 2018, 2019 unit growth in 2021 and we're confident we can accelerate in the years to come with the quality of the partners that we have, the amazing whitespace that exist around the world and even here in the US and Canada. And look forward to updating you on that progress in the coming quarters. Thanks so much. Dennis Geiger -- UBS -- Analyst Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. John Glass -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you and good morning. Jose, on BURGER KING US, two questions. One, specifically, what's the impact of removing the paper coupons if there's a way to sort of isolate that so we understand that impact? And then more broadly, you outlined a number of pieces that you want to work on and had to do with menu and the brand and maybe even some equipment. What are the couple of things that we should watch over the next couple of quarters? What are the immediate action steps that might be able to bend the trend or should we think about this as a longer-term project such that none of these probably impact near-term, but are all good longer-term? Thanks. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, John. On paper coupons, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we tend -- historically, BURGER KING in the US over-indexes in paper coupons relative to peers, something in the neighborhood of 3 times the number of coupons compared to most of our peers. It's been traditionally an important channel, but the effectiveness has eroded a bit over time, especially with the younger consumers. And so, we felt and we do feel it makes sense the transition, media allocation and kind of the focus to other consumer-facing channels that we believe over time will generate higher return. Ideally compensating by finding new long-term sustainable platforms, especially as it relates to digital. And this is what Royal Perks is designed to do, shifting our digital media or digital offers with -- to known diners, helping us engage them better and drive guest behavior and ultimately, build a strong base with the younger generation. As it relates to the impact, we haven't kind of communicated the details of that, but it -- we believe we'll be able to shift very quickly with the growing Royal Perks platform that we have and some of our digital offers that are available. We believe we'll be able to shift to a much more accretive digital coupon and digital engagement program over time. Now, as it relates to the BURGER KING plan overall, as I mentioned last quarter and mentioned in my prepared remarks, the key was focused pace and building our team. We saw that we had done some good work with BURGER KING in the US on -- from time-to-time, but we haven't -- had been consistent. And so, we tap Tom and I mentioned that in recent communications, we tap Tom to lead the BK US business, working with franchisees now and building his team and bringing in more disciplined and analytical rigor and focus to the business. The focus now is working through the details of the framework in the plan, which I laid out in -- with some broad headlines, operations, digital, menu work and image. I think the big -- they're all big areas to work on and these are plans and initiatives that we're developing in partnership with our franchise system in the US. We don't see -- we don't have a timeline on this. The most important thing is that, we do the right work with our franchisees. I think the big element of the plan for the US is around execution and being much more consistent on that front. We've been working on and Tom's brought a lot of discipline around simplification of the menu, building standardization, bringing some equipment, changes in the back of house to help with accuracy. We've also started to -- throughout the year, we've been making investments in our field organization, which we believe will be a key part to drive the business forward in partnership with our franchisees. Digital remains a big opportunity for the BK System. We've already started to put in place the -- obviously, the app has been in place for a while, Royal Perks on loyalty, the ability to personalized offers and drive behavior with our CRM and outdoor digital menu boards making the experience in the drive-thru much more digital and much more personalized. On the menu front, being able to focus on some of these core platforms in burger chicken and value, as I've touched on in my prepared remarks and really moving away from promotional in and out and kind of -- which dilutes the message and dilutes our advertising firepower, allowing us to really drive growth in kind of the core of our business. I mentioned before and touched on briefly the importance of breakfast and that being a long-term driver of growth in that daypart. And then finally, on the image front, being able to continue the work we're doing on drive-thru and enhancing that experience. And then also working with our partners, our franchise partners to drive an acceleration of the renovations where the opportunity to drive growth and good returns exist best. Q3 was a transition. Q4 is where we're launching our multi-year plan and 2022 is year one of execution and we're excited about the work we're doing and we're excited about the engagement we have with the franchise system and we'll keep you posted on our progress there. John Glass -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thank you. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Jon Tower -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Great. I think you answered much of my last question, but just in terms of following up on the BK US, would you pull up similar lever potentially as you did with TIM HORTONS in Canada and use some of the Restaurant Brands capital to pour into the marketing programs of BK US assuming the franchisees are aligned with that sort of message? Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Jon, thanks for the question. Look, I think the first level of investment that we've been making is building out a strong leadership team and we've been doing that now at BURGER KING, similar to what we did at TIM HORTONS and we've added -- obviously, Tom has been named to run the business. We've bolstered a team with an industry veteran in data science and analytics. We've brought in a culinary lead, as well as a chef to drive the BK innovation. These are critical roles to ensure we have the interest of our guests front and center, as well as those of our franchisees. And as I mentioned, in response to the earlier question, we've increased presence and coverage in the field, which we think is critical here. On the capital front, we already invest in the business from a remodel standpoint here in the US and we, obviously, are working in the early days on how we can accelerate that in partnership with the franchise system. And as it relates to the ad fund, we're early days here on building out the BK US plan. And the most important thing is to have a solid plan that our franchisees support and can drive traffic and sales and we'll continue to use the same discipline that we've had from a capital allocation standpoint to drive the most significant impact on the business and ultimately, the biggest impact long-term on shareholder returns. Thanks so much for the question. Operator Our next question comes from Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Mullan -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thank you. A question on Tims, you shared a stat that 10% of Canadians are now monthly active users in the loyalty program, that's encouraging to hear. Just big picture, do you think you're now at a place with the program where its ready to be a meaningful transaction sales driver when the Canadian economy is truly and fully reopening -- reopened? And if yes, is there a scenario where the benefits could prove to be multi-year in nature? Just any thoughts on your degree of optimism here as the country emerges from COVID would be helpful to hear. Joshua Kobza -- Chief Operating Officer Yeah, Brian, it's Josh, and thanks for the question. As we -- as you mentioned a bit earlier and I think you mentioned a moment ago, we've been really pleased with the work that the Tims team has done on the mobile app and more broadly, on the Tims Rewards program. And we launched it a couple of years ago and it's evolved in a really positive way that I think has led so many of our guests and so many Canadians to want to engage with it. I think we're really excited about how many monthly active users we have, but also about the kind of the frequency with which people engage with the app. It's not just that they use it once a month. But they use it, in most cases, many times a week. And I think that level of engagement in a mobile app is something that's really special kind of anywhere in the restaurant world. So we think we have something really great there. I think the team has built that by creating a really seamless experience at the restaurant, but also through creating other exciting avenues for engagement by making things like contests, such as Roll Up to Win, fully digital taking really bold steps and executing them really well and making those experiences really positive. So, we're really pleased with it. We think it is an exciting avenue to be able to drive greater engagement with the brand and ultimately, drive sales over the medium- to long-term. And we see it as a big asset for the business and something that we're very excited about the prospects for -- over the long-term. Brian Mullan -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Lauren Silberman -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Thank you for the question. I appreciate all the commentary on the development. TIM HORTONS international another nice quarter of unit growth. You've talked about the significant opportunity in China. What have you learned about expanding internationally with TIM HORTONS China that you can leverage to in other international markets? And then how are you thinking about the development opportunities for TIM HORTONS in Canada? Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Lauren, thanks for the question. Yeah. We've given some color over the last few quarters on Tims China, which we're excited about. I think the most important piece is the great work that the team there has done to build a business and a brand and a product offering, that really connects and engages with the consumers in China. The digital offering is pretty exciting and has done a great job of engaging consumers in-store and also from a pre-order and payment standpoint. What gives us confidence in the opportunity in China and more broadly, globally outside of Canada is the fact that our beverages connect well and really travel well across many markets. We've seen that the expanded beverage offering, including cold beverages and specialty beverages worked really well. And then we work closely with our partners to localize the food offering to make it relevant for our consumers there. We've seen some progress actually heading out to Mexico later today to go visit our TIM HORTONS business in Monterrey, Mexico, which is growing and performing well. We've got a great business in -- for Tims in the UK with a very different offering than what we see in China, it's drive-thrus, it's very similar in terms of scale at the restaurant and offering to what we see in our Canadian business. So there is a lot of exciting opportunities there. And we believe that we're just at the beginning of the journey internationally for Tims. Coffee is a fast-growing segment internationally, especially Asia, but also in Europe and other markets around the globe. We've got a great coffee offering. We've got a strong heritage with TIM HORTONS, and our price points are really accessible. So, we're -- and our digital capabilities are growing and really helping engage our consumers there. So we're excited about the growth prospects there. As it relates to Tims in Canada, we obviously, have a strong presence all around. There are certain parts of the country where we think we have quite a bit of room for growth. We think continuing to expand our drive-thru capabilities in certain areas is a good opportunity for development and we'll continue to infill and optimize the portfolio where we think we can provide better service and better accessibility to our guests using our digital platforms, or drive-thru platform and other off-premise and kind of convenient way to connect with the brand. Thanks so much of the question. I think Josh has one more comment on this. Joshua Kobza -- Chief Operating Officer Yeah. Lauren, if I can just add one or two things to what Jose said on the international side. I think one of the great things that David and the international team have done with TIM HORTONS business across the globe is they figured out how to adapt the business to each of the markets in a unique way, whether that's formats that are a little bit larger format drive-thru in places like the UK or some smaller formats but very drive-thru oriented in Mexico or the formats that we have in China, but the thing that's -- or the Middle East for that matter. The thing that's common across those is that, we've been able to achieve some really remarkable payback period across all of those geographies. And I think that's what has our international team getting more and more excited about TIM HORTONS and our ability to adapt it and create a really compelling investment proposition for franchisees all across the globe with the brand. So I think our team has done a really wonderful job with that and we're all pretty pleased with it. Lauren Silberman -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great. Thank you, guys. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, our final question for this morning comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. David Palmer -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in and great detail on the call. Two quick ones. Could you touch on the percentage of dining rooms closed or hours of operation reduction that you're seeing for BURGER KING US and Tims Canada? Any numbers would be helpful. Obviously, those will hopefully get reopened and those hours restored. And then it was good to see the two-year acceleration for BURGER KING international, where was the greatest improvement as you look around the world? Thanks. Jose Cil -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, David. On the dining rooms closed and hours of operation, it's pretty -- it's been volatile, especially with POPEYES. We've seen a little bit of that happening as well with BURGER KING and Tims. So the numbers in terms of dining rooms closed kind of fluctuates a bit given the circumstances. In certain markets, we've seen vaccination requirements take hold. And so, that's impacted as well our dining room business. But overall, as I mentioned with POPEYES, we've seen some impacts -- some significant impacts in late-night mostly and dinner dayparts from the labor shortages and some of the staffing challenges that we faced. And as it relates to BURGER KING international, we're very excited about the progress we made, especially in this quarter relative to last year and to 2019, where we've seen the progress is pretty widespread. And that's what's exciting about the opportunity in our business there and the work that the team is doing with our master franchisees. Thanks, again, for the question, David, and for everyone else. And thanks for joining us this morning. We've made quite a bit of progress executing on a number of our key priorities, including accelerating our development pipeline. And we also know there's more work to be done to accelerate our growth and drive our brands to their full potential. I'm incredibly grateful to our team and our franchisees for their hard work day in and day out. They remain focused on elevating the guest experience, accelerating our restaurant development and driving long-term sustainable growth for our business and our shareholders. Thank you, again, for joining us, and have a great day.

Its web site currently offers dozens of available jobs in sales, data & analytics, engineering and human resources listed in Newport, Ky., but with the change in HQ, those jobs are likely to relocate to Cincinnati.The relocation means the Cincinnati Center City Development Corp. has now filled more than 90% of the available office space in the former Fountain Place building, which 3CDC spent $51 million renovating after Macy’s closed in 2018.Turner Construction and Deloitte claimed all but 21,000 square feet of the building's available office space in previously announced deals.“The addition of Divisions Maintenance Group to The Foundry development is a significant step for the project, Cincinnati’s urban core and the city as a whole,” 3CDC CEO Steve Leeper said in a prepared statement. “Divisions is a burgeoning company who will help fuel downtown’s overall growth. As the center city continues to recover from the challenges of the past 18 months, the introduction of another exceptional company as a tenant to this critical project shows the urban core is continuing to move forward and is poised to be stronger than ever in the future.”The Ohio Tax Credit Authority awarded a 10-year tax credit worth up to $5 million to encourage the creation of 256 full-time equivalent jobs to Ohio. Those new jobs would bring $25.6 million in new annual payroll to Cincinnati, which is an average of $100,000 per job.“We’re glad that the Cincinnati region will retain Divisions Maintenance Group,” said Northern Kentucky Tri-ED CEO Lee Crume. “We know that the company took the decision of where to expand seriously and explored several options – in the end this is a business decision. 2021 has been a successful year in Northern Kentucky with a diverse array of companies locating and expanding here and there is great momentum in new projects heading into the end of the year.”",

[+] Los Angeles Lakers on October 19, 2021 at STAPLES Center in Los Angeles. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images). Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Almost seven days ago, Adele’s new single “Easy on Me” debuted on the Hot 100 much lower than most people expected, but it turned out to be just the beginning for the cut. Now that a full tracking frame has passed for the tune, it bolts to No. 1 on the Hot 100, giving the singer another leader on the most competitive songs ranking in the U.S. “Easy on Me” jumps to No. 1 with 74,000 pure purchases, nearly 54 million streams on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube and 65 impressions at radio across the country. Many predicted that “Easy on Me” would debut on the Hot 100 at No. 1, giving the superstar her second instant ruler, but that didn’t end up being the case. Adele released her new single with a few hours left in a tracking frame, and it was so highly-anticipated, the masses didn’t wait to consume the latest from the powerhouse vocalist. In just five hours, “Easy on Me” racked up enough streams, sales and radio play to debut on the Hot 100 at No. 68. The tune managed to become the fourth-bestselling in America with just a few hours of availability, which speaks to her incredible and unprecedented popularity. MORE FROM FORBES Why Is Adele's New Single 'Easy On Me' So Low On The Hot 100? By Hugh McIntyre The smash quickly becomes Adele’s fifth No. 1 on the Hot 100 and her first in as many years. She first ruled the ranking in mid-2011 with “Rolling in the Deep,” the song that turned the singer from a rising talent to watch to a household name all around the world. Featured on her album 21 , two more singles from that project also worked their way to the summit, with both “Someone Like You” and “Set Fire to the Rain” spending time on the throne. As she began promoting her most recent full-length 25 , she debuted its lead cut “Hello” in first place back in the fall of 2015.

Like the song that preceded it, the title is easily one of the most highly-anticipated of 2021, and it will surely go right to the top of the Billboard 200 when it arrives, bringing the Grammy and Oscar winner back to the highest tier once again.

Otis Worldwide Corp ( NYSE:OTIS ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 8:30 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good morning and welcome to Otis' Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being carried live on the Internet and recorded for replay. Presentation materials are available for download at Otis' website at www.otis.com. I will now turn over to Michael Rednor, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Michael Rednor -- Senior Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Michelle. Welcome to Otis' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant non-recurring items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mike, and thank you everyone for joining us. We hope that everyone listening is safe and well. Otis continue to make significant progress driving our long-term strategic priorities as reflected in the strong financial performance year-to-date. In the third quarter, we grew organic sales and expanded margins in both segments. We gained approximately 1.5 points of New Equipment share this quarter and year-to-date, on top of 60 basis points in the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, New Equipment orders were up mid-teens with growth in all regions, reflecting our continued focus on providing value for our customers and a recovery in our end markets throughout the year. In the quarter, New Equipment orders were particularly strong in Asia, up mid-teens where we secured an order for the Hong Kong International Airport extending an over 20-year relationship with this customer. We will install over 100 escalators and moving walkways to keep passengers moving across the concourse. This is further progress of our sub-strategy to win in infrastructure. In China, we're seeing traction on our new Gen3 connected elevators, reaffirming our investment in the innovation that Otis ONE provides to our customers and passengers. Just a few months after officially launching our Gen3 elevator, we secured our first repeat customer in China for the new platform. Jilin Longchang Property Developer Company ordered an additional 123 Gen3 elevator systems for four more commercial and residential projects in Northeast China. We're also making progress on deploying our Gen360 connected elevator platform in EMEA. In the first few months after launch, we received several Gen360 awards, adding more than 50% to the pilot phase volumes. Moving to Service. In the quarter, we grew our industry-leading maintenance portfolio by 3%; a goal we set for ourselves entering the year and grew organic Service sales for the third consecutive quarter. In the Americas, Otis was selected to continue a 35-year partnership with One Commerce Square in downtown Philadelphia. Otis installed the building's original elevators in the 1980s and has been maintaining the unit since then. Otis will now modernize the building's elevators, including the introduction of our Compass 360 destination dispatching system. Our own portfolio modernization awards are a testament to Otis service excellence and long-standing customer relationships. The strong year-to-date company performance and robust cash flow generation in excess of 140% of net income enabled us to complete $725 million in share repurchases. In September, we announced a tender offer for the remaining interest in Zardoya Otis, a premier elevator business in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, with a strong service presence. The transaction will simplify our corporate structure and operations, while optimizing alignment of assets and debt financing in Europe. We expect this transaction to be mid-single-digit percentage accretive in 2023. In parallel with this strong financial performance, we made additional progress on our ESG initiatives. Focusing on sustainability has always been an integral part of our operations culture and achieving ISO 14001 certification for all of our factories is an important part of our existing efforts. We're pleased that this quarter we achieved this goal, years ahead of schedule, adding our factories in Korea and Florence, South Carolina. We're proud to see several programs recognized at these two factories, including power consumption reduction programs, robust package recycling processes and lubricant leakage prevention measures. In addition, in Florence, we launched a pilot for zero-waste-to-landfill program that will scale to other manufacturing sites next year as we work toward our goal of having all factories eligible for a zero-waste-to-landfill certification by 2025. We also made progress on our social initiatives, launching the second year of our Made to Move Communities signature CSR program. Participating colleagues will guide 200 student participants from 20 schools across 12 countries and territories to develop creative mobility solutions, while also helping to close the STEM skills gap. This year, we aim to make a difference by helping communities adapt and leverage better design and newer technologies to address the mobility, health and safety concerns of older populations. We look forward to sharing these solutions and highlights of the program with you during our Lift Our Communities month in April of next year. Now turning to Slide 4; Q3 results and 2021 outlook. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% in Q3, and up 10.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Organic sales were up 8.1% in the third quarter with 14.1% organic growth in the New Equipment segment, and 3.6% organic growth in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was up $63 million and margin expanded 20 basis points despite a 50 basis point impact from segment mix as the New Equipment business grew faster than the Service business. Year-to-date, we generated robust free cash flow of $1.4 billion or 141% conversion of GAAP net income. This positive momentum and our progress on our long-term strategy, gives us the confidence to improve our 2021 outlook and positions us well to build upon this strong performance in 2022. We now expect sales for the year to be approximately $14.3 billion, up 11.8% to 12.3% versus the prior year, and up 8.5% to 9% organically. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be in the range of $2.18 billion to $2.19 billion, up $260 million to $270 million at actual currency, and up $195 million to $205 million at constant currency. We're improving adjusted EPS from the prior outlook by $0.04 at the midpoint and $0.06 from the low end and now expect it to be approximately $2.95; a 17% increase versus the prior year. Lastly, we're improving our free cash flow outlook to approximately $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion with 125% conversion of GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our Q3 results and 2021 outlook in more detail. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Judy, and good morning everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales grew 10.8% to $3.6 billion as the strong growth momentum continued in New Equipment, and Service grew for the third consecutive quarter. Adjusted operating profit was up 12.5% or $63 million and up $52 million at constant currency, primarily from the benefit of higher volume in both segments. Installation productivity initiatives in New Equipment and favorable Service pricing and productivity helped to offset the headwinds from commodity inflation and the absence of temporary cost actions taken last year to alleviate the impact from COVID-19. We maintained the focus on cost containment, while continuing to invest in the business. Adjusted SG&A was down 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, despite the step up in public company expenses. R&D and other strategic investments were up slightly versus prior year and were about flat as a percentage of sales. This strong focus on execution resulted in 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 70 basis points of margin expansion at constant segment mix. Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 11.6% or $0.08, driven by $0.11 of operating profit growth, partially offset by $0.04 from a higher adjusted tax rate due to the absence of a cumulative year-to-date tax benefit in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, the adjusted tax rate is down by 180 basis points. Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up 3.8% at constant currency. Orders momentum remained strong in Asia, up mid-teens, including sixth consecutive quarter of growth in China. As expected, after 47% growth in the second quarter, orders declined year-over-year in the Americas, primarily due to timing as awards which precede order booking in North America were up approximately 24% versus the prior year. EMEA was down 1.8% from the timing of major project orders. Proposal volumes in the quarter also continued to show signs of strong demand globally, up double-digits. Total company backlog increased 4% and 1% at constant currency from strong growth in China. Pricing on new orders declined by over 1 point and backlog margin was down about 1 point versus prior year. Both, pricing on new orders and backlog margin, were about flat sequentially. Year-to-date, New Equipment orders were up 15%, including 13% growth in the Americas, mid-single-digit growth in EMEA, and approximately 20% growth in Asia. Organic sales were up 14.1% with growth in all regions. Americas was up mid-teens, driven by strong backlog execution as the business surpassed pre-COVID levels. EMEA was up low-single-digits and Asia grew high-teens, driven by China, where organic sales were up double-digits. New Equipment adjusted operating profit was up $33 million from higher volume. Pricing was marginally unfavorable in the quarter and higher commodity prices were a headwind of $35 million, but we more than mitigated these impacts through strong installation execution, including favorable project closeouts, leading to 80 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Service segment results on Slide 7. Maintenance portfolio units were up 3% versus the prior year with global improvements in retention, recapture and conversion rates. The number of units increased in all regions, and China was up high-teens, accelerating from the mid-teens growth in the second quarter. There was pressure on modernization demand in the third quarter and modernization orders were down 4.1% at constant currency as growth in EMEA and Asia was offset by decline in the Americas, primarily driven by timing of orders as the market is recovering strongly in 2021. Overall, modernization backlog was up 2% at constant currency. Service organic sales were up 3.6% with growth for the third consecutive quarter, as the business continues to recover from the impact of COVID. Maintenance & Repair grew 4.7% with strong recovery in repair and low single-digit growth in contractual maintenance sales. Modernization sales were down 1.2% as growth in Europe and China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific from lingering COVID-related lockdowns, and in the Americas from supply chain shortages. Adjusted operating profit grew $27 million as higher volume productivity initiatives and improved pricing and mix more than offset the absence of favorability from COVID-related cost containment actions taken in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up 30 basis points. Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with approximately 1.5 points of New Equipment share gain; our best portfolio growth in the last decade, 11% organic sales growth and $261 million of adjusted operating profit growth with margin expansion in both segments. We also generated close to $1.4 billion in free cash flow, enabling us to complete $725 million in share repurchases, raise dividends earlier this year, continue with bolt-on acquisitions, and announce the tender offer for the remaining stake in Zardoya Otis. Looking forward to the balance of the year on Slide 8. We feel confident about strong growth across all key metrics for the year. We now expect organic sales to be up 8.5% to 9%, up 1 point from the prior outlook with improvement in New Equipment segment. We now expect operating profit to grow between $260 million to $270 million, up $15 million from prior outlook at the midpoint with sales growth, operating profit growth and margin expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be approximately $2.95; $0.04 higher than prior outlook at the midpoint, and up 17% versus the prior year. The year-over-year EPS increase is driven by strong operating profit growth, a reduction in the adjusted tax rate, and a reduced share count. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in a range of 28.5% to 29%; more than 150 basis point reduction versus the prior year and a 25 basis point improvement from the prior outlook at the midpoint. Following strong year-to-date cash generation from net income growth and over $300 million reduction in working capital from the end of last year, we now expect free cash flow for the year to be between $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion. This is up $50 million from the prior outlook from improved net income and reduced working capital. Taking a further look at the organic sales outlook on Slide 9. New Equipment is now projected to be up 15% to 15.5%, driven by accelerated backlog conversion and a 15% year-to-date orders growth. This is an increase of more than 250 basis points from the prior outlook and over 11 point improvement from our expectations at the beginning of the year. This broad-based improvement in expectations is supported by robust market growth in all regions, strong year-to-date performance and continued backlog growth. Americas is now up high-teens -- sorry up mid-teens; EMEA up high-single-digits; and Asia up high-teens, driven by China. In Service, we are adjusting our outlook to approximately 4% growth, the lower end of the prior range, reflecting slower than expected recovery on modernization in the second half of the year. Modernization is now expected to be up approximately 4% for the year from up mid-single-digit previously driven by COVID-related job site restrictions in Asia Pacific, slower decision making in EMEA and some parts shortages in the Americas. Despite the resurgence of COVID in Asia Pacific, there is no change to the Maintenance & Repair outlook, that is still expected to be up approximately 4% for the year, driven by continued maintenance portfolio growth and recovery in discretionary repair. Overall, the organic sales growth outlook of 8.5% to 9% reflects a strong year-to-date performance and good momentum positioning us well to deliver growth across all regions and all lines of business, while building backlog to support continued growth in 2022. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. We now expect operating profit to be up between $260 million to $270 million versus the prior year with margin expansion of 30 basis points. At constant currency, operating profit is expected to be up between $195 million to $205 million. This represents an improvement of $15 million versus the prior outlook from the impact of updated volume expectations in both segments and actions taken to reduce the corporate expenses. FX tailwind is now expected to be approximately $65 million from $70 million that we were expecting previously, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro impacting the profit growth in the Service business. The year-over-year growth in operating profit reflects the benefits of higher volume, Service productivity initiatives, favorable Service pricing and strong installation execution. It is partially offset by unfavorable New Equipment price mix, headwinds from the absence of prior-year cost containment actions related to COVID-19 and higher commodity prices. The headwind from commodities is now expected to be between $80 million to $90 million for the year; at the higher end of what we communicated in July, driven partially by higher New Equipment volume in the year. The broader price increases announced last quarter have been rolled out and will help to alleviate the impact from higher commodity prices in 2022. Overall, this strong outlook puts us more than $1 billion ahead of our 2019 reported revenue with 100 basis points of margin expansion. 2021 sales, earnings and margin in both segments are expected to be higher than 2019 and adjusted EPS is expected to be up more than 30% versus 2019, reflecting broad-based improvement in performance, driven by our ability to execute implementation of the long-term strategy and the benefits of a solid end market recovery. And with that, I'll request Michelle to please open the line for questions. Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Thanks, good morning. Hope everyone's well. So, I hate to start off with the obvious question, but maybe we'd just talk about China, obviously a lot of noise in that country. I know there's a -- in the appendix, there's a useful chart around sort of risky developers, but just curious what you're seeing on the ground, real time and then maybe just how share price and mix is evolving in China. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Sure. Good morning, Nigel. Good to hear from you. So let me try to put China into context and we hope that chart was helpful. As we entered this year, we were expecting mid-single-digit growth in China. We have actually seen stronger growth year-to-date and the segment itself, we believe, will end the year at high-single-digits. Through the first nine months, all sectors in China have been strong; residential, commercial and infrastructure. We've seen increased activity in Tier 1 and 2 cities, as well as in infrastructure and with our key accounts. The third quarter segment, we believe, grew mid-single-digit, and we anticipate and have planned for the fourth quarter to be down correspondingly mid-single-digit. So if we go back to '20, we thought it was going to be mid-single-digit growth, we've seen that. '21, we've seen high-single-digit growth. We're still seeing healthy demand. This is the sixth quarter in a row that we've had New Equipment growth in China, but we're trying to be prudent for 2022 and we've actually planned for a flattish market there and we're going to control what we can and what we know how to control. There is clearly heightened possibilities, there could be declines next year, given the macro environment in the property sector, but we believe that the strategy we've put in place and the initiatives we've put for sales coverage, for share gain and for price are really all paying off. We've added, agents and distributors. So now we're at 2,300. We've added another 150 A&Ds in the third quarter. As Rahul shared in his opening comments, our portfolio growth is in the high-teens. So our Service strategy is paying off with more coverage and more Service depots. And our proposal volume was up significantly this quarter. So, again, we're being prudent, we're watching what's going on. But we have put in place price increases. Those will yield in '22. They won't yield quicker than that because of our long-cycle business, but we're managing that as well. And I just will call your attention to that chart in the appendix and just put that as well into context. We did 10s of millions of dollars of revenue across approximately 10 customers that have breached either the two or three red lines with their liquidity issues. And we share that those 10 customers are less than 3% of our China sales through the third quarter and less than 1% of Otis sales through the third quarter and -- but we've been mitigating this since the three red line policy has come into play and for any of these customers across these red lines, we've moved to a cash -- advance cash basis. So we are working this on an account-by-account basis. We do not believe and we've shared that the exposure is not large and we're going to continue to managing this effectively and executing our strategy. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Thanks, Judy. That's very helpful. And then obviously supply chain is another key issue. One of your competitors called out some impacts from that, but also called out some project delays which be behind some of the New Equipment's weakness that they saw. I'm just curious, are you seeing any -- it doesn't seem like it, but are you seeing any weaknesses caused by delays on the construction projects and are we seeing inflationary impact on steel, causing some delays to tendering activities out there? Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Let me start with the steel and, Rahul, please add. We're not seeing delays due to steel. Obviously steel and again it's, in our New Equipment business, about $300 million a year of commodities that we purchase. We've been able to purchase it. But obviously with the steel prices at fairly escalated prices and Rahul shared, we've increased $80 million to $90 million our impact on commodities this year, primarily driven by our volumes being up versus what we shared with you in July. So steel is not causing delays. We are not seeing significant delays on job sites in terms of labor. We're all watching installation subcontract labor, especially in Europe, but in terms of Otis labor, we have not had any delays in any of our job sites. And we've put plans in place. Our supply chain team has been dealing with this extremely effectively now for almost two years. Whether it's semiconductors, ocean freight, we have not had delays in delivering to job sites from our New Equipment, some of that's the benefit of our factories being local and our supply chains being local with global agreements, but we have done everything from spot buys and redesigning some of our chipsets, from an engineering perspective to use more common chips, to make sure there was no impact to our customers. So we've not seen that. But Rahul, I'd like you to add. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The only place -- and I'm sure we'll get there during the call, Nigel, is on modernization. It does impact our revenue because, as Judy said, on New Equipment, we can manage the shortages wherever we see them because we can have multiple shipments to the job site. Elevator doesn't go in one box or if it is completed unit, we actually assemble the elevator, as you guys know, on the job site. So it goes in couple of dozen crates, right? So whatever parts are short, we can ship them later. But on modernization jobs, it's a little bit harder because they're shorter in duration. So on modernization, we've seen some impact from raw material shortages and there is a little bit of a construction delay. It's not -- as Judy said, we are not experiencing delays from our factories. We can manage that. But there is a little bit of a construction slowdown for other shortages and that's impacting some revenue on the New Equipment side, especially here in the U.S., but other than that, I think we are OK overall. Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst Perfect. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Nigel. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you and good morning everyone. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research -- Analyst Good morning. Could we just talk about price a little bit first, I guess. Well, I think that price was down 1 point but but also flat sequentially. Is that correct? But really the larger question is a little bit of color on kind of the competitive environment as you see it. Your -- it does appear you're taking some share. Is there a competitive price response that you're dealing with there? And maybe a little bit of color on the price that you do have in the market currently when you do expect it to show up in the P&L. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, let me start with the pricing and I'll hand it to Judy to add some color on the competitive dynamics here. So overall, I think the numbers you quoted, Jeff, are exactly right. Pricing -- our overall pricing was down maybe slightly more than 1 point in Q3 here and was consistent with the book margins in Q2. And on a regional basis, EMEA was better year-over-year and pricing trends in both Asia Pacific and China were largely consistent with the first half and Americas pricing was slightly worse than first half, and it's more the mix of customers is where we saw the pressure. The distribution was a smaller share of orders and that's a little bit -- comes at a little bit better pricing. But pricing in Americas in the volume business was consistent with the first half. So you put all that in context, the fact is the pricing trends, basically what we saw in the first half, is continuing into Q3. So no sequential change from the first half into Q3. And the price increases that we've put in place, we've rolled them out pretty much across the board at this point and where you will see that impact is those quotes have not yet converted to orders, which is fairly typical because that's the cycle from quotation to orders and they'll probably start up maybe showing up in late Q4 or early Q1. And the benefit of that, as Judy said in response to Nigel's question, will probably show up in 2022. Let me pause there, see if -- and Judy if you want to add something on competitive dynamics. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer And listen, Jeff, we're seeing strong competition, I think, across the board and we're seeing varying levels of price increase and we have rolled out -- we shared with you in our second quarter earnings, that we had rolled out some limited price increases early in the year and then we went, right after our second quarter earnings call ended, global price increases at varying levels to understand and see what we could get in the market, because we have, obviously, cost increases in terms of inflationary labor costs, as well as input costs and commodities. Rahul hit it right on. And the only thing I would tell you is we are seeing some headwinds on pricing, but we're up -- our New Equipment margins are up 150 basis points year-to-date. So we're able to, as we've always said, try to get it with price but we understand the lag time, increase our installation efficiency, which we did very well in the third quarter globally, as well as continue to control what we can in terms of productivity in our factories, material productivity and every lever we have. So it's going to be competitive. It's going to continue to be, but the end markets are growing across the globe, so strong demand, and we're going to continue to try and get price everywhere we can. Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research -- Analyst Great. And then just a follow-up on China for me. Maybe just a little bit more color on what you're seeing on kind of bid and proposal on forward pipeline. And then really the nature of my question is, it seems like there is some government pressure on these developers to complete projects, right, which may give us some forward momentum. But in terms of kind of the -- what you can see on the horizon, the visibility that you have, just any other color there I think would be interesting. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes. So Jeff what I'll say there is, I think I said in my prepared remarks, our proposal volume was up very strongly across the board and it was very, very strong in China. And it's -- our proposal volume was up close to 40% in China. I think that goes back to what Judy said earlier is it's driven by all the things that we have done, our increase in our channel partners, increase in our sales force. Our sales force is up by more than 10% in addition to the growth in the channel partners. So we have invested a ton to increase our reach in China, which is up close to 10 points as well. So all the things that we are doing is driving incremental activity on our side. But if you step back and even look at the market overall, if you look at the floor space under construction is up 8% year-to-date and 10%- plus over 2019. The real estate investment is up 9% year-over-year. So -- and historically, there has been a very, very strong correlation between these two metrics and the elevator growth. But the reality is the situation is fluid today and after a very strong start in the first half, this -- the starts have slowed down in the last couple of months. So we are watching it very, very carefully. But again, I think if you want to grow the overall economy next year, even if you say that the Chinese government doesn't set a target of 6% but they set a target of 5%, with 30% of the GDP coming from the property market, it will be hard for them to achieve 5% to 6% growth next year with the property market being down. So this is where, I think, going back to what Judy said earlier, we expect the market to be more stable for next year, but again we'll keep watching it and keep doing what we can control, which is driving incremental effort on our side and the healthy proposal activity is a good sign for us to come. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Jeff, let me just add one or two other things. As we said, our share gain on New Equipment share, both for the quarter and for the year, so far is 150 basis points. It's at least that in China, so, including in the third quarter. So we're -- our strategy really is working there. Second, we've already been approached by people other than these developers in local governments to finish some job sites on an advance cash basis. So we believe the work in progress is going to continue even with the developers that are experiencing two or three red lines. And so we're -- but again we're being prudent, we're planning for a flattish '22 and we're going to continue to execute our strategies to gain share in that flattish '22. Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research -- Analyst Great, thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the backlog margin because I thought that maybe pricing would be sort of filtering through more quickly, but I think the backlog margins down 100 points, and it was down, I think, 50 points in Q2. So how should we think about the backlog margin sort of from here looking out over the next two or three quarters? Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, no, I think, Julian, you're exactly right. The back -- the numbers you quoted are exactly right. Backlog margin was down about 1 point. And last quarter we did, say, kind of 0.5 point, so you're exactly right. So it got slightly worse, and again I think going back to what we said earlier, what you will see is that the pricing that we have put out in the market, that should start showing up in late Q4 or early Q1 and that is where you will see -- start seeing an improvement in both our book margin and backlog margin. So that is when we expect the trends to turn. But in the meanwhile, going back to our earlier response, we are just continuing to execute, really, really well on the installation side and that is what's driving our increase in year-to-date margin. So that is offsetting both the pricing pressure and the commodity headwinds. I mean, despite both those headwinds between incremental volumes that drives higher absorption and the installation execution, which we've said was always our priority, between those two things, that's what's helping us continue to grow our New Equipment margin. And if you look at even the full year guide, last quarter we said, maybe it's 90 basis points in this quarter, it's up 90 basis points for the year, margin expansion, and this guide, we think, it's between 90 basis points to 100 basis points. So despite everything, we are actually improving our margin outlook on the New Equipment segment for the year. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Julian, we've really pivoted to grow off our Service productivity, process changes, technology changes to really -- we've always believed there was opportunity on installation and that's where we've been focused again, especially with trying to overcome both the backlog margin and the commodity pressures on New Equipment and that's what you're seeing come through. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst That's helpful. And then maybe just on the New Equipment orders by region. So clearly people are very focused on the China and Asia numbers. But in Q3, those were very good still. I thought what was more interesting for me was Americas and EMEA. I realize it's lumpy but you had the down orders there on New Equipment. I just wondered, when you compare this upcycle in non-residential with the one 12 years ago, this upcycle has recovered far more quickly out of the recession than coming out of 2009. So the slope of it from here, you sort of thinking that we had an exceptionally strong V-shape and now the growth from here is fairly muted. Again, this is sort of ex-Asia and ex-China. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, let me talk to the Americas first. I mean if you look at our guide, first of all, we've seen a faster sustained recovery in the Americas, whether you go back to the GFC or 12 years ago, Julian. It's at the end of the GFC, which is really when we felt it more in the Americas and our guide has us going up mid-teens from the low-teens. We've got a strong backlog execution and, year-to-date in the Americas, if you take out the lumpiness and just go year-to-date, we're at 13.3% growth in the Americas in a 12-month roll of a healthy number as well. So we see the Americas doing -- coming back strong. The Dodge Momentum Index was up to 164.9 and the Architects Billing Index was at 56.6. So the -- these are trending the right way and we're doing well. Again, it's -- and no one quarter makes an orders book. We don't control all the timing on those orders. But year-to-date, the Americas has done tremendously, incredible second quarter and now again in the third quarter. EMEA 6.3% year-to-date, down a little in the third quarter, but that's kind of timing and we think we'll see both of those nicely accelerate in Q4 and that's important for us. We want to end the year with higher than the 1% backlog we're sitting at today. And our entire team understands that. We believe we can do that in the Americas because the awards are up, as Rahul said in his opening remarks, and that is a leading indicator, where we've got the awards already and we've got the LOI's and now we have to move it to a booking and get everything finished. But we expect a strong fourth quarter and plan to end the year with a backlog that will -- of 2%-plus, hopefully closer to 3%. We'll have to see where that comes out so that we start '22 strong. Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- Analyst That's great. Thank you. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Julian. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Patrick Baumann -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Hi, good morning, Judy. Good morning, Rahul. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just on the China exposure you detailed in the appendix. Just wanted to test the sensitivity on that versus the macro stat. So -- I mean you said you're planning for a flattish market. Does the assumption for a flattish market there embed any decline in floor starts? I'm just trying to understand how much of your initiatives there and your exposures there could help mitigate a decline in floor starts. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I think it's an interesting question, Patrick. Again it's hard to draw a direct correlation between any of these metrics into [Speech Overlap] exactly the elevator markets because it depends on what's going on in the market, how many buildings are under construction, we're obviously declining. And the floor starts have been down just the last couple of months after a very, very strong first half. So it's been -- we've seen them in the last couple of months, but again, the first half was very strong. So that is where if you come back and if you look at the other metrics, which I won't repeat because you've gone through those, like the construction and the real estate investment, I mean, they've -- historically, they've had a pretty high correlation with the elevator market. So that is where we saw, at least [Phonetic], the market is going to be more flattish for next year. And keep in mind, that start level is at more than 600,000 units and comes after two very strong years of growth; high-single-digits this year and mid-single-digits last year. So we think if the market stabilizes at this level, that's a very healthy demand for the market and driven by all those self-help initiatives that we are driving gives us an opportunity to continue to drive gains in our China business. Patrick Baumann -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Okay. So it's not as simple as taking 20% of sales and saying, OK, floor starts are down 10%, that's what we should attribute to Otis. It's more complex than that. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer For sure. Yes. Patrick Baumann -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst And then if you could -- just as a follow-up, can you help bridge that 20% of sales from China down to earnings, how big a percentage of earnings is that when we take into account like the impacts from joint ventures etc.? And then within that, how much of that earnings is aftermarket or service versus kind of direct to residential OE exposure? Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well, yeah, we haven't -- we typically do not report that way, Patrick. But let me see what we can do here on the call. So if you take our China business and our year-to-date sales of about $2.1 billion or so, so that's our revenue for China year-to-date. Now it's typically 80-20, 80% New Equipment and 20% Service. So -- and the Service business is accelerating very, very nicely as well, driven by the portfolio growth that we've been talking about. And what we've said historically is that China is one of our more profitable New Equipment businesses, in fact, the most profitable of all regions in terms of how we report. And on the Service side, it is the least profitable of our regions. So -- and then you put the mix on top of it, so that the mix in the New Equipment-Service mix also works against the overall drop in China. So that said, [Indecipherable] the overall, I mean, you put all that together, the China profitability is maybe overall lower than where orders reports. So that's kind of where we are. And then obviously the JV shares, we've got two JVs in China. And we've not disclosed our ownership, but obviously some somewhere between 50% to 100%. So it's somewhere in there. But you're right, I mean obviously the profit that we earn in China gets shared with our JV partners. Patrick Baumann -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Right. So without giving a specific number on that, obviously less than 20% of earnings, but is it less than 10% of earnings? I don't want an exact number, just kind of curious as a follow-up. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Patrick, I just want to stay away from that on the call. I think that's -- we report via our segments. I think we've provided enough color here and I think you guys can more than [Indecipherable] all of you guys to do the math. So we'll leave it there. [Speech Overlap] Patrick Baumann -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Okay. Thanks so much, I appreciate the time. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Patrick. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks so much for taking... Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Cai. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Yes, good morning, Rahul. So first Q4 cash flow, it looks like you're guiding to $170 million, maybe refresh my memory in terms of what do you have that kind of depresses that number. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So first, Cai, really great year on cash. I mean if you think about the working capital reduction that we've been able to drive, we've had our third consecutive quarter of negative working capital. It's down, as I said in my prepared remarks, more than $300 million from where we ended the year. So very, very strong performance on cash. Now, the two things that kind of -- I would say three things that work as you go from sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, the first is that there is historically a buildup of working capital between third quarter and fourth quarters. So if you look at the last couple of years where cash flow is available, you will see an increase in working capital from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that's one driver. The second is, based on the guide that we've provided, there is lower net income in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. So that's the second piece. And we still have that tax payment in one of the European countries that we've alluded to before. That's a long-standing tax matter that pre-dates spin, that we still need to make in the fourth quarter here and that we've cited previously between at 10s of millions of dollars. So those are the kind of the three big levers, I would say, as we go from third quarter to fourth quarter cash flow. So that is why fourth quarter cash flow is less, but still $50 million higher than where we were three months ago and it's driven by improvement in net income and better working capital performance and a very, very healthy number for the year. I think it's close to 125%. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, and we're going to be past our mid-term guidance we gave at Investor Day in terms of cash flow for the second year. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Yeah, so the -- yeah, the big abnormal thing is the tax payment. And then on the Zardoya purchase, I mean if you took that cash and bought back stock, it looks like Zardoya is modestly maybe 1% accretive to full year basis. And you already control it. So maybe walk us through some of the potential opportunities. For example, I think we've discussed this offline, but Spain has a tax rate of 25%. I mean, do you -- and I assume you're going to issue euro bond debt. And so, are you able to expense that at a higher tax rate? So what are some of the benefits from the consolidation? Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well, let me talk about the financial piece... Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer And I'll talk about the operational. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Then Judy -- I'll hand it over to Judy to kind of talk about the operational opportunities that we have. So from a financial standpoint, Cai, It's very, very straightforward. I mean, you look at our -- there is a -- and I think we said that in our press release, about $80 million of net cash outflow that we make to our JV partners there, both minority and the family, the small share -- individual shareowner and the institutional shareowners and the family combined, so that's about $80 million. Now if we -- so that obviously -- that's something that we don't have to make once we have full control and ownership of Zardoya. And then we will borrow, as you said. Our intention is to borrow in Europe. So we'll do the borrowing in Europe, and so that is where if you net the two out, we expect mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Now in 2022, it's going to be less than that because the fact is that it's going to take us a few months here. We just filed the prospectus. It's going to take three to four months for that filing to get approved. Then we launch the tender, then there is a delisting period and it may take us time to ramp up to the full ownership. So there is going to be a staggered increase in our ownership and that is where I think we said in the press release, we expect maybe $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion in 2022, just given the timing of the close and the timing of acquisition of shares. So those two things will get us to $0.04 to $0.05 -- I think we said $0.04 to $0.06 in the press release, so somewhere in that range for '22 and then mid-single-digit percentage accretion in 2023. Hopefully that answers the question, Cai. And then I'll -- maybe Judy you want to talk about the operational... Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'll just make it simple because of the time. I mean first, Cai, this is going to simplify our corporate structure. It will allow us to eliminate the only remaining listed subsidiary we have and will save the public company costs that go with that as well. But it really will allow us to streamline our operations in Europe, which gives us the launching point in the future for some strategic growth opportunities. It's a great Service portfolio. We have three factories there. We love this business and we think it just -- yes, we control it, which is why we're not worried about any implementation risks because we have operational control right now. But as we think about some future strategic growth opportunities across the continent, this is going to give us just that full capability to optimize everything from our talent to our operations in our facilities. Cai von Rumohr -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst Terrific, thank you very much. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Cai. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hi, good morning everyone. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Morning, John. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Hi. So a lot of ground covered around pricing and commodities, but I'm just curious if you can help us think about maybe 2022 or maybe I'll even broaden it and just say in a deflationary environment, if we start to get some relief around commodities, if we've kind of hit the peak pain, so to say, this year, how do we think about your ability to kind of capture positive price cost spread? Are there certain things in your contracts or do some of those escalators maybe go away? Just trying to understand the price cost dynamics as we think into next year if we are starting to see some relief in commodities. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer So, yeah, that's a great question, John. And we have escalation capabilities in our Service contracts in most of Europe and the Americas that are primarily indexed to labor and most of those tend to renew, the majority, in the first quarter of the year. So we believe that will be to our benefit. Those clauses are resident in those contracts, and have been there for many, many years. We just haven't been able to exercise them. So we will certainly try to flow through Service price increases and we'll see what the market will bear there, but we have the ability to do that and the majority of them are indexed to labor. But there are some small portion that are indexed to material or commodities. Again we haven't had that opportunity. It is a customer negotiation point, but we think that will at least start off '22 stronger in terms of Service pricing. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah. And on New Equipment, again, I think we've said that before. We expect some commodity headwinds next year, John, on the New Equipment side. We do -- given where the commodity prices were in the first half of this year, we expect first half of next year to kind of be in the same range as where we were in the second half of this year, so call it $30 million to $35 million a quarter, so maybe $70 million for the first half. And then beyond that, if you look at the commodity forwards today, they start going the other way starting May, June of '22 and we start -- right now the forwards would project that there will be tailwind in the second half of next year. But it's too early to call that. But again, go back to our pieces, it's going to be that for next year, we can continue driving earnings expansion, both -- in both segments; New Equipment coming from higher volume, given where Judy said, there'll be a plan to ending the backlog at kind of in that low-single-digit growth range. So we'll continue to drive revenue growth in the New Equipment segment with incremental -- some help from pricing that we've already put in place and our continued execution installation. We think we can use all that to offset any commodity headwinds in the first half and drive earnings expansion. And on Service, I think our pricing should be a tailwind for next year, given where prices are and the volume should accelerate to kind of more mid-single-digit growth, which is what we expect. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. We've seen really good year-to-date snapback on repair, John, and we expect that to continue in fourth quarter and into next year globally, and then if we can get some of these maintenance escalators. But Service pricing has been held up really strong. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Yeah. No, I appreciate the details there. And then maybe just a follow-up here on China. A lot of ground covered already, but as I think about Otis' opportunity within China, there is kind of the market piece, but also the share gains and was just curious as you look in a flat market, if that does prove to be the case, how should we think about Otis' ability to gain share in a flat market? Is this 1.5 points kind of the right bogey? Could it be better? Should we temper ourselves a little bit? Just would love to get your thoughts on that. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And we'll share more obviously as we give guidance in '22. But our China team has taken on the challenge to grow share and grow portfolio and they've done both robustly this year. And we've lived through declining markets, you go back to '15, to '18, we were the first to emerge, really '18, '19 and to drive price increases there when others didn't want to follow. And now we've really, I think, proven share gain for two straight years and again sixth consecutive quarter of New Equipment growth while we're getting that share gain and driving profitability. So whether it's flat or up, we intend to gain share. John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Great, thanks for taking the questions. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Sure. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Miguel Borrega with Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Miguel Borrega -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst Hi, good morning everyone. I've got a couple of question, if I may. The first one, again, coming back on China. Can you comment on how are your clients reacting to this pre-payments that you're asking for? I believe you mentioned on Slide 16. Is this something you just started asking or are you now rolling over to all new orders instead of a select few? Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer So we have been -- the three red lines came into effect, if I get the month right, August of '20, but some -- certainly sometime during the '20 third quarter. And we've been monitoring this closely and if we have clients who are not going to go to this cash payment, then we've stopped taking orders from them, to be candid. We're managing it effectively and, what we think is, prudently in a risk mitigation perspective, so that we don't get out ahead of their liquidity issues or become the holder of their liquidity issues. So they understand it. We've been very upfront with them. Again, we go account by account. That's why you have these relationships and we have these open discussions. Miguel Borrega -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst Thank you. And I would be interested in understanding the 10% increase that you mentioned on your sales force in China. Can you shed some color on when -- where are you investing? Are these Tier 1 cities or are you extending more into Tier 3 cities? And can you remind us your exposure in terms of segments in China resi-commercial and infrastructure? Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah, so our sales force, I mean, obviously it's pretty broad-based, Miguel, and it's both in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. I mean that is something we've done so that as we are adding more channel partners we need our sales force to support the channel partners that we are hiring and gain our fair share of wallet from those agents and distributors. So that is where our incremental sales force is going and it's split between both New Equipment and Service because that's the -- that's what we need to do to drive our Service portfolio growth. And in terms of our overall make, I think we are -- we do fairly well in every segment, both residential-commercial and infrastructure. So we have a fairly strong presence across all verticals. Now obviously, it depends on where the market is and we've been -- we've been focused a lot more on the infrastructure recently and that is where -- if you look back at what we've shared on our Investor Day, that is where we have gained a few points of share. So we continue to do well across all segments. And I think our share base -- share gain is fairly broad-based. Miguel Borrega -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst Thank you very much. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Miguel. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Housden with RBC Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Nicholas Housden -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. Hi everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick ones for me. You've mentioned productivity gain a few times as a driver of the pretty good margin result. I'm just wondering if you can maybe quantify that a little bit more and also tell us, to what extent, there is still potential here going forward in the next few quarters. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So our productivity gain is coming from both segments, Nick. It's coming from New Equipment. We are -- it's -- we spoke about the material productivity starting right when we did our first Investor Day. So we've been talking about that's a key driver for us. So we continue to push really, really hard on that. In addition, we've been driving installation efficiency. So that means better project closeouts and ending the project at a higher margin than what we booked at. And that includes both using fewer hours to install the product and taking cost out of the material because not the entire material cost comes from the fact -- there is incremental material procurement that happens in the field. So we've been spending a lot of time and effort to understanding where the supply base is and how we can take cost out of that. So that has been the major push here and that is where you're seeing. And again, we are in early stages of that. We just started it, we saw good results in Q2, we saw good results in Q3. So we're in early stages of that and we need that installation efficiency to continue to get better as we get into '22. So that will be a push for us. And on Service productivity, which again has been a tailwind for us despite catch-up of maintenance hours and all the COVID-related headwinds that we are absorbing, our Q3 hours are still down year-over-year to maintain an elevator. So that comes from the push that we have on Otis ONE and some of the other productivity things that we're doing. So that is what is driving our Service productivity, which continues to be -- which continue to be strong in Q2. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. And that's obviously what drives our profitability, yeah. Nicholas Housden -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's great. And then just very quickly on the tax rate. You mentioned 28.5% to 29% for this year. Is that about the right number going forward or should we expect something a bit different? Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer No. So, we guided at Investor Day and after that actually, that we expect that to continue to go down and to get to about 26.5% at really -- that's what we're expecting over the mid term, really two strong years in a row, Nick. We had brought it down to about 30.4% last year from over 34% in our first year and then another, as we said, 180 basis points this year to get us to the midpoint between 28.5% and 29%. So really good focus and it's -- now what we have to do is operationalize a lot of it, but we know the path, we know the trajectory and we're going to continue down that path to get us closer to that 26.5%. Nicholas Housden -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst That's great, thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Joel Spungin with Berenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joel Spungin -- Berenberg -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning. You've obviously covered a lot. So just two quickly. Maybe if I can just start with China again on your Slide 16, just to help me understand when you talk about the 3% of China sales, that's -- is that both your direct and indirect total exposure to those property development, so including sales by a third-party distributors, whatever it might be? And I guess the reason I'm asking just maybe to open up because I'm interested to hear your thoughts is that the risk here might not just be with potentially an Evergrande or whoever is going bust, but actually that it causes distress in the distribution network in China and that you have exposure to distributors who might be put at risk if some of these guys go under. So, yeah, I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about that in terms of what this 3% number is just to clarify that. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So the 3% represents our sales to these customers, both direct and indirect, yes. So that's a total exposure to these customers. I think your question, Joel, is right, if -- and I think it goes to a broader contagion issue, which obviously is not represented on this chart. And again that goes back to all the discussion that we -- Joel, that we've had on this call around our expectations for the China market. So not to rehash all of that, but we do expect that this is going to be -- we do expect the China elevator and escalator market to be more flattish next year. So that's our current expectation. And -- but this 3% is our total exposure to these customers. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer All-in. Rahul Ghai -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer All-in. Joel Spungin -- Berenberg -- Analyst Okay, thank you. And then maybe just one final one, quickly, which was just on your comments around modernization, which I thought were interesting. I mean it sounds like you're slightly tempering your expectations for the fourth quarter in terms of modernization. Do you think that there is -- there are some bottlenecks here, like some of these issues are likely to result in some pent-up demand being released in 2022? I'm just interested, for example, your comments about EMEA going through delayed decision making, whether or not that's likely to sort of come through faster maybe next year. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. In mod, Joel, we think it really is demand delay versus disruption -- versus elimination actually or destruction. The challenge on mod is it is somewhat more bespoke than New Equipment and custom, and that, at least in the Americas, has created a little bit of a supply chain challenge for us. So we're dealing with it. I think we've appropriately tempered the fourth quarter to the low end of the Service guidance for that reason. But we don't see this or the EMEA demand or the Asia Pacific demand going away by any point. Modernization is going to continue to grow and we know what we need to do. If you look all-in, year-to-date, our orders are up 4.3% and our sales are up 2.7%. So we think the fourth quarter reflects that kind of knowledge as well as what we're experiencing and '22 should be stronger. Joel Spungin -- Berenberg -- Analyst Okay, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Judy Marks for any further remarks. Judy Marks -- President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks, Michelle. This solid year-to-date performance, positive momentum and our ability to execute on our long-term strategy gives us confidence we'll deliver a strong close to 2021 with high-single-digit organic sales growth, $260 million to $270 million in operating profit growth and high-teens EPS growth. While the external environment remains fluid, I'm confident the investments we've made over the last few years and our progress as an independent company have set a new path and will position us well for 2022. As always, we remain focused on driving value for our customers, our colleagues, our communities and our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today and stay safe and well.

The single-camera series, inspired by Serrano’s life growing up in San Antonio, will stream exclusively in the U.S. and UK on IMDb TV, Amazon’s AMZN premium free streaming service. Primo is a heartwarming and highly entertaining coming-of-age comedy about a teenager balancing college aspirations, societal expectations, and a hectic home life anchored by his single mom and five uncles. The half-hour series is written and executive produced by Serrano, a New York Times NYT best-selling author whose childhood stories are the foundation for this semi-autobiographical comedy. Serrano serves as creator and executive producer for the series, alongside executive producers Michael Schur via Fremulon, David Miner for 3 Arts Entertainment, and Morgan Sackett. Primo is produced by Amazon Studios and Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group. “Do you remember when the Spurs won the 2014 title after having their hearts broken in the 2013 Finals? That’s what I feel like right now. I couldn’t be happier, I couldn’t be prouder, I couldn’t be more thankful. Honestly, I still kind of can’t even believe that this is happening,” said Serrano. Mike Schur IMDb TV MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge \"When I first met Shea Serrano, I personally guaranteed him that someday I would make him feel like the 2014 Spurs did after winning the NBA championship. I'm thrilled to have achieved my goal. And I'm doubly thrilled to work with him and IMDb TV on this hilarious and heartwarming show,\" said Schur. “It is a dream to be in business with these two incredible writers. Their individual talents have combined to make an insightful, relevant, and genuinely funny show. More than just making us laugh, these scripts simultaneously reminded us of the angst of adolescence, the dizzying magic of first love, how friends become family, and how family imprints us for life,” said Lauren Anderson and Ryan Pirozzi, co-heads of content and programming at IMDb TV. “IMDb TV’s commitment to telling broad, timely, and highly entertaining stories is perfectly illustrated in Primo, and we know the series will deeply resonate with our viewers.” “We’re thrilled that our partners at IMDb TV have picked up Primo! This project has been a long time in the making, and we’re incredibly proud to see Shea’s memorable and funny experiences come to life on the small screen,” said Jim Donnelly, EVP, comedy development, Universal Television. “From his best-selling books to this new show, Shea’s storytelling will captivate audiences not unlike power forward Tim Duncan captivated Spurs fans from 1997-2016.” Serrano is an author, screenwriter, and journalist.

[+] Presidential Palace on June 27, 2016 in Paris, France. Getty Images Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates is letting college students download his book, “How To Avoid A Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have And The Breakthroughs We Need,” for free—for a limited time. For this week only, students enrolled at any college or university around the world can input their email and the name of their school to get the free ebook by downloading it from Gates’ blog, GatesNotes . In a blog post announcing the free download, Gates wrote that young people will need to be at the forefront of making technological and policy innovations necessary to combat climate change. “In my experience, they’re the ones with the most new ideas, and the most energy to pursue them,” Gates said. Released in February, Gates’ book lays out how the fourth-richest person in the world thinks we can get to zero emissions by 2050. He advocates for the need to invest in new technologies that provide a cheaper and greener alternative to carbon-emitting methods used by heavy industry and other sectors like energy and transportation. “The hardest problems to solve are in areas like steel and concrete and even transportation things like aviation fuel,” Gates told Forbes in an interview when the book was released. Gates’ approach hasn’t impressed everyone. Climate activist Bill McKibben called “How To Avoid A Climate Disaster” “underwhelming” in a review for the New York Times . McKibben argued the book did not grapple with “the role that the fossil fuel industry played, and continues to play, in preventing action,” especially when it comes to wide adoption of wind and solar power.

    "content": "Shipping containers are moved from the Fairview Cove Container Terminal In Halifax in May 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan In 2019, global supply chains moved more than US$19 trillion in exported goods. The production and sale of many items we need and use — including toys, clothes, food, electronics and home furniture — depend on global supply chains. For most of us, supply chains are no longer an abstract concept. The COVID-19 pandemic raised our awareness about the interdependence of our economic systems. We now understand the many ways these chains directly shape and impact our lives. The pandemic has also revealed the fragility of global supply chains as U.S. President Joe Biden and others warn of the impact on the world economy of continuing supply-chain bottlenecks. Cargo container ships are seen anchored outside the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif., in the fall of 2021. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) A supply chain is a set of organizations — like suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers — that work together to provide end customers with a specific product or service. The supply chain becomes global when the product or service crosses multiple international boundaries. Global supply chain organizations are directly and indirectly dependent on each other. Supply chain problems cascade Global supply chains have conventionally been focused on achieving financial efficiency above all else. The result is messy and fragile global supply chain systems. In practice, the decisions made and actions taken by each organization affect the performance of the entire supply chain. A problem at any point feeds other problems at different stages of the chain. A product shortage at a retail store, for example, might be caused by unsuspected problems such as labour issues, raw material shortages or clogged ports. Semiconductor shortages are disrupting the automobile industry. Meanwhile, the cost of moving a container from China to the west coast of North America is estimated to have increased by 650 per cent since before the pandemic. Shelves are nearly empty in the paper towel section of a Target store in the U.S. in August 2021 due to COVID-19 supply chain issues. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Race to the bottom The pursuit of financial efficiency has shifted global production to low-cost regions, increased the flows of freights, caused port congestion and eroded the resilience of supply chains. Cutting costs above all else became a race to the bottom. It resulted in global economies with limited redundancies, contingencies and safeguards. Fragile global supply chains are exacerbated by the fragmentation of decision-making processes, limited collaboration between buyers and suppliers and transactional management. There is no obvious centralized business or authority commanding and controlling these chains. Instead, several companies co-operate and compete for the value created. Global supply chains also account for large contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and have an impact on air, land and water biodiversity and geological resources. A typical company’s supply chain is responsible for 80 per cent of its greenhouse emissions and more than 90 per cent of its contribution to air pollution generated in the production and distribution of a consumer product. One billion metric tonnes of emissions could be saved if key suppliers to 125 of the world’s biggest purchasers increased their renewable energy input by 20 per cent. The impact of supply chains extends to society. For example, the problem of forced labour is well-documented in today’s global supply chains, resulting in several controversies about modern slavery. More than 24.9 million people are documented to be working in slavery conditions in these chains. Businesses in global supply chains are facing increased pressure from different stakeholders to adopt sustainability and disclose their impacts. A Dutch court recently ordered Shell to reduce its carbon emissions by 45 per cent from its 2019 levels. In the future, supply chain disclosure and transparency will become the norm of good governance. Former fishing slaves who were rescued by the Indonesian government from the remote island of Benjina are seen following a 2015 investigation into slavery in the seafood industry. (AP Photo/Margie Mason) Robust supply chains in demand The world needs robust supply chains that are founded on sustainability, collaboration, trust, transparency, visibility and diversification of supply. That new model of supply chains could help combat economic fragility, climate change and inequality. Global supply chains connect businesses and markets across all layers of economic, social and ecological systems. That means customers, governments and other stakeholders should encourage the emergence of robust and sustainable supply chains. Responsible decision-making within supply chains has the potential to contribute to economic progress and societal well-being while maintaining the environmental integrity of the planet. Our preliminary research on sustainable blueberry supply chains, to be published soon, indicates that sustainability contributes to resilience. Supply chain management is a “team sport.” Current research provides ample evidence that collaboration benefits global supply chains. Buyers and suppliers can enjoy higher service levels, more product availability and significant reductions in costs if they work together. More preliminary research we’ve conducted on personal protective equipment supply chains in British Columbia, also to be published in the weeks to come, shows that collaboration between the supplier and customer reduces costs and risks by at least 17 per cent. Effective collaboration contributes to supply chain resilience and helps avoid future disruptions. A driver for Safecare B.C. secures a load of personal protective equipment in a truck in Surrey, B.C. in April 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Building effective collaboration means rewarding responsible and long-term management of global supply chains and discouraging short-lived gains. Global supply chains should promote sharing the gains and the pains among buyers and suppliers. Incentives need to be created to encourage this collaboration. Digitization of the economy will also contribute to better transparency and traceability in global supply chains. Nonetheless, moving towards robust global supply chains isn’t straightforward because historically, they’ve been focused on short-term rewards. For decades, we’ve justified the development of fragile and fragmented global supply chains in the name of economic growth and financial efficiency. This may have provided short-term benefits, but it has created our current supply chain crisis. Will that crisis reveal a way forward?

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Auto refinancing website MotoRefi is now offering customers the chance to lower insurance costs ... [+] through a new service. ASSOCIATED PRESS/Carlos Osorio The insurance industry is all about convincing customers to bundle their policies putting all their coverage in the hands of one carrier. Now MotoRefi is shaking up that long-standing practice by offering a new option—bundling insurance with auto loan refinancing. The Washington D.C.-based startup announced the move Monday at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Las Vegas. When a consumer comes to the MotoRefi website to seek a better deal on their car loan, they'll also have the opportunity to be connected with an insurance carrier that may also offer lower coverage costs. Kevin Bennett, CEO, MotoRefi. The company provides access to finance companies to consumers who want ... [+] to refinance their auto loans. MotoRefi “Tens of thousands of people come to our site every month and come with the intent of refinancing their car and saving money, we're just offering them another chance to save money. A two for one,” MotoRefi CEO Kevin Bennett said in an interview. Bennett describes the insurance industry's method of bundling as “horizontal” providing convenience for the customer while boosting a carrier's profits. MotoRefi, he says, is rotating that concept 90 degrees.

Just how much money can be saved on auto insurance depends on the vehicle, driver and coverage level. But Bennett says his company is using the same model he says is saving those who refinance their car loans through the site about $100 a month. “We’re leveraging our existing tech stack, borrower profiles and relationships with both our refi customers and major players in the auto finance and insurance industry to secure amazing rates that we pass on directly to our customers,” Bennett said. So far MotoRefi is working with what Bennett described as a “large national carrier” but said the company will be “adding more in the near future.” Screenshot of MotoRefi website auto insurance page. MotoRefi Right now on the MotoRefi website there's an auto insurance page inviting visitors to “learn more,” which they may do if they're pursuing a loan refinance. “We are actually reaching out to a customer for whom we think we can provide a compelling offer and asking about their interest level. If so, we are connecting them with that carrier,” explained Bennett. The idea to bundle insurance with loan refinancing came from customer feedback Bennett explained. “We started talking to our customers about how else we can help them...and they told us we'd love you to help us get a better deal on auto insurance as well,” he said. That request may be rooted in the feeling by many owners that their vehicle has become a liability rather than an asset, Bennett surmised. He pointed to a 2020 study by the Triple A revealing annual cost of vehicle ownership can be as high as $10,000. This latest offering for MotoRefi comes during a two-year period of fast growth for the company. When it announced a $45 million round of Series B funding last May, MotoRefi reported between the first quarter of 2020 and Q1 2021 its revenue grew seven-fold, loan volume grew five-fold and its team grew by 2.5 times. That latest cash infusion followed a $10 million investment by Moderne Ventures in January. Bennett says MotoRefi's newest gambit combining auto loan refinancing with an insurance matchmaking service is not only a good business move, but an innovative combination of two technologies declaring, “This is really bringing fintech (financial technology) and insurtech (insureance technology) together in auto to help the consumer using cutting edge technology.”",

As of 11:50 a.m. EDT, Nio shares were at session highs up almost 5%. So what Over the weekend, Chinese competitor XPeng made some announcements about its autonomous technology that got investors excited. Investors have pushed XPeng shares more than 10% higher on the news. And Tesla also had several items of good news Monday morning that has its shares moving higher. Nio hasn't come out with any specific announcements, but seems to be moving in sympathy today as investors feel it has similar prospects to its peers. Nio ET7 showing aerodynamics. Image source: Nio. Now what What's good for the EV sector is likely good for Nio. And with XPeng releasing updates for its semi-autonomous driving technology, investors likely look forward to seeing what's next from Nio. At its Tech Day over the weekend, XPeng launched the newest version of its advanced driver-assistance system, and it included a feature for autonomous city driving, as reported by CNBC. Nio has already launched its semi-autonomous Navigate on Pilot system which will compete with Tesla, and now XPeng. Nio says its system can also be used in the city in addition to highways. It also adjusts speed based on speed limits, and switches lanes based on road conditions. Investors are looking forward to the release of the company's new ET7 sedan and its assisted driving features early next year. With peer XPeng generating excitement over the weekend, and Tesla fans cheering a price raise and large 100,000 vehicle o rder from a rental car business , Nio investors seem to be bringing its shares along for the ride today.",

And the fact that Stratasys hasn't yet told us how it fared in Q3 didn't prevent the stock from surging 12.5% through 11:50 a.m. EDT on Craig-Hallum's endorsement. Image source: Getty Images. So what So what did Craig-Hallum have to say that got investors so excited? As StreetInsider.com reports, \"conversations with resellers, industry consultants, competitors and customers ... over recent weeks [have the firm feeling] more confident in the potential reaccelerating growth at Stratasys.\" Demand trends for 3-D printers \"continue to improve,\" says the analyst, and Stratasys is pioneering at least \"three new technologies\" that Craig-Hallum believes create \"potential for meaningful outperformance and upside\" in the stock \"both near term and in FY22.\" As such, it upgraded the stock from hold to buy, with a price target of $42 -- well above where it was trading even after Monday morning's jump. Now what Frustratingly, Craig-Hallum either declined to tell StreetInsider what those three new technologies are or didn't permit the reporter to disclose these specifics to those who are not among the firm's paying clients -- meaning that most investors reacting to Monday's upgrade are probably acting in the dark, and just chasing momentum . In the absence of details on what, precisely, has the analyst feeling so optimistic, I fear, investors in Stratasys today are only gambling that this company -- which hasn't earned a GAAP profit since 2012 and trades for roughly 69 times free cash flow -- is going to suddenly turn profitable again. Call me a skeptic if you like, but that seems an unwise bet to make.",

As part of Shake Shack’s chef collab series “Now Serving,” Shake Shack has joined forces with chef JJ Johnson to create a one-of-a-kind, limited-time menu for a good cause. The menu, featuring the Little J’s Burger and Curry Crunch Fries, will be available in limited quantities on Thursday, October 28 at the Shake Shack in Harlem, New York. Net proceeds from the menu will be donated to Rethink Food , a nonprofit organization with the mission to create a more sustainable and equitable food system. With programs designed to address food insecurity, use underutilized food and make sure everyone can get access to nutritious meals, Rethink has prepared over 5 million meals and directed $25M to communities and restaurants in cities like New York, Nashville and San Francisco since April 2020. Chef JJ Johnson with his special Shake Shack items Evan Sung The one day only Shake Shack collab menu is inspired by the Caribbean flavors Chef Johnson grew up with and global tastes acquired from travels. The Little J’s Burger features a gruyere cheeseburger, made with 100% Angus beef, and is topped with braised bacon, onion mayo, lettuce and tomato on a toasted potato bun. Served alongside the burger, the Curry Crunch Fries are JJ’s take on Shake Shack’s classic crispy crinkle cuts topped with the chef’s signature curry crunch. Priced at $8.49 and $3.99 respectively, the burger and fries will be available for purchase in-store, through pickup on Shake Shack’s website or delivery and pickup via the Shack app .

Shake Shack is all about the community and what better place to collaborate than with the Harlem Shake Shack, in the place I call home,” said JJ Johnson, Chef and Founder of FIELDTRIP. “I’m excited for the Harlem community to experience the FIELDTRIP flavors on the Little J burger and Curry Crunch fries. Shake Shack is beloved in my household, so this is an exciting moment for myself, FIELDTRIP, the community and my family.” The collab is the final event of Shake Shack’s “Now Serving” series, where the brand collaborated with local chefs in six cities across America, supported local organizations and created unique and delicious menu items. From Atlanta to San Francisco, and concluding in Shake Shack’s hometown of New York City, Shack fans have enjoyed items from Dominique Crenn’s Grilled Cheese to Junghyun Park’s Atoburger Shrimp Burger.

Worldcoin launched on October 21 and aims to be a universal basic income (UBI) crypto asset that gives free tokens to accounts that are verified with a biometric eye scan. The project has privacy advocates reeling and whistleblower Edward Snowden slammed the project’s creators and said “don’t catalogue eyeballs.” Worldcoin Turns Heads in the Crypto World as It Wants to Scan Your Eyeballs in Exchange for Free Crypto There’s a new cryptocurrency project that is turning heads because of the way it disperses funds to network participants. The project Worldcoin was introduced to the world by Alex Blania and Sam Altman and the team hopes to get one billion people using the crypto asset by the end of 2022. Worldcoin launched on October 21, and the founders have raised $25 million from strategic investors like Blockchange, Coinbase Ventures, Andreesen Horowitz, and Linkedin co-founder Reid Hoffman. Worldcoin is essentially a universal basic income crypto concept because the users of the network get free tokens. However, Worldcoin developers created an orb-shaped device that people have to look into in order to obtain a unique identifier. Essentially, the orb scans the person’s iris in order to create a unique identifier and verify the user. “Iris recognition ensures uniqueness, fraud resistance, and practicality,” the Worldcoin intro blog post details. Sam Altman was once the president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator and he came up with the idea two years ago. “I’ve been interested in things like universal basic income and what’s going to happen to global wealth distribution and how we can do that better, is there a way we can use technology to do that at a global scale,” Altman explained to Bloomberg last week. According to the project’s team, around 30 orbs that can scan people’s eyes and create a unique identifier are located all across the world. Worldcoin orbs can be found in France, Sudan, Indonesia, Kenya, and Chile. Worldcoin’s orbs are maintained by “Orb Operators” who get rewarded for soliciting potential Worldcoin participants. Depending on when the person got in on the project, token recipients can get between $10 and $200 worth of the digital asset worldcoin (WC). Worldcoin Described as an MLM and ICO — Worldcoin Idea Makes Edward Snowden Explain His Disdain for Biometrics Many crypto and privacy advocates have spoken out against the Worldcoin project. The CTO at Bitfinex, Paolo Ardoino, discussed a possible future with Worldcoin. “Imagine that you’re living in a cyberpunk world, with 1984 style of govt. control and worldcoin eyeball scanners at every corner of the street,” Ardoino remarked on Twitter. “Which type of apparel would you need to go around the city and protect your privacy?” the Bitfinex CTO asked. Others have said that the Worldcoin project is similar to 2017’s initial coin offering (ICO) scams. “Let me sum up how bad Worldcoin is,” an individual on Twitter stressed. “[It says] distributed ‘fairly’ yet the team gets 20% of the supply and every major VC is invested. User acquisition model imitates that of an MLM (Herbalife). Privacy policy permits them to give your data to 3rd parties. [And] the name resembles a 2017 ICO scam.” The popular whistleblower Edward Snowden scorned Sam Altman’s Worldcoin intro tweet as well. “This looks like it produces a global (hash) database of people’s iris scans (for ‘fairness’), and waves away the implications by saying ‘we deleted the scans,’” Snowden said. “Yeah, but you save the *hashes* produced by the scans. Hashes that match *future* scans. Don’t catalogue eyeballs,” Snowden added. Snowden continued his Twitter thread showing a distaste for biometrics. “Don’t use biometrics for anti-fraud,” Snowden further remarked. “In fact, don’t use biometrics for anything. ‘We use ZK-proofs.’ Great, clever. Still bad. The human body is not a ticket-punch,” he noted. What do you think about the Worldcoin project and the critics who believe the biometric iris scanning idea is not good for privacy?

To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center . To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks . A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on Oct. 18, 2021. Chris Hill: It's Monday, Oct. 18, welcome to MarketFoolery . I'm Chris Hill, with me today, Jason Moser in the house. Good to see you. Jason Moser: Good to see you. Hill: We've got big entertainment in the spotlight. We've got big retail in the spotlight, but we're going to start with housing. Shares of Zillow Group ( NASDAQ:ZG ) ( NASDAQ:Z ) down 10% this morning after the company is hitting the pause button on its homebuying service due to overwhelming demand. Zillow issued a statement saying it is quote, beyond operational capacity in the Zillow Offers business. [laughs] You can look at this and say, \"Well, this is the proverbial good problem to have, they have so much demand,\" that's great, so much demand for the homebuying service. But the fact of the matter is they're pausing this because they didn't plan correctly. They didn't staff this correctly? Moser: I think you're right, to a degree. I think the market's reaction to me at least feels like an overreaction based on what we know. This is like you said, it's it's a nice problem to have, I think actually, it's less a Zillow thing. Zillow's partly to blame here. But I think they ran into some market conditions they simply weren't anticipating and so yes, they failed to plan for a given scenario and that scenario is occurring. If you look at the release on Zillow's investor relations website, they note that operational capacity Zillow Offers to focus on signed customer contracts and current inventory, suspend signing of new contracts through 2021. So through 2021 is essentially two and a half months. It's not an issue of capital, this is an issue of them being able to not necessarily deal with the given supply chain constraints in the market and it seems like Zillow Offers itself has gained a lot of traction. If you look at the numbers just from last quarter, they purchased 3,805 homes, they sold 2,086, and that generated 777 million in revenue for their home segment. That was half of overall revenue for the quarter so it's a part of the business that I think there was a fair amount of skepticism when they launched it because iBuying was so new and they were making such a pivot. But I think generally speaking, they've done very well with it. This hopefully for them is maybe they're just being conservative here. Maybe they're just being a little cautious. We'll have to wait and see, it's not going to be that long until 2022 and we'll get a better idea of where they feel like this is going to go. But you didn't get the sense in the last conference call, that this was coming. I will say this vibe didn't exist in that last earnings call. It is a little bit surprising. Hill: As you said, we're only talking about two and a half months. Although because they are the ones who put that out there, they really need to in the next two and a half months, confirm we're starting this back up in early January 2022 because if they don't [laughs] then it does point to a larger problem than they are indicating right now. Moser: I do agree. You don't want to see this just get pushed off throughout the beginning of 2022, you'd like to see some clarity there. When you -- when you look at the market opportunity that exists, there's $1.6 trillion of real estate sold in the U.S. annually. The iBuying is a real opportunity, so you're seeing businesses like Opendoor for example. They aren't missing a beat. Now granted, their business is more founded on that particular notion, Zillow is making a little bit of a pivot. The flip side of that is, hey, if you are Zillow shareholder -- and I'm not. But if you are, you've got to feel really good about this core business that they had established years ago through the Premier Agent listings in their app. They do have more to the business than just the homes segment. But the home segment is important, you remember too it's not just homes because when you look at the lending side of their business, which is small, but it's growing. Zillow Offers business is accelerating the Zillow home loans business. They saw Zillow home loans last quarter. They saw 40 percent of purchase originations in the second quarter were sourced from those Zillow Offers. This is something where it's not just one piece of the business that's insulated, it has an impact on other parts of the business. But it's also nice they can fall back to that cool internet business that they've built out so well. Hill: Disney reports earnings on Nov. 10, but the company is getting a lot of attention in the meantime. This morning an analyst report from Barclays downgraded the stock due to slowing growth for the Disney+ streaming service. Few days ago, we had one news report that CEO Bob Chapek was reportedly tapping some of his executives to quietly explore what it would mean for Disney to spin off ESPN. What that revenue could potentially look like as well and right before we started to record this podcast, Disney announced a big shift in its movie lineup over the next couple of years, they pushed back the start dates of the next set of Marvel movies. The next Doctor Strange, the next Thor, the next Black Panther movie. They also pulled four movies off the schedule altogether. Take this in any order that you want. But I think you and I were talking right before we started recording. The movie decision is the one that seems like it has the most X factors at the moment. Moser: It feels like the movie decision is partly a result of what just has been such a fluid situation here over the past year because dealing with headwinds just from the pandemic. Now we're in the middle of the supply chain crunch and clearly having trouble getting people back to work. [Unclear] talking about the relationship between these studios and the cinemas. Like you said, there are a lot of variables that are going into that decision and I don't know that it's something that is really as critical issue for the business right now. To me, I think it's really interesting to consider this notion of spinning out ESPN. It seems reasonable to assume that growth in subscribers for Disney's streaming services is going to slow. There was a lot of pull forward of the past year and a half for obvious reasons. To see that slowdown isn't terribly surprising, basing a downgrade on that seems like telling me water's wet, we just know it. I do feel like with the ESPN decision is one that I'm really fascinated by because just a decade ago, we would talk about how ESPN was such a strength of Disney, it was such an important piece of that overall puzzle. Things are just far different now. Streaming really has become the norm for so much of our entertainment and we're seeing that pivot. For so long we were all basically unconscious subscribers to ESPN. You had one way to get your entertainment, that was through cable. You got your cable package through your provider. ESPN was a channel there whether you wanted it or not, and and ESPN ended up getting a good portion of that bill as well because of the content that it had and the general demand for its channels. Today with streaming, we subscribe with far more intent for the most part. So that starts to play out, I think on where demand for something like ESPN is going because we have so many other ways to get our sports entertainment now, it's not necessarily as conducive to streaming because it is one-time. You've got a lot of parties involved there in regard to advertising, but the price tags for this content continues to grow up, and so you look at ESPN. Maybe it's a $10 billion revenue business for Disney today. They don't really break it out, but there's some estimates out there. You could say maybe $10 billion is a reasonable revenue number to peg on it today. Those expenses continue to add up. It's becoming less and less profitable, but particularly as they have to rely more on streaming and less on the cable relationships, so it seems like over time they're just not going to pull in as much money from ESPN. Maybe it is something that frees Disney up to do other things that they did decide to spin it off. It's fascinating for me to think that 10 years ago, we would have thought this would've been like the ultimate sin spinning off ESPN. Today you can really actually start to understand better why they might do it. Hill: You can although it's hard to think about who's buying ESPN from Disney. Who has the money? Because this is not something that would be sold on the cheap. I feel like we're going to get more clues. This was a report that by the way, the company through Julia Boorstin at CNBC denied. They denied the report. But it's not an official denial from the company. Look, I've talked to Julia Boorstin a bunch of times for Motley Fool Money . She's a great reporter. I'm not disputing her source on that. But as a Disney shareholder, I want Bob Chapek to explore all aspects of the business. It makes sense that he will just say to a couple of his lieutenants, hey, just run the numbers. I just want to see what it would look like. My guess is, whatever that report ends up looking like includes the word complicated a number of times. [laughs] It will be very complicated if you think about the contracts, the live sports rights that ESPN has acquired, just taking that alone. So I think if Disney is truly going to one day spin off ESPN, we're all going to get a heads-up on that in the form of things like the next time a big live sports broadcast rights is up for grabs, ESPN sits it out. If they just say no, we're not going to lock it in the same way that we see businesses cutting costs before they are acquired by a larger business. Moser: Yeah. I absolutely agree. You just want to know. Even if nothing ever comes up, you cannot blame Mr. Chapek for taking a look at the numbers and trying to understand the case today because it is markedly different than the case a decade ago. So just understanding the fact of the matter at any given point in time. You certainly can't hold that against leadership. Spinoffs are not always bad things. Sometimes you have to get adjusted to wow, a world where Disney doesn't own ESPN, that would be crazy. Well, yeah, maybe. But I mean, I think there'll be plenty of interested parties out there that would be willing to throw their name and I mean. One that stands out to me immediately is Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) . Given the bets that it has been making recently in the entertainment industry, it would never surprise me at all to see Amazon express interest there because they have immediate distribution to 200 million-plus Prime members. So that would be an example that I think a party that could at least see a path to growth and monetization there. One thing I feel pretty safe in saying, regardless what happens if there's a deal on the table, I am certain that Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) will not be allowed to acquire it. [laughs] Because I don't think Facebook is going to be able to acquire anything for quite some time. Hill: Walmart announced a new perk for members of its Walmart+ service, early access to Black Friday deals. With more and more talk about items being out of stock this year, Walmart is looking to boost its membership. Best Buy ( NYSE:BBY ) is doing something similar with their new subscription service Totaltech. I think this is a smart move by Walmart and I also think the only way it backfires is if people sign up for it, they get the early access, and then they still don't get the items that they're looking for. Other than that, this seems like this could juice the numbers for the membership service. Moser: I think you're spot on. I think the biggest risk to this is just failure to deliver on the promise. If you tell your customers or your members or whatever, you're signing up for something special and then you don't deliver on that something special, that really is a problem. What's worse is you could just straight up lose shoppers altogether. It's someone who has been frequenting Walmart for some time, they decide to upgrade as Walmart+, then they get shafted and just a poor customer experience and they decide to try to take their business elsewhere. I don't think that'll happen. I think this makes a lot of sense. I think that when you look at Walmart, the position that they're in today, I don't think they have any real firm numbers on how big their Walmart+ membership is. But I think I saw a Deutsche Bank estimate where the membership now is around 32 million households based on surveys and estimates. You compare that to something like the Amazon Prime, which has over 200 million Prime members. Maybe that smaller member base is actually an advantage in this case because it's a little bit easier for them to deal with the logistics and get things from point A to point B and ultimately deliver on that promise. It's going to be harder to deliver on that promise for 200 million-plus people than it is for 32 million people or households. Maybe this is a really good time for them to be able to do this because they have an interesting relationship there with Walmart plus the cost is a little bit less than Amazon Prime. I think the Walmart program is $99 a year versus Prime's 119. They're getting close in price which means that they're going to have to deliver some form of value. To me, that's the biggest risk for something like this is just not being able to actually deliver on what they're promising. But I fully understand why they're doing this. To me, it makes a lot of sense. We've been praising businesses like Costco ( NASDAQ:COST ) and Amazon for a long time for running those membership models that cater to their loyal and renewing members. I think Walmart wants a piece of that action. Hill: When do you think they start sharing the numbers? It's got to be 100 million, right? Isn't 100 million the magic number where Walmart comes up and says, oh, and by the way, this is how many people we got in the service. Moser: I actually think that if this is successful, this holiday season, I think this will be something they tout in their first quarter of 2022 report when they report this holiday quarter. If it performs well, say it bumps them the 50 million or whatever, I think they'd like to brag on those firm numbers sooner rather than later. Hill: Jason Moser, great talking to you. Thanks for being here. Moser: Thank you. Hill: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to do it for this edition of MarketFoolery . The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening.

Those valuations drop using expected long-term metals prices, but investors still were impressed by the potential project returns for the 20-year open pit mining project. But the reaction to those details were also likely tempered by the fact that the project still remains in limbo waiting for resolution of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review as well as ongoing lawsuit. Now what Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen said in a statement, \"The 2021 PEA forecasts strong economics for the Proposed Project and also demonstrates significant optionality for future potential developments.\" He added that the company has made investments to ensure the project can be constructed and operated using \"industry-leading environmental safeguards.\" But that alone won't get the project moving. Northern Dynasty wants the EPA to more quickly decide whether it will proceed with a proposed determination review over the project's impacts to the nearby Bristol Bay watershed. The agency had previously withdrawn the review process, but subsequently decided to proceed with it. Northern Dynasty believes that it has already complied with concerns the agency has expressed and that it has included proper protections for the project to proceed. But until the regulatory and legal process is completed, Northern Dynasty shares will remain at the whim of that process. For today, the economic benefits expected from the project have some investors willing to take on that risk.",

As of 11:20 a.m. EDT, Gevo shares are trading up 5.5%. So what Gevo is a renewable energy start-up that's producing low-carbon gasoline and jet fuel from feedstock like corn. Gevo's Net-Zero projects aim to produce liquid hydrocarbons using renewable sources of energy like wind, biogas, and renewable natural gas that could emit net zero greenhouse gas emissions when used in engines. Image source: Getty Images. Monday morning, Gevo signed a memorandum of understanding with ADM under which it will process about 900 million gallons of ethanol produced at ADM's dry mills in Columbus, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois to produce nearly 500 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ADM stated that 900 million gallons represents more than half its production capacity and that its entry into SAF is among the many moves it's making to decarbonize. Gevo could potentially start producing SAF with ADM by 2025-2026 if the companies enter into definitive agreements as planned. Now what ADM's deal means Gevo's potential contract pipeline has now crossed a whopping 1 billion gallons. Gevo has already signed jet fuel take-or-pay contracts with some well-known names like Delta Airlines and TotalEnergies and secured contracts worth 54 million gallons per year. In September, Gevo even received a patent in the U.S. for its process of converting ethanol and other bio-based alcohols into \"drop-in, bio-based diesel and jet fuel products.\" Even after today's jump, Gevo's stock is trading almost 60% below its 52-week highs of $15.57 a share. So although developments like today's can drive the stock higher in the short term, Gevo will have to convert its pipeline into definitive contracts faster to develop conviction in the stock among investors in renewable energy, especially given its dizzying market capitalization of almost $1.4 billion despite its being years away from commercial production.",

[+] experience enormous transformation, new research brings fresh insight for brands looking to create effective customer experiences and boost sales. getty With the two year anniversary of the pandemic nearing, and the retail industry continuing to experience enormous transformation, new research brings fresh insight for brands looking to create effective customer experiences and boost sales. A new survey by Birdeye , an Experience Marketing platform, of over 800 marketers, looked specifically at how they communicate with new and existing customers to grow their revenue. The report showed how 57% of those surveyed now believe that managing the online reputation of a business, through actively managing reviews, referrals and other indicators of online reputation, is more important than paying for advertising. Advertising becomes more complex With the impact of the ios14 changes coming into full force this year, many retailers have been looking for more ways to maximise their online sales. Dave Lehman, chief operating officer of Birdeye, states that “Advertising just isn’t driving revenue the way it used to,” and makes this recommendation to any e-commerce business concerned about falling ad revenues: \"Keep investing in advertising, but devote more time and resources to building a strong online reputation. There’s no one marketing strategy that is a golden goose”. The report backs up this advice, and shows that many marketers have already made this change, with 88% of marketers see a direct connection between online reputation and revenue. Lehman goes further to say “the best first step towards building an effective online reputation is to accelerate digital transformation”. MORE FOR YOU ‘No Christmas Trees, No Christmas Trees’ Another Shortage May Be On The Way The Grocery Business Is Going To Get Much More Competitive Costco Addresses Supply Chain Pains By Chartering Their Own Ships “The decision to go digital is no longer optional. The pandemic forced many businesses to accelerate their digital transformation over the past year — much faster than planned...Overall, digital transformation has sped up by a shocking 7 years”. How to build an online reputation “To truly build a good online reputation, make sure you ask all your customers for feedback and don’t cherry-pick customers. Getting continuous feedback from customers, and responding to them, is essential for building authenticity and trust with your audience” explains Lehman. Small businesses in many ways have an advantage to managing their online reputation in comparison to the bigger retailers. Small business owners are closer to their customers, so if they work hard to connect with customers and utilise the online platforms afforded to them - the building blocks for a positive online reputation are there. The report reminds us that right now, consumers are attracted to brands that offer “simplicity, speed and convenience whenever they need a question answered or a problem solved” and they prefer ‘messaging’ as the main method for communication. Utilising the direct relationship they have with customers is the ‘holy grail’ for small businesses. Being brave and taking advantage of the advancement of technology will stand independent retailers in good stead during challenging and competitive times. Despite lacking the scalability of advertising, online reputation management is a crucial tool in the marketers toolbox, with 58% of new customers coming to brands through SEO and reviews (responsible for 34% of new acquisitions), and referrals (24%). Ultimately, the growing importance of building a solid online reputation simply reinformes what many independent retailers know. As Birdeye concludes: “Today, online sentiment, customer referrals and word of mouth have become the largest influence on the purchase process...customers are the lifeblood of any business and significantly impact search results and online reputation”.",

So what Granted, that was only a pro forma number. Actual earnings when calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) were only $0.23 per share. And MagnaChip's sales inched only up 1.8% year over year in Q3 2021. The company's display solutions sales were especially weak, falling nearly 16% year over year, a fact the company attributed to \"limited ... foundry capacity allocation amid global shortages in manufacturing capacities.\" On the plus side, the company's gross profit margin on those sales grew by more than half to 36.7%, hitting \"the highest level reported in the company's history.\" Now what The really bad news for MagnaChip investors, I fear, is that management says its \"supply constraint is expected to persist for the foreseeable future,\" limiting its ability to grow revenue to which those strong gross margin numbers can be applied. MagnaChip management didn't provide investors guidance on precisely how bad things could look later this year, but analysts are still forecasting a sizable falloff in revenue for the fourth quarter (down 7%) and an even bigger decline in earnings (down more than 40%).",

While over short periods of time one asset class or another may outperform stocks, the long-term results prove that if you want to accumulate large amounts of wealth, investing in stocks is the way to go. Last year Deutsche Bank published a study showing that over the past 100 years, equities beat out gold by 5.6% per year, housing prices by 6.6%, Treasuries by 6.8%, and oil by 8.4% per year. Image source: Getty Images. There have been only two decades when stocks have had negative returns: the Great Depression of the 1930s and the 2000s when a combination of the Tech Wreck, 9/11, and the housing bubble bursting all conspired to sink the market, causing negative returns of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. It's clear that for investors wanting the best chance of having a comfortable retirement, investing in stocks and staying in the market for the long haul is the correct strategy. That's why the nuggets of investing wisdom that says \"it's not about timing the market, but your time in the market\" is so true. By the time working Americans are ready for their gold watch, the following pair of winning stocks have the potential to make those who invested wealthy. Image source: Getty Images. AGNC Investment Corp Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by the likes Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae are the key investments for agency mortgage REITs like AGNC Investment Corp ( NASDAQ:AGNC ) . It doesn't originate mortgages, but rather buys and sells packaged government-backed MBSs from the so-called agencies (hence the acronym of its name). That means AGNC doesn't really have credit risk, as mortgage deals of this type are very safe. Yet it does have interest rate risk and prepayment risk. Through Federal Reserve policies that keep interest rates artificially low, homeowners are induced to refinance their higher-rate mortgages for those sporting lower rates. Last year, low interest rates especially encouraged homeowners to refinance and pay off their higher-rate mortgages early, which caused AGNC's constant prepayment rate (CPR), or the percentage of AGNC's portfolio it expects to be paid off within a year, to jump 60% in 2020 to 17.6%. A lower CPR is better, because a loan that's paid off doesn't produce interest for its holder, which can lead to lower rates of return. However, as mortgage interest rates rose half a percentage point this year, AGNC's projected CPR fell to 11.6% at the end of June. That should continue as the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen 20 basis points over the past 30 days and is now at its highest level since April. Also, applications to refinance mortgages are 22% lower year over year. AGNC trades at a roughly 5% discount to its June 30 book value per share of $17.39, and with a dividend currently yielding 8.7% annually based on today's stock price, this mREIT offers investors potential for capital appreciation and a steady stream of income. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's Lowe's ( NYSE:LOW ) is benefiting from a seller's housing market. While rising mortgage interest rates may start to cool sales -- there are indications that's actually happening as mortgage applications to buy a home are down 12% year over year -- the home improvement center will simply benefit from consumers choosing to spruce up their existing digs, just as they did at the start of the pandemic. Lowe's isn't a win-win stock per se, one that will gain regardless of which way the economy goes. It's much more resilient, and over the long haul has proven to be an exceptional investment. There's not much to suggest it won't continue to be, even as consumers try to adjust to runaway inflation that's sending prices of lumber, building materials, and most home goods to record levels. Lowe's has long catered to the homeowner over the professional, while rival Home Depot is doing just the opposite. Yet several years ago Lowe's began an intensive effort to lure contractors in, and that effort has paid off. Professionals now account for 20% to 25% of its total sales (they represent about 45% of Home Depot's total). With the home improvement market estimated to be $900 billion, split 50-50 between consumers and contractors, increasing its penetration into the professional market by just a little (not even achieving parity with Home Depot) ought to generate tens of millions of dollars a year more in sales. Even though Lowe's stock is at record highs right now, it still trades for only about 18 times next year's earnings estimates, which is right around what Wall Street forecasts the DIY center's long-term earnings growth rate is. It also pays a dividend that yields a modest 1.4% annually, a payout it has made every quarter since it went public in 1961. In fact, Lowe's has raised its dividend for 56 consecutive years, putting it in the rarefied group of stocks known as Dividend Kings and one investors should consider holding on to well into their retirement years.",

So what Skillz has been on a long downward slide with the stock losing more than three-quarters of its value after soaring to over $46 per share during the meme stock trading frenzy back in February. While there were some sharp plunges along the way, it was more of an inexorable path lower until it bottomed out at just under $8 per share earlier this month. Image source: Getty Images. Since then, Skillz stock has climbed nearly 40%, though at around $11 a stub it remains severely depressed. Yet that's in spite of the potential it holds. Esports is a fast growing niche in the overall gaming market and Skillz position in the real sweet spot of e-gaming, which is betting on online gameplay. Skillz enables users to wager real money on mobile games played during tournaments and competitions and to play games with non-monetary stakes. Now what The esports platform remains under pressure and heavily shorted, with over 555 million shares sold short at last count. That's an amount equal to about 23% of all of Skillz shares outstanding. That could help explain the boost the stock's price is getting as a rise in value could be causing short-sellers to cover their positions leading to the stock going up and pushing more shorts to cover. This might not be a short squeeze that sends Skillz stock soaring again, but it may shake out enough shorts to get shares back up to a level that's more appropriate for its potential.",

[+] Indiana Pacers during an NBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler) ASSOCIATED PRESS Somewhere in between the Snarl and the sweep, things began to turn for Tyler Herro, the Miami Heat guard that just started his third season in the NBA. As a rookie from the University of Kentucky, he exceeded the expectations of a late-lottery draft pick. He showed a willingness to take clutch shots - and the ability to knock those down - and was a valuable contributor to a team that itself exceeded expectations by reaching the NBA Finals in Orlando. That seems as likely a starting point as any for when things started going wrong for Herro. Miami’s run in the Orlando “bubble” changed the team’s timeline completely. The plan after adding Jimmy Butler in 2019 was to build more slowly, bank on internal development of young players and look to add a superstar in the 2021 offseason. But a Finals run changed that; they were further along than expected, but not in the top-tier of Eastern Conference teams, at least in terms of overall talent. In the short between between Orlando and the start of the 2020-2021 season, they had to choose a path. Several contributing players were entering free agency. Miami looked to retain them on one-year deals. That way, the team could reload for another improbable run while still maintaining flexibility for 2021, when players like Giannis Antetokounmpo or Kawhi Leonard could be entering free agency. It was a risky move. And it didn’t work. Jae Crowder and Derrick Jones, Jr. took multi-year deals elsewhere. Miami re-signed Goran Dragic and Meyers Leonard to hefty two-year deals that included a team option for the second season. Solomon Hill joined a divisional rival in Atlanta. A team that had peaked earlier than expected, that thrived on team chemistry and defensive versatility, lost key players that had contributed both tangibly and intangibly to that success. As for Herro, his chances of evolving in between his first and second year were hindered by the shortened offseason. His role, too, was in a state of flux. Herro started the first 10 games of the season, missed time with injury, started four games and would resume a bench role for the rest of season. Herro’s name was linked in the trade rumor du jour , from James Harden to Victor Oladipo to Kyle Lowry. Miami’s roster, like 29 others around the league, would also be impacted by COVID-19 and injury, and consistency was unlikely to be built on a foundation inherently designed to crumble.

While his 3-point shooting dipped between Year 1 and 2 (from 38.9 to 36.0 percent), he also improved from everywhere else on the floor, while also making strides as an occasional playmaker and surprisingly good rebounder. There’s obvious weaknesses, mostly defensively, but those were evident as a rookie and yet fans appreciated Herro despite them. The offseason represented a turning point for Herro. The coaching staff tasked him with a goal to put on weight, to better absorb contract as he made his occasional forays toward the rim and to improve on his defensive limitations. He achieved that goal, reporting to camp this year looking noticeably stronger. Through the first two games of the regular season, the work has clearly played off. Herro is currently ranked 8th in the NBA in total scoring at 28.5 points per game, providing a needed boost off the bench for a team that many pundits believed would struggle offensively. His long-range shooting is still less-than-ideal (at 35.0 percent on 10 attempts per game), but Herro has grown comfortable with his role as the team’s Sixth Man. Herro has been quick to point to Miami’s addition of Lowry as a reason for his growth but on Oct. 23, in an overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers, Lowry sat out the game and Herro still notched 30 points to lead the team. This was the Herro that Heat fans had grown to appreciate, sure of himself and willing to create points for himself when Miami’s offense struggled without Lowry’s on-the-floor guidance. This is the role that seems best suited for Herro, even if fans struggle to understand it’s significance. Miami’s is once again on a championship track. The addition of Lowry and P.J. Tucker are win-now moves with little regard for the future. They provide defensive versatility, veteran leadership and championship experience. Butler and Bam Adebayo, the team’s star duo, area All-NBA defenders, underrated playmakers and capable scorers. If there’s a concern there, it’s that they do everything well and are expected to carry a heavier load. Herro, for his part, just has to be what he’s been most effective in his brief NBA tenure; a bucket getter that doesn’t make too many mistakes in other aspects of the game. The disconnect with how important Herro’s role is lies in the contrast with his more accomplished teammates. On a team built on versatility, both offensively and defensively, Herro’s greatest strength is perceived as a weakness. But the reality is that Herro, at least for this season, doesn’t have to be a multi-dimensional star. While fans and outside observers question whether the Heat should look to trade Herro, consider what might any deal might net in return. Of the superstars most frequently rumored to be involved in proposed trades - Damian Lillard? Bradley Beal? - which one would provide the same value as Herro? While those stars would be an upgrade, the cost of acquiring them is beyond what Miami can reasonably afford. And for those still focused on Miami’s inability to acquire Harden in a trade last season, reports are pretty clear that it had nothing to do with the team’s unwillingness to include Herro in the deal but rather that they just lacked sufficient draft capital to make a palatable deal for the Rockets. Miami wisely held onto Herro rather than include him in a reported mid-season trade to acquire Lowry that obviously fell through. Just months later, Lowry and Herro are both on the roster, as is Duncan Robinson (who was also rumored to be on Toronto’s wish list). Herro may or may not expand his role, or become an All-Star. Those questions can wait. For now, at just 21 years old and as a potent scorer, his role on a veteran-laden team is clearly defined and he is thriving in it. He is exactly where and what he should be.",

    "content": "The telecom regulator has issued a consultation paper on cable TV services in the country, for which it has sought views from various stakeholders.The paper, released on Oct. 25, seeks views on monopoly, market dominance and competition in the sector, as the government has said recommendations issued by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eight years ago need to be reviewed given the changes in the media and entertainment sector.In November 2013, TRAI had issued its recommendations on monopoly or market dominance in cable TV services after the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting sought to bring in reasonable restrictions on multi-system operators and local cable operators as cable TV distribution was monopolised in some states.Since then, the sector has changed drastically, particularly with the advent of new digital technologies. As a result, the ministry asked the regulator to provide a fresh set of recommendations in the matter.“The M&E sector grew from Rs 1.03 lakh crore in 2014 to Rs 1.38 lakh crore in 2020,” the consultation paper stated. “The multiple platforms have also ensured a competitive market leading to affordability. At an average price of around $5.5, Indian consumer pays around 20 to 25% as compared to a TV consumer in U.K., U.S., Thailand or Malaysia.”An estimated 18.41 crore households are being served by the cable TV services, Direct-To-Home services, Headend in the Sky services, Internet Protocol television services in addition to a terrestrial TV network of Doordarshan as on March 2021, the paper said.

    "full_description": "Two ad tech companies, Rubicon Project and Telaria, merged to create a new company called Magnite ( NASDAQ:MGNI ) last April. If you had invested $1,000 in Magnite's stock right after the merger closed, your stake would be worth over $5,500 today. It would also have been worth as much as $13,700 back in February before its rally ran out of steam. Let's take a look back at Magnite's meteoric rise, its year-long decline, and where this divisive ad tech stock might be headed in the future. Image source: Getty Images. Why did Rubicon merge with Telaria? Rubicon provided programmatic ads for mobile devices and PCs, while Telaria developed a software platform for managing ads for streaming video and connected TV (CTV) platforms. Rubicon wanted to diversify into the CTV market to reduce its dependence on mobile and PC ads, while Telaria needed Rubicon's programmatic technologies to reach more ad sellers. Merging the two companies introduced Magnite as the world's largest independent SSP (sell-side platform). SSPs help media owners manage and sell their ad inventories, and sit on the opposite end of the ad supply chain as DSPs (demand-side platforms) like The Trade Desk , which let buyers bid on those ad inventories. Earlier this year, Magnite bought two additional CTV companies, SpotX and SpringServe, to further accelerate the expansion of its CTV business. Why did Magnite's stock initially skyrocket? Magnite's stock initially soared for four main reasons. First, the company's combined revenue growth looked very impressive. Its revenue surged 42% to $221.6 million in 2020. Its desktop revenue rose 16% to $79 million, its mobile revenue rose 23% to $108.4 million, and its new CTV business generated $34.3 million in revenue. Second, its combined profits were rising. Its adjusted EBITDA margin rose three percentage points year over year to 19% in 2020, while its adjusted EBITDA increased 68% to $43.1 million. Third, investors were dazzled by the growth potential of the CTV market, which would benefit from the slow death of \"linear TV\" platforms like cable and satellite TV. eMarketer expects spending on CTV ads in the U.S. to jump from $9.03 billion in 2020 to $24.76 billion in 2024, and companies like Magnite and Roku are well-positioned to profit from that secular trend. Lastly, Magnite's stock initially seemed cheap relative to its growth. In early April, Magnite only had a market cap of about $500 million -- just over two times the revenue it would eventually generate in 2020. Why did Magnite's rally end? Magnite gained more attention in early 2021, then skyrocketed to an all-time high of $64.39 during the Reddit-fueled buying frenzy in February. Magnite's market cap briefly topped $7 billion, or 17 times this year's sales, before that unsustainable rally fizzled out. The stock subsequently declined to the mid-$20s by May as the company faced three new concerns. First, Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) rolled out a controversial iOS update that allowed its users to opt out of data-mining features and targeted ads. Second, Alphabet 's ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) Google announced it would ban all third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. Those two platform changes raised red flags for Magnite's mobile and PC businesses, respectively, and put more pressure on its CTV business to expand. Google postponed its cookie ban to 2023 in June, but Apple's changes are already generating some brutal headwinds for some mobile advertisers . Second, investors realized that Magnite was relying heavily on acquisitions, like SpotX and SpringServe, to boost its revenue. Here's how wide the gap was between its reported revenue, which includes those acquisitions, and its pro forma revenue, which excludes them, in the first half of 2021: Revenue Growth (YOY) Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Reported 67% 170% Pro-forma 18% 79%* Source: Magnite. YOY = Year-over-year. *Excluding traffic acquisition costs. Magnite's change in reporting its revenue on an ex-TAC (excluding traffic acquisition) basis in the second quarter -- which it believes is a better gauge of its growth after the SpotX acquisition -- further confused investors. Lastly, it's unclear if Magnite's stock is still a worthwhile investment at eight times this year's sales . Analysts expect its revenue to rise 90% this year, but most of that growth will be inorganic. Next year they expect its revenue to increase 31% -- but it's still unclear if the slower growth of its mobile and desktop businesses will offset the expansion of its CTV business. I still believe in Magnite's growth potential Magnite's business model can be confusing, but investors should tune out the noise and notice its CTV business generated 29% of its ex-TAC revenue in the first half of 2021 -- up from just 10% in the first half of 2020. That percentage will likely continue rising and offset its potential challenges in the mobile and desktop markets. The road ahead could be bumpy, but Magnite still plans to grow its annual revenue by about 25% over the next few years, while potentially doubling its adjusted EBITDA margins -- so its stock could still have plenty of upside potential for patient investors.",

    "full_description": "Just four months after Grubhub was acquired by a Dutch company, an investor says Grubhub is a dud that needs to go. On Monday, Cat Rock Capital Management sent a letter to the board of Just Eat Takeaway.com — the Netherlands-based company that bought Grubhub in June — telling the conglomerate that Grubhub is dragging it down and “is the root cause of the public market’s loss of confidence in JET.” Earlier this month, Grubhub founder Matt Maloney said he is stepping down from JET’s board in December to “pursue other opportunities.” Cat Rock Capital, a Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund, has been an investor in JET for the past four years and has a 6.5 percent stake, according to the letter. Cat Rock’s founder and managing partner, Alex Captain, writes that the Grubhub acquisition clipped JET’s wings and is the sole reason the European conglomerate’s growth has petered out. “JET’s outperformance evaporated when it announced the Grubhub acquisition in June 2020, with the stock falling over 18 percent in the four trading days after the announcement,” according to the letter. What’s more, JET management is “distracted” by Grubhub, which has “caused investors to question JET management’s judgement and motivations,” Captain writes. JET’s “deeply depressed valuation” leaves it vulnerable to takeover bids, according to the letter. Captain urges JET to sell Grubhub or spin it off and suggests that Walmart, Amazon or Instacart are likely buyers as they look to beef up their grocery delivery businesses. If JET doesn’t take steps to dump Grubhub before the end of the year, Captain warns, Cat Rock and “other investors” will take “additional action.” Grubhub has been losing market share in its biggest markets, including New York City, to rivals Doordash and Uber Eats, as The Post has reported, and it is under considerable regulatory scrutiny in cities and states that have passed legislation aimed at cubing delivery companies’ fees from restaurants. JET, for its part, acknowledged Grubhub’s “specific challenges today,” in a statement, but insisted that its it’s poised for growth. “It is a large and growing business with good underlying profitability,” according to the statement adding “over time, it will be a participant in the consolidation of the wider US market as various players combine to optimise last mile delivery. The Just Eat Takeaway.com management team expects to be involved in this consolidation when it comes and intends to do so from a position of strength that reflects the strategic value of Grubhub.”",

Multiple analysts downgraded the stock , cut its price target, or warned of production cuts -- or some combination of the three -- but as StreetInsider.com reported today, one analyst in particular argues that Micron stock could defy the bad news and double in price. Shares of Micron are up 2.5% as of 10:40 a.m. EDT. Image source: Getty Images. So what But let's start with the bad news. According to TheFly.com, this morning analysts at Bernstein initiated coverage of Micron with an underperform ( i.e., sell ) rating on worries that a \"downcycle\" in computer memory demand and pricing has begun, and that it will extend through late 2022, limiting the stock's upside potential. Echoing those fears, Cleveland Research warned of \"softer\" average selling prices for DRAM memory in the November quarter, and predicted a similar decline in demand for and pricing of NAND memory in Q1. Topping this all off, Evercore ISI speculated that a 6.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Taiwan over the weekend may have hurt Micron's Taoyuan facility, which churns out one-third of the company's DRAM chips. Now what That's the bad news. Now here's the good: Defying all this negativity above, Needham & Co. just put out a report praising Micron's plan to spend $150 billion increasing its production capacity over the next 10 years. While some analysts fear that such a large investment will result in massive oversupply for production capacity in the memory market, Needham argues that \"Micron's capacity would rise at [only] a CAGR of 2.1% over the next 10 years.\" And given \"robust ... demand for DRAM and NAND ... thanks to secular drivers such as 5G and the proliferation of AI,\" the analyst doesn't think this small rate of capacity expansion will be enough to drown the market in memory chips and crash memory prices. To the contrary, Needham argues that Micron is making the right move at the right time -- and that its stock could nearly double to $130 a share within a year because of it.",

The company's private equity backer has signed off on the deal, which means the odds are good PAE will soon be taken private. So what PAE, short for Pacific Architects and Engineers, provides services for the CIA, the U.S. military, civil services, and foreign governments. The company on Monday said it has agreed to be acquired by privately held Amentum Government Services Holdings in an all-cash deal that values it at about $1.9 billion, including the assumption of debt. Terms of the deal call for PAE holders to receive $10.05 per share in cash when the deal is completed, a premium of 70% over PAE's Friday close. The stock is moving higher as a result. Image source: Getty Images. The two companies know each other well. Amentum recently beat out PAE for a $1.3 billion contract to maintain aircraft for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency. In a statement, PAE interim president Charlie Peiffer said the deal \"will benefit the customers and employees of both companies\" by expanding their capabilities. \"Aided by an attractive demand environment and PAE's diversification across its customer base, contract portfolio and geographic reach, combining with Amentum is expected to provide our customers a wide array of capabilities and services via a broad range of contracting vehicles,\" Peiffer said. \"Furthermore, this transaction should provide strong growth opportunities in terms of career development for our employees.\" Now what An affiliate of Platinum Equity, which holds about 22.5% of PAE shares, has entered into an agreement to vote its shares in accordance with the PAE board's recommendation, a big step toward making sure the deal does close as planned. The only question is whether someone else will step in with a higher offer: PAE has until Nov. 29, 2021, to solicit alternative acquisition proposals and will have to pay a breakup fee should it find a better offer. Given the premium, investors shouldn't bank on a better deal coming along. But there are a lot of government services flush with cash right now and looking for deals. If nothing else, this deal might suggest investors are undervaluing the government services sector, setting up the possibility we might see other deals for related companies in the quarters to come.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The floor of the chemical factory in Northeast Ohio has looked about the same for decades. Like soldiers in formation, containers come off the assembly line—ranging from little bottles to 5-gallon carboys—and workers transfer them into carts and boxes as fast as humanly possible. It’s monotonous work at best, and it can be backbreaking when 40-pound jugs are rolling off the line. But soon, a new team member is primed to shake things up—and, hopefully, make things better. That team member is a collaborative robot, or cobot, designed to enable the human workers to take on higher-value tasks. For years , cobots have been shown to make manufacturing processes faster and more efficient, but research shows that fewer than 10% of manufacturers use them. Among those not using cobots was the chemical company mentioned above, which wasn’t initially inclined to bet big on new technology when the status quo was largely good enough. That’s why a “rent-a-robot” model—which is gaining steam across the country —made so much sense. “Given today’s increasingly tight labor market, more manufacturers should explore these models,” said Mike O’Donnell, my colleague and vice president at MAGNET, who worked with the chemical company noted above. “As the industrial ecosystem adjusts to the labor crunch, companies placing orders will seek out manufacturers with human-robot integration as the best way to ramp up production.” Beyond that, there is relatively little risk associated with renting robots—and the underlying technology has made important strides in recent years. Why Renting Provides Flexibility Over the years, the owners of the chemical company grew their business from a regional player in the Midwest to a national operation, with more than 200 employees and a loyal customer base. Revenue was good, but margins were getting tighter, and staffing was becoming more of a challenge.

Mantle’s Printed Tooling Powers Mass Production To continue succeeding at a high level amid increasing global competition and a declining labor force, company leaders figured something needed to change. That’s what got them initially interested in robotics and automation and, eventually, the rent-a-robot model. Vendors, some backed by venture capital, lease robots to SMEs, install and maintain them and bill by the hour or month. With no upfront investment, much of the financial risk is removed, with the potential for immediate savings by way of improved efficiency. Leasing provides flexibility—financially and operationally—that wouldn’t exist if manufacturers bought robots or spent time and money developing their own. The model also puts pressure on the lessor to make sure their products are performing on the factory floor. Companies can test out the latest technology without being married to it and send it back if it’s not meeting their expectations or goals. On the flip side, if things go really well there’s often a lease-to-buy option. Technological Advancements Have Made Robots Smarter, Faster And Cheaper Thanks to technology, robots have become easier to integrate onto factory floors, capable of more advanced tasks and less costly to produce—all of which support the viability of the burgeoning rent-a-robot trend. A McKinsey study found that the average robot price has “fallen by half in real terms, and even further relative to labor costs” in the past few decades. At the same time, strides in software development, computing power and networking technologies have shrunk the cost of installing and maintaining such machines. For instance, new plug-and-play technologies can connect various components using simpler network wiring than ever. And automated sensors can help collect data for maintenance and aid in improvement and troubleshooting efforts. What’s more, today’s robots— powered by machine vision, AI and deep reinforcement learning—offer manufacturers new capabilities that can drive efficiency and further lower costs. Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) can now coordinate to move materials—like those on the chemical factory’s assembly line—from one location to another, ensuring that each machine is assigned to the right trip, doesn’t collide with other machines and remains charged throughout. TORRANCE, CA - OCTOBER 04: Hawthorne High School senior Cameron Hartley watches a robot during a ... [+] tour of the Pelican Product Inc. manufacturing facility in Torrance on Friday, October 4, 2019. The event is designed to encourage new talent and emphasize the possibilities that a background in engineering and robotics provides as well as celebrate the annual National Association of Manufacturers\"u2019 Manufacturing Day. The students were able to see a working production business and they got a chance to test their skills in assembling a flashlight and a six-foot egg drop using a Pelican container and foam.(Photo by Brittany Murray/MediaNews Group/Long Beach Press-Telegram via Getty Images) MediaNews Group via Getty Images Helping SMEs Overcome Their Concerns Some critics might point to so-called robot graveyards—i.e., collections of machines that have failed to pay dividends in the past that are now gathering dust on factory floors. That’s wrongheaded given how far the technology has come and the obvious benefits of renting. But leasing robots—and getting them to work for you—isn’t without challenges, including how to pay for the technology. Of course, it’s not just about money. The leaders of the chemical company mentioned above, for example, had a multistate operation to run—orders to fill, people to hire, potential customers to host, reports to complete and plenty of troubles to shoot without creating new ones. They simply didn’t have time to develop their own robot systems or explore options of getting them from an outside vendor. My organization, one of many regional Manufacturing Extension Partnerships across the country, helped them find vendors, made introductions and even ironed out deal terms. “It’s important for organizations like ours to serve this role and for companies to seek out this kind of assistance,” O’Donnell said. “It can be daunting to take the first step if you’re a company that has done things the same way—and succeeded—for years or decades. So working with a third party you can trust to fill in some blanks can really make a difference.” These first rent-a-robot deals might be relatively modest—often just one robot to start. But they can be an important first step toward increasing efficiency and competitiveness in the short term and building confidence in automation as new technologies emerge. The technology should also be implemented in tandem with higher wages. Smart manufacturing roles pay an average of $12,000 more a year than more traditional manufacturing jobs. Robots won’t and shouldn’t fully replace humans in factories, but they make operations more efficient, which in turn helps justify higher wages and training costs necessary to remain competitive. That’s important in combatting the turnover and job-hopping that is bedeviling most companies across the country—chief among them, manufacturers.",

Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean ( NYSE:RCL ) tend to land slightly higher on the pricing spectrum. Image source: Getty Images. Passing ships Ainley downgrading Carnival stock from buy to neutral -- while slashing his price target from $34 to $24.50 -- isn't a call to sell the stock. However, downgrading the shares on the same day he initiates coverage of Norwegian Cruise Line with a buy rating is clearly a mandate on where he feels investors should place their recovery bets. His fresh $39 price target on Norwegian Cruise Line represents a hefty 53% gain from where the shares started the week. The lower-price goal on Carnival is just 10% higher than where the stock was at the end of last week. It's not just the market favoring premium cruise brands at the moment, a call that would also seem to favor Royal Caribbean even if Ainley's Monday moves centered around the country's largest and third-largest cruise line operators. Pitting Norwegian to Carnival finds the former better positioned in terms of ship pipeline, earnings quality, and valuation at this point. Carnival has taken a more defensive approach , unloading some of the older ships on its fleet. Carnival also has fewer new ships on the way as a percentage of its current fleet. There's no denying that the cruising industry has had a challenging restart process. Plans to start sailing again this summer that seemed so ambitious earlier this year proved problematic as the peak travel season played out. However, after a brutal 2020 for the industry, one would think that the three cruise line stocks would be beneficiaries of pandemic-tackling vaccinations that became widely available in 2021. It hasn't worked out that way, and all but Royal Caribbean have been treading water in terms of year-to-date shareholder gains. Royal Caribbean is up 13.3% this year. Carnival stock climbed 2.9% in 2021. Norwegian Cruise Line has inched 0.2% higher. Royal Caribbean was the top gainer last year, too. The climate is getting kinder. Regulatory hurdles have been largely cleared now. International travel restrictions are starting to ease as global vaccination rates improve and active COVID-19 case counts recede. It's not necessarily smooth sailing for the cruise line stocks . We've seen some false starts in the pandemic's recovery process. However, next summer will likely be far kinder to the industry than this deficit-saddled year. The water may still be rough, but the long-term prospects for all three cruise lines are promising.",

[+] Field, and Montreal. (Photo by J. Meric/Getty Images) Getty Images When the Tampa Bay Rays floated the concept of having the team play half their season in Montreal was first raised, few took the idea seriously. Now, that proposal has taken on more life as the Rays go on a PR quest to make it happen. The union for the players will ultimately decide whether it becomes something more than a concept. The idea, touted publicly again earlier in the month by Rays president Brian Auld, would be for both St. Petersburg and Montreal to both build open-air ballparks that would see the team play the first part of the season in St. Pete, while the second half would be played in Montreal with team owner Stu Sternberg discussing the concept last year: While Sternberg may publicly say that he’s “committed to keeping baseball in Tampa Bay for generations to come,” the actions by the club paint a picture of working markets against each other to satisfy not only the Rays but potentially MLB. The Rays are going to throw Montreal into the mix to leverage St. Pete or the larger Tampa Bay area in the hopes of extracting a new ballpark. If they are unable to do so, and Montreal does, the team eventually relocates after exiting their current lease agreement that expires in 2027. Should both markets come up with ballparks, then the club remains the Tampa Bay Rays, and Montreal gets awarded an expansion team. The rhetoric around getting a ballpark built in the Rays’ current home market increased earlier this month when Auld addressed a sizable crowd for the weekly Café con Tampa speaker series. “We don’t have a lot of time,” Auld said, referencing the Rays lease on their current home, Tropicana Field expires. “We’ve concluded that it’s next to impossible that full-season baseball can succeed in Tampa Bay today.” Recommended For You 1 WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon More stories like this Fewer stories like this 2 The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi More stories like this Fewer stories like this 3 The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers More stories like this Fewer stories like this The Rays also jumped the gun with what was not only bad marketing but an impossibility at this time when plans were leaked that the club planned on putting a sign in right field of Tropicana Field just before this year’s playoffs promoting the sister-city plan of splitting between their current home and Montreal. Sternberg pulled back from the plan saying that backlash was the cause. “I made a big mistake, a real mistake, in trying to promote our sister-city plan with a sign right now in our home ballpark,” Sternberg said in a radio interview . “I absolutely should have known better. And really, I’m sorry for that. I’m here to tell you and tell the fans that the sign is not going to go up.” But looking closely, the real reason the sign may not have gone up has as much to do with labor matters that affect the players in Major League Baseball. Whether the Rays and the league wish to have the Rays play a split-season, or not, rests upon approval from the MLB Players Association. This is for good reasons. Players on the Rays roster would find themselves having to live half the season across the border in Canada. Families would be uprooted. Travel changes, and not only for the Rays’ players, but all visiting teams, as well, that now have to travel into Canada for not only games against the Toronto Blue Jays, but the “Tampa Bay” Rays playing in Montreal. As of now, the concept of the Rays playing a split-season has been nothing more than a proposal to the MLBPA as part of bargaining rounds as the expiration of the current labor agreement is set to expire on Dec. 1st. For the MLBPA to approve such a plan, certainly additional compensation to the Rays’ players would be part of the discussion. The union for the players could also use it as additional leverage for concessions with MLB’s owners. The latter may not go over well with MLB’s 29 other owners. As part of the league’s revenue-sharing system, the Rays are revenue takers, not payors. The bottom line is, the Rays can wish to engage in a split-season with Montreal all they want. They can put up signs and talk about it with fans and local political representatives as a way to get a new ballpark in Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg. But, without approval from the MLB Players Association, the idea is nothing more than a concept. We’ll know whether it moves from proposal to reality if the MLBPA approves it… and not before.",

The good Blue chip NFT projects such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and CyberKongz have great teams and communities behind them.

CryptoPunks became so popular that individual images have been auctioned off at Christie's and Sotheby's. At first, everyone could get in. Let's take Axie Infinity as an example. It was extremely popular in Southeast Asia because the cost of entry was close to nothing and you could make some money on the side with it, which was crucial for some during the pandemic. The future of NFTs goes beyond crypto art. More on that in the video. The bad The best-in-class NFTs are too expensive for the regular joe to buy, creating opportunities for copycats to emerge. 99% of NFTs will go to zero because of this. Hype takes away common sense.

According to leaked emails obtained by The New York Times and Melbourne’s The Age newspaper, unvaccinated players will likely be granted a visa into Australia but must spend two weeks in isolation in a quarantine hotel. “We feel the need to reach out to you all to clear up false and misleading information that has recently been spread by other parties about the conditions that players will be forced to endure at next year’s Australian Open,” the email said. “We have been communicating regularly with ... the Tennis Australia team in recent months and they shared some good news with us on our Players’ Council call last Friday so that you know the facts.” Government officials last week declared international players would be required to be fully vaccinated in order to be granted entry into Australia for the first grand slam of the year (Jan. 17-30).

The email said Tennis Australia was still working with the government on the details but because Victoria state was expected to hit a vaccination target of 90% of the adult population by next month, \"it has been confirmed that conditions for the players at the Australian Open will improve significantly.” It said players were expected to be allowed to start arriving in Australia from Dec. 1. Tennis Australia was expected to comment later Monday. Victoria state Sports Minister Martin Pakula said the details weren't finalized, with the state and federal governments still in discussion. “It will be done in plenty of time for all of the players to know what the requirements are and for those who aren’t vaccinated to get vaccinated,\" Pakula told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Monday. “We are still resolved with Tennis Australia and the Commonwealth the question of whether unvaccinated foreign nationals will be allowed into Australia at all and, if so, under what circumstances.” Australia is preparing to re-open its international borders for the first time in more than 18 months, but it’ll be a gradual, state-by-state process starting next month and will depend on vaccination rates across the country. Fully vaccinated people will have fewer restrictions in Australia than those who are not. The vaccination debate has been ongoing in tennis since international competition started re-emerging following a global shutdown at the start of the pandemic last year. Some players, including nine-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, have advocated that the decision to get the vaccine should be a personal choice. Others, including Andy Murray, have said it should be mandated for the good of the majority. At the U.S. Open, which ended Sept. 12, spectators had to show proof of at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to attend matches, although players weren’t required to get a shot. Both the men’s and the women’s tours are recommending all players get vaccinated but so far have not enforced it. Ahead of the Australian Open earlier this year, all players had to quarantine for two weeks and be regularly tested under Australia’s strict regulations on COVID-19 measures. Most were allowed a limited time outside to practice, but any who tested positive or we deemed to be close contacts of a positive case — which in some cases meant simply being on the same charter flight — weren’t allowed to leave their hotel rooms.

Seth Wenig/AP hide caption Chris Smalls, who runs the self-organized worker group Amazon Labor Union, has been gathering signatures from Amazon warehouse workers on Staten Island in support of a union election. Amazon warehouse workers in New York plan to take their first formal step toward unionization on Monday. Organizers from Amazon's Staten Island facilities say they've collected some 2,000 signatures from warehouse workers who say they want a union election. On Monday afternoon, they plan to hand-deliver those signatures to a local labor office, which could authorize such a vote. This labor push stands out for being unaffiliated with any national union. It's a product of a self-organized, grassroots worker group called the Amazon Labor Union, financed via GoFundMe. It is run by Chris Smalls, who led a walkout at the start of the pandemic to protest working conditions and was fired the same day. The group is now pushing to unionize warehouses that employ an estimated 7,000 people, packing and shipping products for the massive New York market. \"We want better working conditions,\" Smalls told NPR on Thursday . \"We want higher wages, we want longer breaks, we want better medical leave options.\" The Staten Island campaign faces an uphill battle as Amazon has for decades successfully fought off labor organizing at its U.S. warehouses. The company is now the second-largest U.S. private employer after Walmart, with 950,000 full- and part-time employees as of last month. So far, the closest an Amazon warehouse has gotten to unionizing was this spring, when workers in Alabama voted on whether to join a retail union and overwhelmingly rejected unionizing . Later, a federal labor official found that Amazon's anti-union campaign tainted that election , and Alabama workers now await a ruling on whether they get a re-vote. Amazon in its latest statement argued that unions were not \"the best answer\" for workers: \"Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes — quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle.\" The Staten Island warehouse cluster has been among the most active Amazon facilities. Since the walkout and protest in March 2020 , workers have also filed ten labor complaints , alleging Amazon has interfered with their organizing efforts. The National Labor Relations Board says its lawyers have found some merit in three of them and continue to investigate others. New York's Attorney General is also pursuing a legal case over Smalls' firing . Smalls alleges Amazon fired him as retaliation for his activism. Amazon says he had violated quarantine and safety measures. A top corporate executive also had to apologize after Vice News reported on leaked notes from a meeting with founder Jeff Bezos, in which Smalls, who is Black, was described as \"not smart, or articulate,\" prompting accusations of racism . Since April, Smalls and the Amazon Labor Union have been collecting Staten Island worker signatures in favor of a union vote, holding barbecues, handing out water and coffee as people leave work and setting up fire pits with s'mores. Smalls says Amazon, for its part, has begun posting anti-union signs around the warehouses and even mounted a fence with barbed wire to push organizers further from the buildings. The company did not comment on those allegations. Labor rules require organizers to show support from at least 30% of the workers they seek to unionize. The National Labor Relations Board officials will scrutinize eligibility of the collected signatures, among other things. Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's recent financial supporters.",

Tesla: The electric vehicle pioneer Many consider Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) the driving force behind the rise of electric vehicle technology. Its success with the Model S in 2012 forced legacy automotive manufacturers to respect and eventually invest in developing EV offerings of their own. Competitors and investors alike doubted the company for years. CEO Elon Musk admitted that the massive investments needed to develop and then manufacture its Model 3 nearly put Tesla out of business. Now Tesla's profitable , generating $1.3 billion in free cash flow during its most recent quarter. It can help fund new factories in Berlin and Texas with roughly $16 billion in cash on its balance sheet. These factories will help build Tesla's Model Y and the upcoming Cybertruck model. Tesla products account for roughly 15% of the world's EV market, which could grow as new models (like the Cybertruck) are released and its self-driving technology continues to mature, though some of its competitors might say something about that. 2. General Motors: Evolving to address changing needs Legacy automakers like General Motors ( NYSE:GM ) must balance their already successful business selling gas engine vehicles while embracing new technologies , including the rise of electric models. General Motors has made strategic investments for walking that line, which could position it to continue thriving as the automotive industry evolves. The company has launched a \"transformation strategy\" that will focus long-term resources on developments in electric vehicle technology while retaining its profitable gas-powered models such as SUVs and pickup trucks in the short term. GM's target is to have 30 global electric vehicle models launched by 2025. Its GMC Hummer EV SUV and pickup models have seen strong preorder demand and will continue to roll out over several years. While Tesla is building new facilities on emerging financial stability, GM is converting its existing resources, including its \"Factory Zero,\" reconfigured to make its EVs. It hopes that electric vehicles will switch places with gas engine models as the driver of its business by the end of the decade. 3. Ford: Leveraging its popular brands to succeed Another major American car company, Ford ( NYSE:F ) , is trying to balance the present with the future. The heart of Ford is the company's trucks, as well as its commercial vehicle lines, which hold 43% market share in the U.S. Ford's F-series trucks have been the best-selling vehicle in the country for the past 44 years, and its Transit Van series is the best-selling cargo van in the world. It's leveraging its most popular brands to enter the EV space, launching its \"Mach-E\" based on the Mustang brand and the \"Lightning\" version of the F150, both fully electric models. The company is currently trying to increase production capacity for the F150 Lightning to 80,000 units by 2024, which falls well short of Tesla's 241,000 vehicles in the third quarter alone. However, legacy autos like Ford and GM still produce far more cars when you factor in gas engine models, routinely delivering more than a million vehicles per quarter. Both Ford and General Motors are putting the resources and money into what is likely to be a long-term transition to EVs. But because EV model sales are still just around 5% of global sales, a \"hybrid business model\" that changes to EVs over time could allow for EV adoption without damaging the financials of these legacy competitors. 4. Genuine Parts: For those who want to keep their non-EV cars running It's important to note that the transition to EVs will not be an overnight thing for consumers or investors. It will likely take years for EV sales to take the majority away from gas-powered vehicles, and the average car now lasts more than a decade on the road. Drivers will be repairing traditional vehicles as we know them for decades to come, which means business should remain strong for companies like Genuine Parts ( NYSE:GPC ) that cater to the used car market. The company is a leading distributor of vehicle replacement parts, primarily through its network of NAPA Auto Parts stores, which have roughly 9,500 locations worldwide. The business generated roughly $1.6 billion in free cash flow over the past year, pays a dividend that yields 2.4% and that has grown the past 65 years in a row, one of the longest streaks by any public company. Investors looking for a more stable, defensive investment in the automotive space should consider Genuine Parts, which is likely to continue keeping used cars on the road for years to come, despite the steady growth of EVs. Even then, EVs will likely need replacement parts as well.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Around 1980, according to the CDC , only 11% of Americans wore seatbelts. Today, thanks to considerable prodding and legislation, seatbelt usage is almost universal with 90% of Americans buckling up. In 1966, no states had mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. In what is a complicated legislative history , Congress has used carrots and sticks to prod states to adopt them. In 2020 , 19 states and DC had universal requirements, 28 had requirements for a subset of riders (usually age-based), and only three (Illinois, Iowa, and New Hampshire) had no such requirements. These motor safety laws presented Americans with a trade-off between personal liberty and the common good, a trade-off that is in the news again with the issue of COVID mandates. In a poll for USA Today , Ipsos probed Americans’ views about the trade-offs between the common good and personal liberty by asking questions in four areas. Around 85% of Americans supported speed limits on highways and interstates, requiring people to have auto insurance, motorcycle helmet requirements, and mandatory seat belt laws. In each of these cases, Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly approved of these regulations. In the poll’s questions on citizenship, roughly identical large majorities supported requiring young people to attend school and requiring a valid government-issued ID to vote. In only one area — requiring men to register for the draft — did support (at 46%) fall below a majority. Here Republicans were more in favor than Democrats. In another set of questions on the economy, roughly three-quarters of Americans supported zoning laws and minimum building codes for construction sites. Once again, the responses were virtually identical for Republicans and Democrats. On issues involving public health, Republicans and Democrats differed on two of today’s hot button issues, requiring vaccines in their workplaces and mask wearing in schools. Interestingly, the partisan gap on requiring children to be vaccinated against measles, diphtheria, tetanus, or chicken pox was only 11 points between Republicans (77%) and Democrats (88%). On most of the 20 issues the pollsters examined, the common good outweighed personal liberty for the American public. The strong support for many of these policies may have conditioned responses to the next question in the USA Today /Ipsos poll. When asked which was more important, 30% said “protecting personal liberty, even if it may result in other people getting hurt” while 70% said “protecting the common good, even if it means requiring some people to do things they don’t want to do.” Eighty-five percent of Democrats and 49% of Republicans chose protecting the common good. Given all these responses, it shouldn’t surprise readers that partisan divisions carry over to questions about COVID vaccines today. In the new issue of the AEI Polling Report , we explore many such questions. In Gallup’s September poll , 58% of those employed favored requiring all employees who don’t have a medical exemption to get the vaccine, up from 46% in May. In the September poll, only 36% opposed this requirement. Slightly more than a quarter of employed people (27%) said their workplace is now requiring a vaccine, according to a recent October Axios/Ipsos poll. Nationally, Americans seem to believe that this is something an employer can and should do.

While we recognize that smoking is harmful, we also think the decision to smoke should be one’s own. This belief seems to apply to vaccines, too. A solid majority (72%) in the USA Today /Ipsos poll says people have a right not to be vaccinated. But at the same time, 70% say the unvaccinated should not be expected to be around the vaccinated. Americans favor barring them from large events, from traveling on planes or trains, and from going to restaurants. Thirty-eight percent nationally say the unvaccinated should lose their jobs, including a near majority of Democrats (49%) compared to 24% of Republicans. Divisions and disruptions over mandates aren’t new as the seatbelt and motorcycle history shows us. In the present situation, for most Americans, the common good outweighs the libertarian impulse.",

    "full_description": "What happened Fuel cell stock Bloom Energy ( NYSE:BE ) is absolutely crushing the market today, skyrocketing 33.5% as of 9:35 a.m. EDT after the company struck a massive deal. So what Bloom Energy's three-year-old partnership with South Korean based SK Group's affiliate SK ecoplant took a big leap Monday morning when they announced a multi-billion dollar deal. Image source: Getty Images. SK ecoplant has contracted to buy at least 500 megawatts of fuel cells from Bloom Energy, estimated to be worth $4.5 billion in revenue, between 2022 and 2025. That aside, the two companies plan to set up two hydrogen innovation centers, one each in the U.S. and South Korea, and SK ecoplant will also invest $500 million in Bloom Energy through purchases of preferred stock, after which SK ecoplant will appoint a member to Bloom Energy's board of directors. This is, undeniably, a huge deal for Bloom Energy for two reasons: First, Bloom Energy generated only $794.2 million in revenue last year and last forecast it will generate revenue between $950 million and $1 billion in 2021. The company's deal with SK ecoplant now means much bigger revenue coming Bloom Energy's way. Second, Bloom Energy will not only expand its global footprint through this deal, but can also use the $500 million investment from SK ecoplant to rapidly commercialize its hydrogen solutions and even possibly strengthen its balance sheet, among other things. Bloom Energy ended its second quarter with total debt worth $519.2 million. BE data by YCharts Now what The biggest concern for shareholders in Bloom Energy so far has been the company's inability to turn a profit yet despite counting some of the largest global companies among its customers and growing its revenue steadily in recent years. Bloom Energy's on-site energy servers are designed to provide uninterrupted power supply from renewable energy by using solid-oxide fuel cells to convert natural gas and hydrogen into electricity, and are already used by global companies like Alphabet , FedEx , and Home Depot . With today's development, investors now expect Bloom Energy to finally turn profitable and cash-flow-positive. It's therefore not surprising to see the market bet big on the Bloom Energy shares today, especially given how they plunged after hitting all-time highs of $44.95 a share early February. With the company also expected to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 4, this one's a red-hot stock to watch right now .",

[+] during the Serie A 2021/22 football match between FC Internazionale and Juventus FC at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, Milan, Italy on October 24, 2021 (Photo by Fabrizio Carabelli/LiveMedia/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images It wasn’t a Derby d’Italia to stay long in the memory. Inter and Juventus played out a rather turgid 1-1 affair at San Siro, with neither side particularly satisfied with the outcome of the game. For the home side, they’ve dropped more points in their pursuit of Napoli and Milan at the top of the table and in their attempt to retain the title; for Juve, it kept them within touching distance for a top four place, now just a point behind Jose Mourinho’s Roma, but their performance for the majority of the game didn’t enthrall many, except perhaps for an insomniacs. Former Juve boss Fabio Capello was critical of Max Allegri’s approach. Speaking on Sky Sport Italia after the game, Capello remarked that Juve “didn’t play for 65 minutes.” Capello continued, “I am a fan of Allegri, but tonight he didn’t convince me.” Ironically, Juve’s performance was very reminiscent of the Capello era in the mid-2000s, when the former Milan and Roma coach had one of the strongest Juve sides in history. Capello’s Juve was two years of insipid football that is fondly remembered by no one.

The Juve squad he inherited is a bloated, unbalanced mess, and it will take Allegri time to find his best system with the right personnel. An awful start to the season has seen Allegri slowly manage to turn the ship around. Going into the Derby d’Italia, they had won four consecutive games 1-0, including the morale-boosting win against Chelsea in the Champions League. Allegri’s primary focus was to regain the defensive solidity that the club is famous for, which was a focal point of his first stint in charge, and was subsequently lost after his departure in 2019. This has come at the expense of entertainment or anything resembling enterprising football, not that Allegri will care. Juve conceded 11 goals in their opening six league games, since the win against Chelsea, Wojciech Szczesny has been beaten just twice. Juve are clearly still in transition, but heads were scratched by many in the wake of Allegri leaving Federico Chiesa and Paulo Dybala on the bench. Dybala’s case was more understandable, as he’d been out for close to a month with injury. Chiesa however has been Juve’s most dangerous player this season, and should’ve been included from the start. When the pair entered in the second half, Juve looked a different team, and finally caused Inter some difficulty. They are very much a work in progress, but the signs are promising that Allegri will mould them back into their old selves, but patience is needed. Inter, meanwhile, undoubtedly performed the better of the two. Simone Inzaghi has made the Nerazzurri more attacking than predecessor Antonio Conte, but, much like with Juve over the last two years, that has come at the cost of defensive rigour. Inter have conceded more than any side currently in the top five, and Samir Handanovic has only kept a single clean sheet in Serie A this season – on the opening day against Genoa. City neighbours Milan, by contrast, have conceded just three. Inzaghi’s biggest headache is the third midfielder in his 3-5-2 system. Marcelo Brozvic and Nicolo Barella are a given to start when fit, but none of Hakan Calhanoglu, Roberto Gagliardini or Arturo Vidal have impressed, whilst Stefano Sensi is perpetually injured. This has resulted in a lack of balance, to an extent. But given the anxiety by the club’s supporters in the wake of the departures of Conte, Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi, Inzaghi has done a tremendous job in alleviating the fear that Inter’s drop-off would be massive this season. However in Inter’s biggest games this season – Atalanta, Lazio and Juve – they’ve failed to win any of them, securing just two points. The upcoming games against Milan and Napoli should give us a better idea of where Inter are at in terms of a title tilt. Both Allegri and Inzaghi are still feeling the way around the squad, both sides are still works in progress, but you suspect both will get it right.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The writer Carl Sagan once wrote that “Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere.” If the pandemic has taught us anything, the role of imagination for businesses is an essential ingredient for growth and change. National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) offers American businesses a moment of reprieve where they can indulge in innovative ideas, creative musings, and building new strategic thinking for organizational growth. While NDEAM started as a vehicle to raise awareness of the employment needs of persons with disabilities, the concept has the potential to be so much more and serve an expanded role that can enhance its status throughout American business. For too long National Disability Employment Awareness month has dwelled within the confines of the modality of the Disability Rights Movement. While it continues to serve a powerful function in this context, it is critical that corporate leaders recognize the inherent value beyond the acknowledgment of hiring and retention practices for persons with disabilities, but rather see it as a benchmark of imagination that can provide new ways of thinking and practicing business for the 21st Century. By beginning to look at National Disability Employment Awareness Month through this lens it opens the possibility to rethink everything from employee engagement, management practice, customer acquisition, marketing strategy, and so much more. In a time when companies are trying to restructure as quickly as possible and find new growth opportunities and discover a competitive advantage, it is the role of the disability experience that can offer a new path towards salvation. So, if corporate leaders throughout American business are truly going to buy into this line of thinking, the questions are, where to begin? It begins with the idea that business leaders must rethink their relationship with disability overall. The fact that National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a critical reminder of a communities needs and values while serving as a blueprint to stimulate businesses and envision opportunities across the larger canvas of the corporate ecosystem. Just like within the disability community itself, there is inherent intersectionality across the human experience that binds us all and businesses are no different. These nuggets of information must be mined and harnessed in this evolving work culture. The disability experience has much to teach, and corporate leaders can no longer afford to look away and see National Disability Employment Month as just an afterthought, but rather a building block in redefining the future of work. The coronavirus pandemic with all its horrors has offered a silver lining, a path to reimagine disability in a larger context seeing its importance in the role of the changing culture of work whether it be the nuances of remote work to redefining relationships between employer and employee, identifying the idea that communal fellowship is as fundamental to business success as celebrating difference. American businesses must strike while the iron is hot and reassess their strategies as it pertains to the role that National Disability Employment Awareness Month can play in the next steps of their vision of the future. As we begin to describe this new wedding between disability and business it is important, we move beyond the nuptials and get to what the day-to-day marriage looks like. In Part Two of this column, the goal is to focus on exploring “next practices” to highlight how American corporate leaders can take this month that amplifies awareness and embraces the imaginative qualities to shape a fresh business model creating a distinct value as we move away from the pandemic to a new era of change.",

Dividend stocks, however, returned a positive 1.8%. Image source: Getty Images. The study also found that from 1970 on, dividends represented an astounding 84% of the index's total return . Reinvesting dividends in the benchmark, coupled with the power of compounding, would have turned a $10,000 investment into more than $3.8 million compared to the $627,161 that grubstake would have become based just on the index's price alone. Although you might be convinced that buying dividend-paying stocks is a proven, profitable strategy for generating superior long-term returns, the obvious next question is: Which dividend stocks do you buy? Simply chasing yield is a risky pursuit since a higher yield often carries higher risk, but whether you're a growth or value investor, there's an income stock that can fit into everyone's portfolio. The following pair of dividend stocks happen to not only be solid income stocks, but also benefit from being dirt cheap. Annaly Capital Management The largest mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) by market cap, Annaly Capital Management ( NYSE:NLY ) is also the premier mREIT, investing in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities typically backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government through agencies including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. They represent 99% of its mortgage portfolio, as of the end of June. The goal for Annaly and other mREITs is to maximize the difference between the average yield they receive from their mortgage securities and what they pay to borrow money. That means one of their biggest risks is easy-money Federal Reserve policy, which keeps interest rates artificially low and induces homeowners to refinance their higher-rate mortgages for lower-rate ones. That's why Annaly is experiencing an increase in its constant pre-payment rate (CPR), or the percentage of its portfolio that it expects to be paid off within a year. Its CPR jumped to 26.4% in the second quarter from 23.9% in the first quarter. While it expects its long-term CPR to be 12.9% -- better than the 18% it forecast a year ago -- that's still up from the 11.8% rate Annaly expected two months ago. Fortunately, with the economic outlook clouded, the Fed is not going to undertake any changes in policy that will dramatically upset the apple cart. Annaly's stock is down 10% from recent highs, but it trades at around 4 times trailing earnings and 8 times analysts' estimates. Its dividend currently yields 10% annually, right where it has averaged over the past two decades, a period where the mREIT has returned some $20 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend income. Image source: Getty Images. Viatris Formed last November via the $12 billion merger of the branded medicines business of Pfizer 's Upjohn unit and generic-drug maker Mylan, Viatris ( NASDAQ:VTRS ) is making a go of it by building on the best of both worlds. The market, though, is worried about its ability to make a profit while carrying significant amounts of debt. Since being spun off, Viatris has produced substantial losses, but the company anticipates that a quarter of its outstanding debt will be repaid by 2023. That's when it expects to achieve $1 billion in cost synergies, or double the amount it expects this year. On an adjusted basis, it has produced net earnings of $2.3 billion, or more than twice as much as it generated a year ago. After debt reduction, Viatris' management would like to reinvest some annual operating cash flow into new research and development. That should give it improved financial flexibility, which would enable the biotech to reward its shareholders further, either by repurchasing its own stock, lifting its dividend, or kick-starting its internal drug development program. Viatris is also perfectly positioned to take advantage of an aging U.S. and global population through its leading generic division as the industry grows almost 6% annually -- from $172 billion last year to $240 billion by 2026. It also just recently won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for Semglee, an insulin drug for treating diabetes and the first interchangeable biosimilar in the U.S. Viatris trades at less than 4 times earnings estimates, about 80% of its book value, and 10 times the free cash flow it produces. The dividend it initiated after its spinoff yields 3.2% annually, giving investors a chance to buy this dirt-cheap biotech before it unlocks the value inherent in its business.",

PayPal investors, on the other hand, are ecstatic. Shares of the fintech were up by 5%. Image source: Getty Images. So what And so, after five days of wondering, it comes down to this: Despite Monday morning's recovery, PayPal stock was still trading at a 7.1% discount to what it fetched before rumors began floating that a takeover was imminent. But Pinterest shares, too, were down -- a solid 10% from pre-rumor prices. And for traders who tried to \"buy the rumor, sell the news,\" well, it appears that strategy scored them a big, fat zero no matter which way they came at the deal. Now what That's the bad news -- but here's the good news for long-term investors: The upshot of this M&A hullabaloo is that two high-quality stocks now cost notably less than they cost a week ago. Pinterest shares are trading at less than 15 times sales, and Pinterest stock is going for less than 13 times sales. Both companies are solidly profitable, with Pinterest earning more than $161 million in net profit over the past year and PayPal earning $4.9 billion . Earnings quality is high at both companies as well, with PayPal's $4.8 billion in positive free cash flow backing up $0.98 of every dollar of reported income. Pinterest's free cash flow is actually more than twice its reported income. Long-term investors might want to look at Monday's sell-off as a buying opportunity . Based on the morning's price moves, it appears that this is exactly what PayPal buyers are doing.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Director Hwang Dong-hyuk on the set of 'Squid Game' with actors Park Hae-soo and Lee Jung-jae. Netflix After seeing Netflix’s NFLX Korean mega-hit Squid Game explode in popularity globally, investors are confident that the streaming platform will focus on developing more international content to boost subscriber growth. Squid Game amassed 111 million fans in just under a month from its release and is currently worth around $900 million to Netflix , while costing just $21.4 million to make. These numbers and the return on investment will be seen as affirming to Netflix and a tantalizing prospect which its competitors will hope to emulate. Important questions are now emerging: How does developing local content boost subscriber growth for a global streamer? Does such a strategy always pay off? What are some challenges that Netflix faces in the creation and exhibition of local content in overseas markets? Perhaps more critically, ethical questions also need to be asked as streamers carry a disproportionate amount of power when they establish themselves in new territories. They can profoundly disrupt local entertainment ecosystems and industry hierarchies—and also inadvertently decide what gets seen and labeled as the country’s cultural product (eg. a “Korean film”) when it gets packaged for a global audience. Within its native industries, it can also cause a significant shift in tastes and the kind of art that local creatives aspire towards or view as “success.” ‘Squid Game’: Not an overnight sensation While many have referred to Squid Game as an overnight sensation and marveled at the show’s rapid ascent into global recognition, the drama is the product of years of careful investment in the Korean industry’s talent, stories and infrastructure. When other competitors were earlier hesitant to make similar moves, Netflix saw the opportunities presented by the Korean cultural wave and ventured into the Korean domestic market in 2016. At the beginning, Netflix met immense resistance as major domestic players like CJ ENM and SK Telecom turned down partnership requests , hoping to prevent Netflix from getting a foothold locally by denying it access to local content that South Koreans might want to stream. Actresses Jung Ho-yeon and Lee Yoo-mi on the set of 'Squid Game.' Netflix However, Netflix stood by its investment and steadily won Korean and global audiences over with its solid, well-received repertoire of works like the slice-of-life medical drama Hospital Playlist as well as zombie thriller Kingdom , set in the Joseon period. Other popular originals include Sweet Home and Prison Playbook . The streamer has since set up two studios and produced around 80 films and series. In February 2021, Netflix announced that it was further investing $500 million in Korean content . MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge Why commission international originals? Netflix is seeing slowing growth in its American home market, as it moves towards a saturation point and faces heavy competition from the likes of Hulu, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. Netflix only added 70,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter, a signal that it is approaching a streaming ceiling, at least for now. Research firm Digital TV Research recently forecasted Disney+ subscriber numbers to surpass Netflix’s by 2025. Additionally, Reuters reported Netflix losing “a lot of market share since the onset of the pandemic” as other platforms like Apple TV+ and Disney+ are quickly gaining popularity from stay-at-home entertainment seekers. However, the situation for Netflix looks more promising overseas. In its letter to shareholders for the third quarter, the streamer announced that it added 4.38 million subscribers from July through September, with half of them (2.2 million) coming from the Asia-Pacific market, a region that Netflix acknowledged was its “largest contributor to membership growth.” In Europe, Netflix saw a net addition of 1.8 million subscribers, a sharp improvement from the 188k new subscribers it added in the second quarter, pointing towards a “particularly strong impact” from several titles. Moving overseas and investing in local content can lure new subscribers in less penetrated markets. Seeing their own native stories, voices and cultures onscreen may generate more support and willingness to pay for a Netflix subscription among non-American audiences, versus merely being fed a continual stream of largely “Western” content. The key is to create authentic local shows that will create the necessary buy-in from the domestic audience, but also balance that with a global appeal that leverages the streaming platform’s international subscriber base. Squid Game demonstrated this best by marrying Korean childhood games and social critiques with more global sensibilities related to genre and anxieties over capitalism. Further afield, Netflix tapped onto Japan’s entertainment prowess and global standing, particularly in the anime space. Partnering with anime studios and creators, it plans to offer more than 25 original works from Japan this year. Drawing on a subscriber base that rapidly expanded during the pandemic, in February 2021, Netflix raised the prices of its streaming plans in Japan. The cost of the standard plan rose to 1,490 yen (US$14) per month, 170 yen or roughly $2 more than the previous cost. While Netflix has not moved to try and capture China’s massive audience, it has made inroads in critical Asian markets like India, South Korea and Japan. For example, India’s first Netflix original was the Hindi-language crime thriller Sacred Games starring the high-profile Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan. Japan boasts popular originals like Alice in Borderland , Erased and The Naked Director . Dystopian thriller 'Alice in Borderland,' a Netflix original from Japan. Robot/Netflix Another (less-talked-about) reason driving the local commissioning strategy for streamers is the relatively lower cost of making shows in these markets. CNBC reported that the cost of Squid Game , if made in the U.S with its cast and union production regulations, would have been five-to-10 times more . Streamers can also tap on local tax rebates and co-production funds to reduce production costs. These are often offered by film commissions and governments to attract productions to their countries, boost tourism as well as offer knowledge and skill exchange with their local entertainment industry talent. In South Korea’s case, Netflix added 5.6 trillion won (US$4.7 billion) to the economy between 2016 and 2020, with 2.3 trillion won in just last year alone. It also created around 16,000 full-time jobs over the period, across the entertainment sector and associated industries like publishing, music and tourism. No easy entrance into local markets However, streamers also face many difficulties in entering overseas markets. In Asia, there is often resistance from the big domestic players, understandably worried that global streamers will steal away their own audiences. Also, streamers have to navigate a complex, uneven web of government regulations across the region, especially since they carry content for mature audiences on their OTT services. Similar to what it encountered when launching in South Korea in 2016, Netflix was quickly blocked in Indonesia by state-owned telecommunications company Telkom Group, which banned access to Netflix on all of its platforms. Citing a permit issue and unfiltered content displaying violence and adult situations, Telkom Group insisted that Netflix’s content had to be censored according to Indonesia’s regulations. Indonesia’s market still proves to be a particularly difficult one for Netflix. Disney+ Hotstar has already taken a big lead since its September 2020 launch, with 2.5 million subscribers over Netflix’s 850,000 (data from January 2021). Local cultural bodies are also apprehensive over a global player coming in. After all, streaming platforms have an immense power over what sort of local stories get told and pushed to overseas audiences. In Indonesia’s case, the government was also wary that Netflix’s presence in the country would negatively impact its own entertainment ecosystem and industry. The Jakarta Post reported the Indonesia ICT Institute’s executive director Heru Sutadi saying, “Foreign platforms coming to Indonesia often think that they don’t need Indonesian companies, so there is a sense of defeat. Netflix was pressured so that we could have a better standing in the negotiation.” In January 2020, Indonesia’s communications and information minister urged the streamer to prioritize making original content with its local talent and increase the number of Indonesian shows on its platform. As the oft-quoted saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.” Wielding global brands and extensive cultural soft power, streaming platforms need to consider new questions and dynamics when commissioning local content, beyond ones purely driven by dollars and data: What kinds of local stories are they choosing and curating? Whose voices are being elevated and amplified—or silenced? Who gets to speak—and on behalf of whom? As the ambitions of streaming platforms continue to grow, their new challenge will be calibrating the balance between ensuring that local ecosystems (creatives, talent, audiences, government bodies) feel heard and properly represented onscreen and offscreen—while maintaining their global appeal.",

    "content": "The 78th United States secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that U.S. lawmakers are considering taxing unrealized capital gains. According to Yellen, the funds collected would help finance things related to climate and social change. While Yellen said that U.S. senator Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) was working on drafting the plan, a great number of Americans have been criticizing the proposal on forums and social media. Janet Yellen Discusses Unrealized Capital Gains Tax Proposal, House Speaker Pelosi Approves The phrase “unrealized capital gains” has been trending on social media and forums during the last 24 hours after the U.S. secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen discussed the subject on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Yellen explained the concept, which aims to tax Americans on unrealized capital gains stemming from liquid assets. Of course, like the controversial $600 IRS monitoring proposal, Yellen stressed that the proposal was aimed at “extremely wealthy individuals, billionaires.” Yellen emphasized, however, that the tax was not a wealth tax. “I wouldn’t call that a wealth tax, but it would help get at capital gains, which are an extraordinarily large part of the incomes of the wealthiest individuals and right now escape taxation until they’re realized,” Yellen said on CNN. She explained that the Democrat senator Ron Wyden was working on the proposal, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is backing the concept. Although, despite Yellen saying it wasn’t a “wealth tax,” Pelosi’s (D., Calif.) words were different when she told CNN on Sunday: “We probably will have a wealth tax.” .@SecYellen on the proposed tax which would pay for the Build Back Better act: \"It's not a wealth tax, but a tax on unrealized capital gains of exceptionally wealthy individuals.\" pic.twitter.com/7JXAysPkxI — The Hill (@thehill) October 24, 2021 Pelosi thinks the unrealized gains tax will help fund the $2 trillion spending bill and said the spending bill package was “pretty much there” and lawmakers are finalizing some of the “last decisions.” While Yellen, Democrats, and CNN have been lauding the idea of taxing unrealized gains, Americans are upset about the idea and consider it “unconscionable.” Political Commentators, Libertarians, Crypto Enthusiasts Scorn Yellen’s Proposal — ‘Tax on Unrealized Gains Is Legal Plunder’ The 2020 Libertarian vice presidential candidate, Spike Cohen, said “This is unconscionable. For those who don’t know, an ‘unrealized gain’ is when something you own gains value, but you don’t sell it. You know, like your house. Or your retirement fund. So now you have to sell it, to pay the taxes. If implemented, this would be an act of war against the remaining middle-class folks who still actually own things,” Cohen added. Cryptocurrency supporter and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz shared his two cents about unrealized gains on Twitter. “Maybe try eliminating [the] step-up basis first. And carried interest,” the billionaire investor said. “That would be a start. Unrealized gains on illiquid securities would be [an] unmitigated disaster.” Independent journalist Jordan Schachtel explained that “taxing unrealized gains is only minimally about taxation itself. That’s not the bigger objective,” Schachtel remarked. The journalist added: Taxing unrealized gains grants the government the ability to monitor your each and every move. Nearly every post on social media and forums concerning this subject is littered with commentary that indicates Americans think taxing unrealized gains is a horrible idea. Except for mainstream media publications like the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The Hill, and other publications that continue to argue that the tax is aimed at the “billionaire-class” and “exceptionally wealthy individuals.” American journalist and Youtuber Tim Pool said that the proposal is merely a trick on people with no money. “Wealth Tax, Unrealized gains, whatever,” Pool tweeted. “It’s a trick rich people are pulling on poor people who don’t understand how finance and the economy works. Wealth taxes will not do anything, people really don’t understand the power of that vast wealth.” Bitcoin proponent Stephen Livera stressed on social media that “Tax on unrealized gains is legal plunder. They created this mess and now they’re looking to pass the cost to the people.” Forcing people to sell their assets is totalitarian. It’s antithetical to a free market and will cause second and third order effects that will be devastating to an economy. This is actually what taxing unrealized gains will do. #bitcoin — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) October 25, 2021 The evolutionary behavioral scientist and well-known author Gad Saad noted sarcastically that the unrealized gains tax was a good concept. “This sounds like a good idea,” Saad said scornfully. “Also, we should engage in punitive action on unrealized crimes. You find the person who looks guilty and you preemptively give them the chair (for community cohesion and diversity),” the author concluded. What do you think about Janet Yellen and Nancy Pelosi telling Americans that lawmakers are planning to push through an unrealized gains tax in the upcoming $2 trillion spending bill? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.",

Janet Yellen Discusses Unrealized Capital Gains Tax Proposal, House Speaker Pelosi Approves The phrase “unrealized capital gains” has been trending on social media and forums during the last 24 hours after the U.S. secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen discussed the subject on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Yellen explained the concept, which aims to tax Americans on unrealized capital gains stemming from liquid assets. Of course, like the controversial $600 IRS monitoring proposal, Yellen stressed that the proposal was aimed at “extremely wealthy individuals, billionaires.” Yellen emphasized, however, that the tax was not a wealth tax. “I wouldn’t call that a wealth tax, but it would help get at capital gains, which are an extraordinarily large part of the incomes of the wealthiest individuals and right now escape taxation until they’re realized,” Yellen said on CNN. She explained that the Democrat senator Ron Wyden was working on the proposal, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is backing the concept. Although, despite Yellen saying it wasn’t a “wealth tax,” Pelosi’s (D., Calif.) words were different when she told CNN on Sunday: “We probably will have a wealth tax.” . @SecYellen on the proposed tax which would pay for the Build Back Better act: \"It's not a wealth tax, but a tax on unrealized capital gains of exceptionally wealthy individuals.\" pic.twitter.com/7JXAysPkxI — The Hill (@thehill) October 24, 2021 Pelosi thinks the unrealized gains tax will help fund the $2 trillion spending bill and said the spending bill package was “pretty much there” and lawmakers are finalizing some of the “last decisions.” While Yellen, Democrats, and CNN have been lauding the idea of taxing unrealized gains, Americans are upset about the idea and consider it “unconscionable.” Political Commentators, Libertarians, Crypto Enthusiasts Scorn Yellen’s Proposal — ‘Tax on Unrealized Gains Is Legal Plunder’ The 2020 Libertarian vice presidential candidate, Spike Cohen, said “This is unconscionable. For those who don’t know, an ‘unrealized gain’ is when something you own gains value, but you don’t sell it. You know, like your house. Or your retirement fund. So now you have to sell it, to pay the taxes. If implemented, this would be an act of war against the remaining middle-class folks who still actually own things,” Cohen added. Cryptocurrency supporter and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz shared his two cents about unrealized gains on Twitter. “Maybe try eliminating [the] step-up basis first. And carried interest,” the billionaire investor said. “That would be a start. Unrealized gains on illiquid securities would be [an] unmitigated disaster.” Independent journalist Jordan Schachtel explained that “taxing unrealized gains is only minimally about taxation itself. That’s not the bigger objective,” Schachtel remarked. The journalist added: Taxing unrealized gains grants the government the ability to monitor your each and every move. Nearly every post on social media and forums concerning this subject is littered with commentary that indicates Americans think taxing unrealized gains is a horrible idea. Except for mainstream media publications like the Wall Street Journal , Washington Post, The Hill, and other publications that continue to argue that the tax is aimed at the “billionaire-class” and “exceptionally wealthy individuals.” American journalist and Youtuber Tim Pool said that the proposal is merely a trick on people with no money. “Wealth Tax, Unrealized gains, whatever,” Pool tweeted . “It’s a trick rich people are pulling on poor people who don’t understand how finance and the economy works. Wealth taxes will not do anything, people really don’t understand the power of that vast wealth.” Bitcoin proponent Stephen Livera stressed on social media that “Tax on unrealized gains is legal plunder. They created this mess and now they’re looking to pass the cost to the people.” Forcing people to sell their assets is totalitarian. It’s antithetical to a free market and will cause second and third order effects that will be devastating to an economy. This is actually what taxing unrealized gains will do. #bitcoin — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) October 25, 2021 The evolutionary behavioral scientist and well-known author Gad Saad noted sarcastically that the unrealized gains tax was a good concept. “This sounds like a good idea,” Saad said scornfully. “Also, we should engage in punitive action on unrealized crimes. You find the person who looks guilty and you preemptively give them the chair (for community cohesion and diversity),” the author concluded. What do you think about Janet Yellen and Nancy Pelosi telling Americans that lawmakers are planning to push through an unrealized gains tax in the upcoming $2 trillion spending bill?

    "full_description": "In today's low-interest-rate environment, where 30-year mortgages can be found for around 3.2%, it gets much harder to justify paying off a mortgage early. After all, you're borrowing money at less than recent inflation, which makes it cheaper than free when measured versus the deteriorating purchasing power of your money. In addition, with the stock market's historical long-term returns somewhere around 10% annualized , you have a decent chance of beating your borrowing costs by investing. That combination makes it very tough to financially justify paying off your mortgage early. Still, there are a handful of reasons it might still make sense to retire that bill ahead of schedule anyway. Read on for five situations when you should pay off your mortgage early. Image source: Getty Images No. 1: If you're trying to qualify for college financial aid Colleges generally use one of two different sets of formulas for determining how much aid students qualify for. If they base their decisions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) process, equity in your primary home is not considered as an available asset to pay for college. Colleges that use the CSS profile, on the other hand, may consider home equity as an available asset to pay the bill, but not all do. If you assume you have a $400,000 house with a $250,000 mortgage balance and $250,000 worth of after-tax investments, schools that use FAFSA see those $250,000 of investments as available. If, on the other hand, you take those investments and pay off your mortgage, your net worth doesn't change, but schools that use FAFSA no longer see that pot of investment money as available to pay for school. Especially if you have more than one child for whom college is approaching soon, the benefit of lower out of pocket college costs might very well outweigh the returns from keeping that money invested. No. 2: If you're trying to qualify for an income-based subsidy If you have control over your income (such as if you run your own small business or are retired early and living off your investments), you might find it beneficial to keep your reported income low. For instance, if you get your health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, your out of pocket insurance premiums are based on your income level. The lower your income, the lower your insurance costs will be. By paying off your mortgage, your cash flow needs can be reduced substantially. If that enables you to keep your income down, the savings on your health insurance premiums over time could potentially outweigh the net returns you would get by investing while keeping a mortgage. No. 3: If you're retired and have five years or less to go on your mortgage A good financial guideline to follow is that money you expect to spend within the next five years does not belong in stocks . If you'll be living off your savings, your mortgage will be one of those bills you will have to cover. If you have five years or less left on your mortgage when you retire, that means you should have enough outside of your stock holdings to pay off your mortgage plus cover your other costs for five years. Chances are good that your cash, CDs, and/or short-term bonds will not outperform your mortgage by enough to justify keeping your mortgage while holding on to that extra money. As a result, in that situation, paying off your mortgage sooner can still leave you financially better off versus holding on to it, even in today's low interest rate environment. No. 4: If you want to make aggressive Roth IRA rollovers Rolling money into your Roth IRA from traditional retirement accounts can reduce your exposure to higher taxes and Medicare costs later in your retirement . The downside of rolling money into your Roth IRA is that you pay taxes in the year you make the conversion, generally at ordinary income tax rates. That makes such rollovers a complicated \"pay me now, or pay me more later\" type decision with a lot of moving parts. As a general rule, Roth IRA rollovers make the most sense if you can use up low income tax brackets and if you can make the tax payments from your non-retirement assets. The lower your ongoing costs of living, the more of your available income and cash flow can be used to pay the conversion taxes. As a result, it could very well make sense to pay off your mortgage early to free up that much more money to cover those conversion taxes and boost your Roth IRA balance sooner. No. 5: When you have 'enough', and peace of mind is important If you're on track or ahead of plan for your other life goals, there is really no need to keep to an overly aggressive financial plan. Even if you could potentially earn more money by keeping your mortgage and investing the money that could otherwise pay it off, there is no law that says you have to. Once your other goals are covered, it's OK to stop playing the game of aggressive investing and use some of your hard-earned money to pay off your mortgage. The peace of mind and improved monthly cash flows are legitimate benefits you will get from no longer having to make that substantial payment every month. When the market does crash again , you'll certainly be able to rest that much easier in your completely paid off home. When your mortgage is a tool rather than an obligation, you're in a good spot Regardless of where you end up on the decision to pay off your mortgage early or not, simply being able to do so puts you in a pretty good spot, financially speaking. So recognize that if you're in a position where that is a possibility, what you're really doing is optimizing between reasonable options, rather than choosing between a great and an awful idea. Keep your total financial picture and asset allocation strategy in mind, and you can make a reasonable decision on how to proceed for yourself. No matter when you get around to paying it off, you're certainly entitled to do a happy dance once your mortgage is gone. And if you can pay it off early in support of one of these five goals, then your happy dance can be all that much brighter.",

Every report has the potential to move the market. You're going to want to pay attention to all of them. Image source: Getty Images. Four out of five better not be bad With a whopping 80% of the FAANG stocks reporting this week, there's not going to be a dull moment. It all starts on Monday afternoon, when Facebook releases third-quarter results shortly after the market close. There will be more at stake when Facebook reports than just its financial performance and near-term outlook. Facebook is under fire right now. A former product manager-turned-whistleblower made some pretty heavy allegations against the social media juggernaut. From airing her grievances on 60 Minutes to testifying before Congress, Frances Haugen is making it that much harder for Facebook to regain the market's respect. The company may be a cash flow beast at an attractive valuation now, but will it stay on top after so many social miscues itself? Alphabet follows on Tuesday. It could have the headiest top-line growth of all five of the FAANG stocks reporting this season. Analysts see revenue soaring 37% from a year earlier, with earnings per share climbing even faster at a 43% clip. Alphabet has also faced some reputational challenges of its own this year. There are concerns with ad-tracking technology and the phasing out of cookies. It pales in comparison to what Facebook is up against, but it's something to watch out for in the earnings call. Wednesday is Apple's time to shine. It's also expected to grow year-over-year sales north of 30%, with profitability increasing even more. Some potential pressure points to watch for here include supply chain concerns that could eat into iPhone 13 inventory levels and recent App Store changes that could impact profitability. We'll close things out on Thursday with Amazon's report. Yes, each of the first four trading days this week will feature a single FAANG member offering up fresh financials. After four straight quarters of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth, the market's anticipating a sharp deceleration on Thursday. Net income is expected to decline. The bar is set low, but if reality matches the forecasts, investors may be concerned about Amazon's growth prospects. We have four big earnings reports coming in these next four days. All of them have the potential to move the market, and most of them probably will.",

That quarter's EPS of $1.46 included a $0.06 per-share boost from weather that was warmer and drier than the year-ago period and a $0.03 per-share benefit from \"impacts on the homeowner services group resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the company said. For context, in the second quarter , the company's revenue rose 7.3% year over year to $999 million, and EPS jumped 18% to $1.14. In Q2, the \"company's EPS got a $0.03 benefit from warmer and drier-than-average weather in its service territory, particularly the Northeast,\" as I wrote at the time. While American Water has regulated utility operations in 16 U.S. states, New Jersey and neighboring Pennsylvania are its largest regulated states by revenue, so their weather has an outsize effect on the company's overall weather-impact figure. In the first quarter, American Water's revenue rose 5.2% year over year to $888 million, and EPS increased 7.4% to $0.73. Regulated business efficiency Investors should continue to monitor American Water's adjusted operation and maintenance (O&M) efficiency ratio. This ratio, which is for the trailing year, reflects how well the company is controlling costs in its regulated business. The lower the number, the better. In the second quarter, this ratio was 33.9%, an improvement from 34.3% in the year-ago period. Data by YCharts. Guidance For full-year 2021, management expects EPS between $4.18 and $4.28, representing annual growth of 6.9% to 9.5% year over year. Management also continues to project long-term EPS growth averaging between 7% and 10% annually, anchored off weather-normalized 2020 EPS. Moreover, the company aims for average annual dividend increases at the high end of its EPS growth range. A solid long-term investment American Water stock should make for a solid long-term holding. While the stock's dividend yield is modest -- it's currently about 1.4% -- investors should be able to count on the company increasing its dividend every year, just as it's done since going public in 2008. American Water provides an essential product that has no substitutes, its industry-leading size gives it an advantage in the acquisition arena, and its results should get a long-term tailwind from climate change. Indeed, it's one of the three best climate change stocks to consider buying now , in my view.",

Kroger also has bags of Starburst or Twizzlers for $2.49 (most small bags are close to $4 these days).Kroger also has large boxes of Good & Plenty and other candy for just $1 each, good for the neighborhood kids you really like.The Cincinnati area also features a good deal at CVS stores, with a buy-one-get-one-free deal on many $5 candy bags.Finally, Meijer is competitive, too, with $3.99 bags on sale this week for $3.79. They are also selling giant bags of mixed candy, with 200 pieces total, for $20.But we know what grocery shelves have looked like all year, so don't wait till Sunday to shop, so you don't waste your money._____________________Don't Waste Your Money\" is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc.

    "full_description": "One of the primary metrics that many investors consider when evaluating a company and its stock is its cash position. How much cash does it have on hand, and how much free cash flow does it generate? Generally speaking, the more cash a company has coming in, the more it will have available to pay down debt, invest in its growth, and maintain and increase its dividend payouts. Consider, for example, Visa ( NYSE:V ) Visa has been one of the best and most consistent growth stocks on the market with an average annual return of about 26% over the past 10 years. It's also a growth stock that happens to pay out a dividend. While its dividend has a lower-than-average yield, Visa has raised its annual payout for 12 straight years and has plenty of cash to comfortably continue making raises. Let's take a closer look at how Visa's cash position help make it a great growth stock that has been able to increase its dividend payouts. Image source: Getty Images. Visa has lots of cash Visa is the largest credit card and payment processor in the world, and one of just two major players in its space along with Mastercard . While other companies like American Express and Discover also process credit card transactions, they follow a different business model in that they also lend the money to creditors. Visa and Mastercard don't, so they take on little to no credit risk -- they just collect fees for processing payments on their vast networks. Every time someone makes a purchase with a Visa-branded credit card, Visa extracts a fee, which becomes revenue. The business model also creates a situation of relatively low overhead and expenses, which leads to huge margins and lots of cash flow. Its operating margin -- the share of its revenue left over after it covers all the expenses associated with facilitating sales transactions -- is 65%. An operating margin of 15% to 20% is considered really good in a lot of business sectors, so 65% is off the charts. Visa's operating margin is also the highest among its payment processing peers. Visa currently has $18 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the books, with about $13.3 billion in operating cash flow and $12.6 billion in free cash flow annually. (Operating cash flow is the amount of money that flows into the business as a result of normal operating activities, while free cash flow is the excess cash it has left after it covers its operational expenses.) All of these metrics have steadily gone up over the past 10 years. V data by YCharts Now let's look at the other side of the balance sheet -- debt. Visa has manageable debt Cash is the lifeblood of any company. It lets you invest, weather downturns, and pay down debt, among other things. Visa, as of June 30, had about $21 billion in long-term debt. Is that manageable, given its capital strength? There are a couple of ways to measure that. One is the current ratio, a metric meant to gauge how well a company can manage its short-term liabilities. A current ratio under 1 means a company's liabilities are greater than its assets, so that's not good. Visa has a current ratio of 2, which means it can pay short-term liabilities two times over. That's a good number. Indeed, a number much higher than 2 on this metric may reflect that the company in question is hoarding cash too much rather than investing in growth. Another metric to watch is the debt-to-equity ratio -- total liabilities divided by shareholder equity. It can tell you how much a company is financing its operations through debt. A high debt-to-equity ratio -- say, anything over 2 -- suggests a company may be making too much use of debt to finance its growth efforts. A ratio under 1 -- which reflects a company using less debt and more of its own funds to finance operations -- is ideal. Visa's debt-to-equity ratio is an excellent 0.5. In sum, Visa has a lot of cash and a manageable level of debt. That combination has been one big reason it has been able to post an average annual return of about 26% over the past 10 years. But it's also a good bet for income investors. As mentioned, Visa has increased its dividend for the last 12 years and its quarterly dividend has grown by more than 1,100% since 2009. It offers a quarterly payout of $0.32 per share ($1.28 per share annually), which at current share prices yields 0.55%. Its yield is so low mostly because Visa's share prices have risen by about 975% over the past decade. Visa's payout ratio is about 22%. As dividend stocks go that is a very manageable ratio. Income investors will appreciate that Visa is not stretching to pay its dividend, and it has plenty of capacity to keep boosting it for years to come. This all adds up to a great investment, whether you're looking for dividend income, capital appreciation, or maybe a stock that offers both.",

As the world's biggest premium subscription video on demand service, it has a lot of room to grow that content budget well over $50 billion. Image source: Netflix. Entertaining the world There's still a tremendous opportunity to shift more entertainment time from linear television to streaming. Netflix expects to play a bigger and bigger role in people's entertainment choices for years to come. Management points out in its letter to shareholders that streaming currently accounts for just 28% of TV time in the United States, while cable and broadcast television accounts for 64%. Netflix represents just 6% of the total viewing time. And the U.S. is its most mature market. Netflix is increasingly a global company producing content all over the world. The Korean drama Squid Game is its biggest series ever. It plans to expand its local productions from 45 countries to more than 50 countries next year. The total addressable market, according to management, is the 1 billion broadband households around the world. With 213 million total subscribers, it still has a long way to go. \"Now, it will take a couple of decades to get there. It's not overnight,\" Hastings explained. But Netflix has always thought extremely long term. Growing verticals and geographies Netflix sees opportunities to grow its content spending across several different content categories and geographies. The company only went fully global in 2016, and its efforts with local language content are really only a few years old. What's more, it's found incredible success creating series and films in a country for the local audience, and taking those successes worldwide. As more of Netflix's growth comes from abroad, its local language content budget should expand along with it. But it can still monetize that content globally, including the valuable United States. Furthermore, Netflix is exploring increased investments in animation. Kids animation, specifically. And it bought the Roald Dahl Story Company to produce films, series, and games based on the British author's characters. Management says it can continue growing the budget in every category it works in for the foreseeable future. Tripling the content budget Netflix is now self-funding its growing content budget, eschewing the debt market. It expects break-even free cash flow for the full year 2021, and to produce positive cash flow in 2022 and beyond. \" ... we got to be able to have the revenue growth and margins,\" Hastings said, moderating his tone about the potential size of the content budget. But Netflix has been consistently growing both revenue and margin for years. Management still expects to grow its top line 18.8% this year, despite the strong growth in 2020, and its full-year operating margin will expand 2 percentage points to 20%. Growth going forward will need to come from a combination of subscriber growth and price increases. With a growing number of streaming services entering the global market, price increases may prove more difficult than in the past. That said, recent price increases haven't resulted in any increase in subscriber churn , while the rest of the industry fights to keep customers. Netflix appears to have more pricing power than its peers. If Netflix can maintain its double-digit revenue growth and continue its margin expansion over the next decade, it could easily triple the content budget in the long run, all while growing free cash flow and profits for investors.",

    "content": "Amazon said the legislation, adopted by parliament but not yet enacted, would punish those in rural areas who cannot easily visit a bookstore and rely on delivery. — Reuters pic Follow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates. PARIS, Oct 25 —Sophie Fornairon’s independent bookshop has survived the rise of Amazon thanks to a French law that prohibits price discounting on new books, but she says the e-commerce giant’s ability to undercut on shipping still skews the market against stores like hers.Fornairon, who owns the Canal Bookstore in central Paris, now hopes that new legislation that would set a minimum price for book deliveries will even the contest further in the battle of neighbourhood stores against Amazon.“It’s a just return towards a level playing field,” Fornairon, who employs four workers, said. “We’re not at risk of closing down any time soon, but Amazon is a constant battle”.Amazon said the legislation, adopted by parliament but not yet enacted, would punish those in rural areas who cannot easily visit a bookstore and rely on delivery.“Imposing a minimum shipping cost for books would weigh on the purchasing power of consumers,” Amazon told Reuters in a statement.That is an undesirable consequence government officials are wary of at a time President Emmanuel Macron administration is scrambling to head off growing discontent over rising energy prices six months from an election.In the country of Victor Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir, where local bookshops are held with special affection—they were deemed ‘essential businesses’ during latter COVID lockdowns—the move is the latest by the state to shield national culture against big tech firms.More than 20% of the 435 million books sold in France in 2019 were bought online and the market share of France’s 3,300 independent bookstores has been slowly declining because of competition from online retailers like Amazon, Fnac and Leclerc.Support from Macron helped push the legislation, which does not target Amazon by name, over the line. The minimum fee still has to be negotiated with the regulator.‘Distorted competition’French law prohibits free book deliveries but Amazon has circumvented this by charging a single centime (cent). Local book stores typically charge about €5-7 (RM24-34) for shipping a book.Amazon’s pricing strategy had resulted in the growing market share of a single operator, the Ministry of Culture said.“This law is necessary to regulate the distorted competition within online book sales and prevent the inevitable monopoly that will emerge if the status quo persists,” the ministry told Reuters.Centre-right Senator Laure Darcos, who drafted the law, decided upon the minimum delivery charge when she observed how bookstores maintained 70 per cent of their business despite being forced to shut during early Covid lockdowns, because the government reimbursed the shipping fees.“It showed what a brake on business the postage costs are for local bookstores,” Darcos said.Amazon had lobbied hard against the legislation, worried the French move might set a precedent, the senator said.France’s bookstores are concentrated in towns and cities. Amazon said online sales of books had enabled consumers to have equal access, regardless of where they lived.Virtually-free delivery allowed book lovers in rural areas to buy books at the same price as someone who could walk into a bookstore—precisely the spirit of the 1981 law, it said.Asked when the legislation would be enacted, the Ministry of Culture declined to give a date, saying it was too early to say.For Fornairon, the bookshop owner, the steady stream of US tourists through her door were a constant reminder of the shield French legislation had already wrapped around stores likes hers.“They say to me ‘we didn’t even know independent bookstores still existed’,” she said. — Reuters",

NEW YORK, Oct 25 — US stock indexes were set to open higher today as investors geared up for earnings reports from heavyweight technology companies this week, while PayPal jumped after saying it was not interested in buying Pinterest.PayPal Inc rose 4.6 per cent after the payments company scrapped its plans to buy the digital pinboard site Pinterest Inc for as much as $45 billion. Shares of Pinterest plunged 14.8 per cent.Tesla Inc, up 3.8 per cent in premarket trading, was set for record open after car rental firm Hertz placed an order for 100,000 Tesla cars, while Morgan Stanley boosted its price target on the electric-car maker’s stock.Facebook Inc will kick off quarterly results for mega-cap technology giants after markets close today, with investors fearing its ad revenue could face the brunt of Apple’s iPhone privacy changes that have also hit Snap Inc’s third-quarter revenue.“After Snap got an Apple caught in its throat, markets will have an itchy trigger finger over the sell button if the social network says the same,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific at OANDA.Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc are all set to report their results later this week.Shares of the companies, which collectively account for over 22 per cent of the weighting in the S&P 500, were mixed in trading before the bell.Strong earnings updates from some companies lifted the benchmark index to an intra-day record high on Friday, driving a 5.5 per cent gain so far in October after a stumble in September.Investors are also assessing how companies are mitigating supply chain bottlenecks, labor shortages and inflationary pressures to sustain growth.Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 34.8 per cent year-on-year for the third quarter, according to data from Refinitiv.“We are seeing strong confidence with upward revisions to quarterly earnings estimates,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist, CFRA Research.“The market has regained its old highs and old highs are like rusty doors that require several attempts to swing it open, so it is going to take more sideways trading days before markets take off again.”On the economic data front, readings on US third-quarter GDP - the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge, the core PCE price index and consumer confidence data will be released later this week.At 08:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 40 points, or 0.11 per cent, S&P 500 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.16 per cent, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 36.25 points, or 0.24 per cent.Oil firms including Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil rose about 0.5 per cent each, tracking Brent crude prices to three-year high.Shares of major Wall Street lenders also edged higher.Carnival Corp slipped 1.3 per cent after Citigroup downgraded the cruise operator’s stock to “neutral” from “buy”. — Reuters",

BRUSSELS, Oct 25 — Germany, Denmark, Ireland and six other European countries said today they would not support a reform of the EU electricity market, ahead of an emergency meeting of energy ministers to discuss the recent price spike.European gas and power prices soared to record high levels in autumn and have remained high, prompting countries including Spain and France to urge Brussels to redesign its electricity market rules.Nine countries on Monday poured cold water on those proposals, in a joint statement that said they “cannot support any measure that conflicts with the internal gas and electricity market” such as an overhaul of the wholesale power market.“As the price spikes have global drivers, we should be very careful before interfering in the design of internal energy markets,” the statement said.“This will not be a remedy to mitigate the current rising energy prices linked to fossil fuels markets.”Austria, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Latvia and the Netherlands signed the statement, which called instead for more measures to save energy and a target for a 15 per cent interconnection of the EU electricity market by 2030.European energy ministers meet tomorrow to discuss their response to the price spike. Most countries are using tax cuts, subsidies and other national measures to shield consumers against the impact higher gas prices are having on energy bills, but EU governments are struggling to agree on a longer term response.Spain has led calls for a revamp of the wholesale power market in response to the price spike, arguing that the system is not supporting the EU’s green transition.Under the current system, the wholesale electricity price is set by the last power plant needed to meet overall demand for power. Gas plants often set the price in this system, which Spain said was unfair as it results in cheap renewable energy being sold for the same price as costlier fossil fuel-based power.The European Commission has said it will investigate whether the EU power market is functioning well, but that there is no evidence to suggest a different system would have better protected countries against the surge in energy costs. — Reuters",

    "content": "The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Ethiopia. Photo by Gallo Images/Orbital Horizon/Copernicus Sentinel Data 2020Since Ethiopia announced the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in 2011, there have been disagreements between Egypt and Ethiopia on the filling and operation of the dam. With turbines of about 5100 MW it has more than two times the energy generating power of the nearest major hydropower dam – the High Aswan Dam in Egypt which was commissioned 50 years ago. Ethiopia, as an upstream country in the Nile basin, contributes the lion’s share of the Nile waters. It’s three tributaries – the Blue Nile, Sobat, and Atbara – carry about 86% of the total flow in the Nile. With a population of more than 100 million it is singularly dependent on the Nile River for its freshwater needs. According to the Nile Waters Agreement of 1959 between Egypt and Sudan, Egypt receives an annual average flow of 55.5 km3/year (about 75% of flow coming from Ethiopia). Thus, the GERD project challenges Egypt’s historical hegemonic position on the Nile basin. And it aspires to project the power of Ethiopia on Nile water sharing. Beyond the escalated tensions and the complexity of politics among the Nile countries, a key question is: what effects will GERD have on securing the future water supply in the Nile basin and the region? This question inspired my PhD research. My findings shed light on different pathways that could curtail the challenges imposed by GERD while ensuring the development goals of all countries. They are informed by the insight that a lack of data – such as operating policy or storage plans – hinders the management and operation of reservoirs. Countries having this data, and sharing it with their neighbours would be a game changer. My work focused on the High Aswan Dam and GERD as typical paradigms of large hydropower dams in a transboundary basin. The pathways introduced in my PhD research answer the following questions: Can satellite observations with hydrologic modelling be used to understand dam operation in the Nile River Basin? How can the High Aswan Dam adapt its operation to the filling and operation of the GERD? What is the value of streamflow forecasts in improving High Aswan Dam operation? How can we take advantage of the existing models and data to build an operational system that supports decision making in the Nile river basin? Pathways Pathway 1: Monitoring dam operation from space: In one of my studies, we explored the integration of hydrological modelling with the satellite earth observations over the Nile basin as a way to monitor the operation of dams. This offers the opportunity to overcome the challenge of data sharing among Nile countries. This challenge is particularly evident in transboundary rivers shared between developing nations. More often than not neighbouring countries don’t share reservoir operating policies or storage plans. The success of this satellite-based framework will have significant implications for policy makers. It will supply them with timely information about dam operations. In turn this will help them make more informed decisions about a wide array of water management issues. Pathway 2: Adapting to future challenges The High Aswan Dam is known as the faucet that controls the only source of surface water in Egypt. Its operation is based on the assumption that most of the Blue Nile flow will contribute to its power production and water supply. A lack of provision to adapt to GERD filling and operations will make inflow less predictable. It is important therefore for Egypt to understand what changes GERD will bring to its water security. In particular it needs to know how the High Aswan Dam will have to adapt its operation to impending challenges. In a recent study, we proposed an adaptive approach for the High Aswan Dam. It could change its seasonal operation by storing more water during the summer in lieu of historically releasing water during the high flow season (June through September). Pathway 3: Harnessing forecasts to predict and improve dam operations Predicting future climate can help make efficient adaptive operating decisions. For example, if a dam operator is informed about a coming dry year they can take early action by storing more water to offset the expected reduction in river flow. A Forecast-based Adaptive Reservoir Operation (FARO; pronounced “Pharaoh”) framework is proposed to integrate streamflow forecasts in deriving adaptive operating policy. This presents another opportunity to translate research into practice by predicting the GERD inflow (12 months ahead) and plan in advance for the operation of High Aswan Dam. The developed FARO framework demonstrated that using forecast information can yield a significant improvement in the High Aswan Dam operation under different conditions. Pathway 4: Develop user-ready decision support systems. Taking advantage of free satellite observations, available globally at high spatial and temporal resolutions, I operationalised the results of my research work through a web portal system. It aims to advance societal impacts by converting the results from the scientific research into a sound decision support system. The system integrates complex back-end models with front-end user needs. Integrating the outcomes of scientific research results into the system will: promote the societal applications of various water-related satellite/forecast products in the Nile basin; communicate the potential of such products to understand water management issues; and provide a real-time tool forward to facilitate the negotiations for new dam plans. Pathway 5: Promote training and capacity building. Building the skills of people in the riparian countries is key to understand the existing tools and models and thus cope with future challenges. The outcomes of a workshop I arranged recently saw more than 20 attendees from the Nile River countries (particularly from Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia) build their skills with satellite remote sensing datasets. Discussions and feedback from the attendees help promote the ongoing research efforts and therefore lead to more practice-oriented outcomes. Path forward The transboundary GERD dam, with its large storage capacity in the Upper Blue Nile, will gradually tip the balance of the Nile water sharing in Ethiopia’s favour. The politics around the Nile river is further complicated by the different factors involved in making decisions amid riparian countries. Thus, communicating the scientific findings is a potential route to reach common ground and avoid political tensions in the Nile region. The pathways presented here highlight opportunities to integrate scientific research into the ongoing negotiations. They provide a tangible way forward for existing dams to adapt their operations to real-world transboundary challenges while considering the equitable rights of development in the riparian countries. Further, the results from my models and tools can benefit the ongoing multilateral negotiations and turn conflict into cooperation.

[+] gas and oil extraction using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is on the verge of a boom on March 24, 2014 near Lost Hills, California. Critics of fracking in California cite concerns over water usage and possible chemical pollution of ground water sources as California farmers are forced to leave unprecedented expanses of fields fallow in one of the worst droughts in California history. Concerns also include the possibility of earthquakes triggered by the fracking process which injects water, sand and various chemicals under high pressure into the ground to break the rock to release oil and gas for extraction though a well. The 800-mile-long San Andreas Fault runs north and south on the western side of the Monterey Formation in the Central Valley and is thought to be the most dangerous fault in the nation. Proponents of the fracking boom saying that the expansion of petroleum extraction is good for the economy and security by developing more domestic energy sources and increasing gas and oil exports. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Getty Images President Biden will attend the global climate treaty talks in Glasgow, Scotland starting this week. And other industrialized nations are concerned about whether the United States has created the policy framework to achieve net-zero carbon goals by 2050. Given that the power sector contributes the most CO2 in this country, is it moving fast enough to green itself? This question goes to the heart of President Biden’s infrastructure and climate proposal . Experts say that the pace of change is too slow to achieve the goals of COP26, which are to limit temperature increases and to avoid the worst possible effects of climate change. But others worry that an ill-considered blueprint to achieve carbon neutrality will backfire. Witness Europe, which has moved forward at all costs and which is now short natural gas. “The market is not configured on this transition,” says Arshad Mansoor, chief executive of the Electric Power Research Institute, during a virtual conference held by the United States Energy Association on Friday. “The reason we have this much wind and solar is because of incentives,” he continued, in response to this reporter’s question who served as a panelist. “It needs to change more urgently. We are seeing changes but not at the speed we need.” President Biden’s objective is to generate 80% clean energy by 2030 and 100% by 2035. He says that a $23 trillion economy will be created as a result. Power companies contribute about 39% of all CO2 emissions in the United States. The president’s plan would reward utilities that make the switch to cleaner generation — everything from deploying renewables and battery storage to building nuclear plants and carbon capture and storage. Natural gas has done most of the heavy lifting, so far, by replacing coal that has nearly twice the emissions. To be clear, getting to net-zero does not mean the abolition of fossil fuels ; rather, it means offsetting their emissions. Electrification of the economy is critical: today, 20% of all energy used in homes and industry is electric, says Mansoor. But that number could potentially be as high as 60% in 2050. To that end, the electric grid must be modernized or expanded to manage the increased demand: four-times more renewables and an electric transport sector, which is now responsible for 30% of all CO2 releases.

Sustained global warming shows no sign of letting up according to new analysis by the World Meteorological Organization made public at the climate talks in Copenhagen. Although global temperature fluctuates from year to year, overall the decade of the 2000s is likely the warmest decade in the past 150 years covered by the report. This decade is warmer than the 1990s which were warmer than the 1980s, and so on. The conclusion meshes with independent analysis by the National Climatic Data Center and NASA. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Getty Images According to S&P Global Market Intelligence , 70% of the largest U.S. electric and gas utilities now have net-zero goals: Alliant, Ameren, American Electric Power , CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy, Edison International, Exelon Corp, PPL Corp., Sempra Energy, Southern Company, and Xcel Energy are some of the leaders. The shift to electrification means more sales and greater revenues for utilities. But it also means more investment. What is the role of government? “Our electric demand has been relatively flat even as society and the economy has grown,” says Branco Terzic, managing director of BRG. “Now we add the electric vehicles. We are grappling with making the transition and then having to add new capacity. If we put the incentives in the wrong place, we will get the wrong result … The transition from fossil fuels will be painful and expensive.” The United States has reduced its annual energy-related CO2 releases by 14% since 2005 — even as the U.S. economy has grown by 28%. Think about that: the traditional argument is that environmental rules constrain the economy. But if the investments in environmental improvements lead to new industries such as wind, solar, and electric vehicles, then that paradigm is changing. But proper planning is a must. Europe, for example, has been single-minded about reducing its CO2 emissions and it has thus increased the amount of wind and solar it generates. But enter the perfect storm: COVID-induced supply chain disruptions, calmer winds in the North Sea, and shortages of coal and natural gas. And now the Europeans could be at the mercy of the Russians and Gazprom that just completed the Nord Stream II gas pipeline that empties into Germany’s Baltic coast. In 2020, the United States exported 5.28 trillion cubic feet of LNG to 32 countries. While it’s the highest on record, it’s just a small part of Europe’s total. “Natural gas plays far too important of a role,” says Suriya Jayanti, international energy counsel for the U.S. Department of Commerce. “We can’t stop investing in it overnight. It has to be phased out. Coal is the obvious choice (to go.)” She adds that energy companies make 30-year investments in plants based on economic reasoning and by extension, environmental externalities. That is, they understand that the transition to a low-carbon future is real. Therefore, they don’t let the current “political bickering” impede their business blueprints. But where does that leave natural gas in a world trying to achieve net-zero by 2050? The Right Job U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, speaks during a news conference on ... [+] climate change outside of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 20, 2021. The Senate majority leader said Tuesday that Democrats want a deal this week on a new framework for passing the White House's economic agenda. Photographer: Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg © 2021 Bloomberg Finance LP In 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says that the electric power sector accounted for about 38% of total U.S. natural gas consumption. Moreover, the natural gas pipelines can also transport hydrogen — up to 20% by volume. The goal is not to leave any stranded infrastructure and to possibly retrofit those systems to meet the needs of a low-carbon world. Natural gas is also used to firm up wind and solar when the weather does not permit it. If it replaces all the coal plants in the world, that would displace 6 billion tons of CO2 . “Companies want to build pipeline and facilities,” says Sheila Hollis, Acting Executive Director for the United States Energy Association. “They want an opportunity in the international market. But reality strikes when you try to slog through the regulatory process. When you get down in the trenches of this battle, it is heavily lawyered and hard-fought. It is a tremendous slog to get to ‘yes.’ Then it goes through the appellate process. After 10 years, they may throw in the towel.” Where does this leave U.S. policymakers, who are intent to vote along party lines? Is the United States moving fast enough to reach its net-zero targets? Should utilities be given even more incentives to make the transition even faster? Or, should the United States move more cautiously? Should the U.S. stifle domestic shale production? Or should it encourage development and export the fuel to help feed energy starvation and to displace coal usage both at home and abroad? The natural gas industry says that the transition to net-zero will take at least 30 years. Even then, the aim is “less gas” as opposed to “no gas.” Moreover, the American Gas Association says that natural gas systems deliver three times more energy on the coldest days of the year than does the electric system on the hottest days. Freezing temperatures and no heat are unthinkable. The International Energy Agency , however, is calling for no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects and for “the immediate and massive deployment” of clean technologies. Solar photovoltaic installations should reach 630,000 megawatts by 2030 while wind energy should hit 390,000 megawatts — four times the record set in 2020. Energy efficiency improvements, too, are vital — enough to reduce energy use by 4% a year through 2030. And carmakers should only build electric vehicles by 2035. The drive toward clean energy and net-zero is steady and strong. But as it stands now, the United States cannot meet the timelines set by COP26 . It can get a lot done with the current policies and technologies. But to do the job right, more motivation and more funding is critical — everything from energy efficiency to renewables to electric vehicles. Until then, natural gas will have a key role in this country and it will remain at the core of any well-planned energy transition.",

But that has changed; the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2025 renewable energy will overtake coal as the largest source of electricity generation in the world. And the cost of building wind, solar, and energy storage plants is falling. This creates a huge tailwind for renewable energy stocks that can build a large, profitable business. While there are certainly risks -- as longtime renewable energy followers know -- three of our contributors think First Solar ( NASDAQ:FSLR ) , Brookfield Renewable Partners ( NYSE:BEPC ) , and Equinor ( NYSE:EQNR ) are set to thrive for at least the next three decades. Image source: Getty Images. The solar giant left standing Travis Hoium (First Solar): Few companies have lasted as long in the solar industry as First Solar. The thin-film solar panel manufacturer was founded in 1999 and has been a leading solar company since then. You can see below that First Solar has been profitable for most of the last decade outside of a couple of years when it was upgrading manufacturing facilities to its newest technology. FSLR Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts As tumultuous as the last decade has been for solar companies and solar panel manufacturers in particular, the industry has settled into a fairly mature state. Most major manufacturers have large scale and technology advances are happening much more slowly than a decade ago -- and that's good for established companies. Profit margins are rising and the threat of new entrants into the industry is falling. At the same time, the solar industry is growing and the need for solar panels is increasing. To meet demand, First Solar will double production over about the next three years with much of that expansion coming in the U.S. And that should further improve the company's industry-leading profitability. There's no doubt that the next 30 years will bring more volatility to the solar industry, but First Solar has proven its ability to adapt and grow. As solar energy grows, I think First Solar will, too, and that's why it's my pick to buy and hold for long-term investors. A value investment approach with growth-like results Howard Smith (Brookfield Renewable): Many people don't think about investments with a 30-year time horizon. But perhaps they should. Building wealth and a retirement nest egg takes decades. With that in mind, a core investment should focus on management as well as the future prospects of the business. And it should include both risk and diversity. Brookfield Renewable is majority owned by the well-known Canadian asset manager Brookfield Asset Management ( NYSE:BAM ) and has deep operational experience with those roots. Investors can own the renewables business through the legacy publicly traded partnership shares and more recently with Brookfield Renewable Corporation, which avoids getting a Schedule K-1 for U.S. investors at tax time. But either entity gets an investor shares in one of the world's largest renewable energy platforms . The growth in renewable energy capacity is a global trend that will last decades. Brookfield Renewable is a way to play it through experienced capital allocators that have fiscal discipline. Management has a target to provide investors 12% to 15% total returns including 5% to 9% annual distribution growth. Over the past three years, as the use of renewable energy assets has become more commonplace, Brookfield Renewable shares have exceeded management's target. BEP data by YCharts But so far in 2021, a decline in price has given investors a better opportunity to become owners. Shares are down more than 15% year to date, and are more than 25% off early January highs. The majority of the company's assets are with hydroelectric power, but in the first six months of 2021, wind generation was the largest growth segment. Wind capacity almost tripled, helping total electricity generation increase 11.5% compared to the prior year period. Funds from operations grew almost 5% in that period versus the first six months of 2020. For investors looking decades down the road, it makes sense to have a piece of a growing sector like renewable energy. And letting experienced managers invest your capital in hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage facilities is a responsible way to play it. In 2050, Equinor could look nothing like it does today Daniel Foelber (Equinor): It can be mind-boggling to ponder how different our day-to-day lives will be one, two, and especially three decades into the future. Thirty years ago, Google and Amazon didn't exist. The personal computer and internet were in their infancy. And renewable energy costs were too expensive to compete with fossil fuels. Times have changed. Energy companies are having their time in the sun with oil and gas prices hovering around seven-year highs. But the long-term future for renewable energy looks brighter than ever . Norwegian oil giant Equinor is the only integrated major that has produced a positive total return over the last three years. And for good reason. EQNR Total Return Level data by YCharts Equinor's low cost of production, high profit margins, and dominant position in the North Sea give it a nimble portfolio that generates a ton of free cash flow. But Equinor has been drilling the North Sea for around 50 years, and that means much of the low-hanging fruit has dried up. The stage is set for Equinor to pivot in a new direction . It has chosen offshore wind energy , which is a great fit due to Equinor's experience with offshore production, the shallow depth of the Norwegian continental shelf, and the high barriers in offshore wind energy versus onshore wind and solar. By 2030, Equinor plans to allocate around half of its growth capital toward low-carbon investments. Whether it's carbon capture and storage or offshore wind, there's a good chance that Equinor will be more of a renewable energy company in 2050 than an oil and gas company. What makes Equinor an attractive stock to buy now is that it's funding its long-term renewable energy investments with an attractively positioned oil and gas portfolio that should thrive over the short to medium term. Equinor stock has quietly gained 60% year to date, but it still looks like a good buy for investors interested in the long-term thesis. Riding the renewable energy tailwinds Renewable energy should continue to grow for the foreseeable future and will likely overtake all other sources of energy worldwide. That's an incredible trend for investors to follow and that's why we think First Solar, Brookfield Renewable, and Equinor have a bright future ahead of them.",

But a lot of investors might be surprised to find out that one of Amazon's hottest new products isn't a thing at all; it's a person, namely you . In this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass , recorded on Oct. 5 , Fool contributors Jason Hall and Jose Najarro talk about Amazon's fast-growing advertising business. In short, Amazon is leveraging its huge user base into a way to make more money, and the strategy is working very well. Jason Hall: Let's start with the lead. Facebook all over the news. I'm not sure if either of you guys had a chance to watch any of the congressional hearings with what's going on at Facebook. They're very real, very serious questions about the company's focus on younger users. Here's the thing. I don't want to get too deep on this. Frankly, this is a really popular stock in The Motley Fool universe. It's recommended in a lot of services. Instead of spending an hour beating up Facebook, which we could do, here's the bottom line: Facebook's users are not its customers. If you invest in the company, if used the service, you have to have a tacit understanding of that. Its users are the products, the Facebook advertisers are its customers. Let's have a little fun here. Instead of focusing on Facebook or one of you might pick Facebook here. What is your favorite stock that its users are actually the product? Jose, you want to go first? Jose Najarro: Sure, Jason, mine is actually going to be a little bit not your typical answer. I'm pretty sure some of the people watching the show can already think of some names, but I'm going to go with Amazon on this one. Amazon, not their whole market, the consumer or the users not the product. Hall: This is becoming like a growing part of their business, that's the key here. Najarro: Definitely. This is becoming a growing part of Amazon and that is through Amazon advertising. If you give me a quick second to just share my screen real quick, you are having an image of Amazon's ad revenue in year-over-year change in the past quarters. We can see in quarter one of 2021, this was about $6.9 billion. Obviously, quarter four with all the holiday season coming up that's usually the strongest sense in any type of advertisement company. For Facebook and all the other leaders, quarter four tends to be the strongest where we can see this year-over-year growth. Some of us and originally me, I was just thinking of the way their advertisement would be through their e-commerce. I went to Amazon and I went to laptops, just post laptops. We can see some of the first few items available to me were sponsored ads. That's one way they do the advertisement. But some other things that Amazon has, they have their video series. They have Amazon Video, I believe it's called there's the paid subscription version of it or you also get a free version where you get some ads. If you are some business, if you want to start branding, you can go to Amazon ads and start doing TV streaming ads on them. Another part is they have very similar to Facebook, who has Facebook gaming, and some of the other leaders that do a lot of online gaming streaming. Amazon owns Twitch, which is the gaming. It used to be mainly for gaming, now it's a lot of podcasts, a lot of live-streaming shows happening there. Again, you can go there to do Twitch advertisement. Finally, I want to to say, they have numerous service, their music service. If you don't go with the paid subscription, you can get some advertisement behind it. This is a pretty interesting one like you mentioned Jason perfectly, it's a growing market for Amazon right now where this wasn't the route it was going when it first started selling its books. But now that it has all these users available to it, the users are definitely becoming, another product for Amazon so thought was definitely interesting to share. Hall: It is, and the interesting thing about it too, a lot of folks might not realize that traditional retailers have had something similar to this in the past, and that's product placement revenue. Where a company will literally by shelf space. They get the premium space, they pay a premium to get access to that space on a retailer shelf. But it's turbo charged for Amazon because every time you go to Amazon, you do a search. [laughs] If you are buying from Amazon, you go to Amazon and then you search for the product. Sometimes, you still might search for Google and then click on the Amazon link. But at any rate, you type it in, and guess what happened? You just built shelf space for [laughs] that products. Literally every single products that Amazon sells, they can sell premium shelf space with their ad model and it is, how lucrative is that almost $7 billion dollars in Q1 revenue compared to going back three years ago, it was a couple of billion dollars they've grown that so fast.",

Successful applicants will have access to an allocated fund of $10 million, to supercharge the adoption of the Protocol, and realize new possibilities for HUMAN technology across new use cases. HUMAN Protocol is an open-source infrastructure. It is a beginning – a new way to represent and verify human value and contribution – that can be built upon. With each new application, the diversity of work processed by the Protocol expands, and the utility of the HMT token as a means to represent all forms of contribution increases.

[+] HACHE / AFP) (Photo by VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Ever since co-founding the global nonprofit organization Water.org in 2009, Hollywood movie star Matt Damon has made it his mission to bring safe, cost-effective drinking water and sanitation to developing countries. Today, Water.org announces a new partnership with Crypto.com to raise funds and awareness for their ongoing humanitarian efforts. Founded in 2016, Crypto.com is the fastest growing cryptocurrency platform in the world. With this new partnership, the global leader has decided to make a $1 million dollar donation to Water.org, as well as launch initiatives to encourage its more than 10 million Crypto.com users to get involved in making a difference in the lives of others. “First of all, the donation is obviously huge and we’ll put that money right to work,” Damon tells me exclusively at Forbes. “When Crypto.com approached me about collaborating with them, I immediately saw the parallels to what we do at Water.org because our work is built on financial solutions. You get this up-and-coming company that has a social conscience and is just all in with what we’re doing and they see alignment with the aspect of helping people solve their problems. We’re excited about the partnership.” Matt Damon alongside his Water.org Co-Founder Gary White. Water.org Over the past 12 years since the formation of Water.org, Damon, his co-founder Gary White, and their team have strived to end the global water crisis and have already made extraordinary strides.

In fact, independent research has cited that there are 500 to 700 million people who could be reached just with this solution alone, which we call water credit which is all about micro-loaning. Crypto gave us this great donation, which is amazing. The money that I make for the commercials to promote them, I give 100% of that to Water.org as well. So, it’s millions of dollars coming in to us. The thing that we really are proud of with what we’re doing and where it relates to Crypto.com is the self-determination piece, because it’s about giving people more power. It’s about just creating an environment where people can help themselves.” A clean water pump supported by Water.org Water.org While people in many parts of the world have never had to question their access to clean drinking water, there remains large sections of the world that continue to have limited to no access to quality water systems, something Damon and his Water.org team are working to change. So, I asked Damon what should people like myself in developed countries understand more about the global water crisis, and what can we do in our everyday lives to help make an impactful difference. “That’s a great question. That is like the central issue for us and one of the biggest problems we have with messaging is that it’s really hard to relate to if you come from the West. I’ve never been more than 20 steps away from a fresh drink of water and neither have you and neither has anybody. We all have credible plumbing. We’ve got a kitchen sink, we’ve got a bathroom sink, the water in our toilets is cleaner than a billion people have access to. So, the first hurdle for us to clear is to just try to help people like us who grew up in our culture and the way we are to kind of understand the magnitude of the problem and then for us, it’s we direct them towards Water.org to hopefully get engaged and start learning about it and start to see that even a small donation can really go a long way. You might not think that a $5 donation is much, but it’s incredibly meaningful to the person whose life you’re changing.” Matt Damon with local children in the Zambian village of Africa. Water.org While setbacks from Covid-19 continue to occur all across the world for all of us in our own ways, the developing regions that Water.org is working to bring life-saving resources to are seeing some of the most damaging effects from this ongoing pandemic. “We got hit with Covid like everybody else,” Damon continues. “Think about the first thing they said when the Covid reality dawned on all of us. It was wash your hands, right? We took for granted that we had access to safe water to wash our hands with. I mean, for a billion people, that’s not the case. Then you add to that the gathering of water, which they have to go and stand and gather at a collection point. That’s putting their health at risk. So yeah, it was a very big disrupter for us and continues to be.” Damon also realizes that the Covid-19 pandemic and the global water crisis are not the only factors in play right now that are directly affecting the future of Water.org’s effectiveness in bringing safe water to people and places in need. “Climate change is a big issue for us because it threatens to undo a lot of the work that we’ve done and it really threatens water security for everybody, but the poorest people on Earth are going to be the communities that get hit the worst and get hit first. That’s a big concern for us.” Damon goes on to say that he credits his mother Nancy for his initial interest in helping others and understanding the world better, calling his travels with her as a young boy in the late 1980s a gift and the best thing she could have done. During their early visits to developing countries was when Damon first witnessed the disastrous effects that poverty and an inaccessibility to clean drinking water can have on a community. Water.org Co-Founders Matt Damon and Gary White visiting a town in India. Water.org Damon has recently followed in his mother’s compassionate footsteps by introducing his own children to his mission of providing his fellow man with the necessary tools to be able to lead their own productive and healthy lives. As I wrapped up our conversation, I asked Damon how is he able to balance his commitments to Water.org, his consistent Hollywood projects, and his home life priorities, all at the same time. “Those are the three things that I really spend my life doing. These parts of my life kind of all fold into each other. My kids are old enough now that I can take them on, if I’m going on a trip for Water.org. I brought my 15-year-old to the Philippines, I brought my oldest daughter to Indonesia, and to start to introduce them to the work we’re doing and give them some context to the kind of world they live in and where their place is in the world. I’m happy to spend time with all three of those things, between Water.org, between my day job, and my family. That’s a full life.”",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin So much writing about wine, from critics to journalists to marketing content, is geared toward “pre-wine.” Anticipating the wine, that is, and persuading consumers to buy it and communicating the narrative of what it took to bring the wine to your table. Lately, however, I’ve been wondering about the “post-wine.” What happens next, that is, after we’ve poured a glass or two and enjoyed our fill. How about the post-wine experience, for you? Do you make a note of it? Did you enjoy it, or hate it, so much that you’re compelled to share your experience on social media? Does it make you want to chase down other wines or projects by the same winemaker? Do you place an order with a retailer for more of the same? Or (and this would be the worst-case scenario for just about anyone on the production side) you’re indifferent to the experience of the wine, and have forgotten about it by the next morning? All of those scenarios are possible, and most if not all of them have happened to each of us wine enthusiasts. Which is why I’m curious to tease out the details of notable post-wine scenarios I’ve experienced recently: with so much attention paid to getting wine into consumers’ glasses, perhaps we should also consider what happens next, after the wine is gone. Once the wine has been experienced, what does the consumer do with its memory? Here are the first two, of four, recent scenarios that shed a little bit of light on the lingering memory of wine. Photo taken in Moscow, Russia getty MORE FOR YOU Hendrick’s Gin And Katz’s Delicatessen Announce An Unusual Collaboration Bubby’s Chef Ron Silver Shares His Secrets For Perfect Pancakes This Northwest Brewery Has A Brilliant Side Hustle Food and Wine Pairing: Recipe Tracing A few weeks ago, during dinner at John J. Jeffries restaurant inside the Lancaster Arts Hotel, Chef Sean Cavanaugh served his kabocha sweet potato soup paired with the 2020 Cassel Vineyards Dry Vidal Blanc. Both food and wine were sourced locally, when “local” means southern central Pennsylvania, and the components of the pairing were so in sync with each other, and so frankly surprising, that it quieted everyone at the table. I enjoyed the wine on its own, and I enjoyed the soup on its own. But together, the duet soared. Which makes the first post-wine observation significant for its long-later “finish.” I still think of that soup, weeks afterward. I trace the recipe and the scent of it through the farmers market — kabocha squash? coconut milk? was the spice saffron or turmeric or both? And what was it about the wine — the vidal blanc from that particular producer — that decided to be so friendly to those ingredients? That pairing registered at the sensory level, and the post-wine memory of it triggers my curiosity. If there’s a marker of post-wine success, the trigger of lingering curiosity about it could be first in line. Embedding the Experience Even Deeper A neighbor in Atlanta, where we live, recently turned me on to a nearby boutique called Press Shop. “Visited today and immediately thought of you,” she texted me. “They have a curated selection of books, plants, wines and beautiful stationery from their small printing press.” She was spot on in her recommendation. I walked through the Press Shop’s door the next day and walked out with a “zz plant” ( Zamioculcas zamiifolia , which now sits just inside our front door at home), a set of fun note cards, and a book, namely Whereabouts: A Novel , the newest offering by Jhumpa Lahiri, which she wrote in Italian (not her native language) and translated herself into English. But no wine? Press Shop offers three of four of my favorite things, and the one I left without purchasing (wine) somehow nonetheless makes it into this article. Here’s why: earlier that day I had participated in a virtual tasting featuring red wines from the Alto Adige region of Italy, and there were two examples of the schiava grape, one from a producer called Kellerei Bozen and the other from Manincor, that I knew I wanted to revisit that evening. Now I also knew that I’d be revisiting them while reading Lahiri. The post-wine memory of my initial tasting of these samples, while listening to their winemakers in Italy via Zoom, trumped my desire to pull a new bottle off Press Shop’s shelves. Instead I opted to surround a second tasting of the schiava samples with the atmosphere Lahiri creates from the language and context of Italy. It is a second marker of post-wine success, that is, the desire to embed the experience of a wine even deeper into memory by weaving additional associations into the whole cloth.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Bene Gesserit litany against fear from Dune is surprisingly good psychology. Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP Fear is the mind killer. This is the striking first line in the Bene Gesserit litany against fear. Dune fans have long been entranced by the litany’s power, and many of them have even tried to use it. In fact, Stephen Colbert shared that he was influenced by the litany himself after reading the book when he was 19 years old. “The book combed into my view of the world,” he said in his interview with Dune’s director. He’s hardly alone, prominent author Michael Chabon recently tweeted: Dune’s litany against fear may come from a work of fiction published in 1965, but it happens to be shockingly solid psychological advice. Repeated many times in the book, the litany is at the core of the Bene Gesserit order’s powers. It is also how Dune’s main character is tested: Paul Atreides’ (played by Timothée Chalamet) relationship with his own fear and his success in using the litany is how the Bene Gesserit define him as a “human” instead of an animal. The Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear: I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.

And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear starts in the amygdala which rapidly signals danger to the rest of the body, initiating the fight or flight response. In humans, our higher cognitive brain can modulate that fear based on what we’ve learned . That’s why we can enjoy fear from an amusement park haunted house. But real fear or facing life-threat has a way of shutting down our higher cognitive brain as the fight-or-flight response takes over. The brain becomes flooded by fear ; the prefrontal cortex goes quiet and incapable of strategic or complex thinking. That kind of fear can realistically be understood as a “mind-killer” because it shuts down our mind’s ability to think. Under fear’s influence, we actually default back to a more animal response than a human one. I will face my fear. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. Few themes in modern psychology and neuroscience over the last decade have been more prominent than this: that avoiding negative emotions tends to make them stronger. This is particularly true with anxiety and fear, where several important therapies are based around helping people tolerate exposure to their fear in order to gradually lessen it. In fact, research in positive psychology and the science of happiness find that sitting with our negative emotions tends to lessen them. And that actually makes us happier. Facing our fear is the way to go, but not if it floods us and triggers the “mind-killer” response. That’s why permitting fear to pass over us and through us is key. This mindfulness based action reminds us that we are separate from our fear: we can observe our fear and let is pass us by. We can experience it without being damaged by it. (Please note: this is not good advice for processing traumatic memories, which are experienced differently. Please work on trauma based fears with your therapist.) Only I will remain. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. This last step in the litany harnesses mindfulness to consolidate learning. By turning “the inner eye to see its path” we can process our experience of fear, including it’s successful resolution. That’s when we learn that “where the fear has gone there will be nothing”—the fear has truly left us. And what more powerful statement of confidence and victory can there be than this: “only I will remain.” That is what facing our fears mindfully and processing them teaches us: we remain .",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A team from the University of Zurich (UZH) has trained AI to fly a drone in a virtual environment full of obstacles before setting it loose in the real world, where it was able to weave around at 40 kph/ 25 mph, three times as fast as the previous best piloting software. Lead researcher Davide Scaramuzza, Director of the Robotics and Perception Group , says the work, carried out in parentship with Intel INTC , could revolutionize robotics by enabling machines to learn virtually. A paper describing the project, Learning high-speed flight in the wild is published this month in the journal Science Robotics. “Our approach is a stepping stone toward the development of autonomous systems that can navigate at high speeds through previously unseen environments with only on-board sensing and computation,” the paper concludes. The 'student' AU generates dozens of possible trajectories, and learns to pick the one closest to ... [+] the route chosen by the 'master' AI with its perfect knowledge of the environment and the drones speed and position UZH Scaramuzza’s group previously demonstrated the first autonomous drone able to beat human racing pilots around a course using sophisticated path planning with help from external sensors. The new work takes a somewhat different approach and is self-contained: the machine-learning AI effectively has an apprenticeship with an all-knowing master in the virtual world, and learns to imitate the master’s technique. (A bit unlike the Sparring Program in the Matrix…except that the student is an AI.) In the virtual world, the learning AI flying a drone sits alongside an expert system which has ‘privileged information,’ a detailed knowledge of the obstacles and the exact position and speed of the drone, information which would not be known in the real world. This allows the expert system to plot the optimal route around obstacles. The machine learning system generates a large number of possible routes, and as the flight progresses it learns which is the best one from the master, updating its neural network each time.

A Bizarre Mix Of Local Jets Rose To Meet It. After a large number of virtual flights, the learning AI was then ready to take on real-world flying. It was flown in difficult situations where there were branches and other obstacles, or narrow openings to negotiate, with poor visibility and limited computing power. Time lapse shows a UZH drone dodging around a tree at high speed using skills learned in a virtual ... [+] world. UZH The UZH pilot was flow against two state-of-the-art drone piloting programs. At low speeds performance was similar, but at higher speeds the other systems suffered from too much ‘latency’ – they were not able to calculate a safe route fast enough – and experienced multiple crashes. The previous software used separate modules for sensing, mapping and planning, whereas the machine-learning approach fuses all three functions and provides swifter routing. The latency of the two other systems was 65 and 19 milliseconds for a sample task, the UZH system managed 10 milliseconds. While this may not be consistent for every piloting challenge, it shows the potential of the approach. Scaramuzza notes that this is the first time such a system has been trained in a completely simulated environment and then used its learning in the physical world. While it could be useful for training delivery drones and air taxis negotiate the urban landscape in all weathers and lightning conditions – cheaply and without the risk of accidents — there may also be far greater potential. The technique suggests that guided machine learning in virtual environments could be a way of quickly and cheaply training all sports of robotic systems. For example, a robotic system for unloading boxes from trucks could get the equivalent of years of experiencing with learning how to handle awkward shapes and sizes of package. Domestic cleaning robots , which sometimes struggle with odd-shaped rooms or particular items of furniture, could get smarter with virtual training. For the immediate future, this approach is likely to be applied mainly to small drones, enabling them to carry out aggressive maneuvers faster than any human pilot. The paper indicates that even faster speeds could be achieved with better sensors and more accurate modeling; it is not clear what the absolute limits might be. You can watch a two-minute video showing how 'Learning high-speed flight in the wild' was achieved here .",

    "full_description": "IBM 's ( NYSE:IBM ) stock tumbled nearly 10% to a seven-month low on Oct. 21 after the tech giant posted a weak third-quarter report. IBM's revenue rose just 0.3% year-over-year to $17.6 billion, which missed estimates by $190 million. But excluding its divested businesses and currency exchange rates, its revenue actually declined 0.2%. Excluding its upcoming spin-off of Kyndryl, IBM's revenue increased 2.5% on a reported basis. Excluding its divested businesses and exchange rates, its \"ex-Kyndryl\" revenue rose 1.9%. Image source: IBM. IBM's GAAP earnings , which include its spin-off costs for Kyndryl, declined 34% to $1.25 per share. Its non-GAAP earnings, which exclude those costs, still fell 2% to $2.52 per share, but beat estimates by a penny. IBM's numbers were unimpressive, but they were in line with the outlook it provided at its investor briefing in early October. Did investors overreact to IBM's messy third-quarter report and create a fresh buying opportunity? Say goodbye to the \"old\" IBM Just as in its previous quarters, IBM reported its third-quarter revenue in five main segments: cloud and cognitive software, global business services, global technology services, systems, and global financing. Segment Q3 2021 Revenue Growth (YOY) Cloud & Cognitive Software $5.7 billion 1.9% Global Business Services $4.4 billion 11% Global Technology Services $6.2 billion (5.4%) Systems $1.1 billion (12.4%) Global Financing $220 million (19.8%) Source: IBM. Constant currency basis. YOY = Year-over-year. IBM's cloud and cognitive software revenue rose as the double-digit growth of its cloud-related businesses offset the flat growth of its applications business and declining revenue at its transaction processing business. Its global business services segment benefited from robust demand for its cloud, consulting, application management, and global process services. However, its global technology services unit withered again as the anemic growth of its cloud services failed to offset the ongoing decline of its managed infrastructure services segment, which will be removed by the Kyndryl spin-off. Its systems division struggled with cyclically lower sales of IBM Z and Power systems, while its financing revenue dipped amid slower demand for its financing services and sluggish sales of its used equipment. Once again, IBM's strengths couldn't offset its weaknesses -- and investors were left trying to find the bright spots across its opaque reporting segments. However, all of that could change as the \"old\" IBM fades away. Say hello to the \"new\" IBM After IBM spins off Kyndryl on Nov. 3, it will introduce four new reporting segments: consulting (29% of its revenue from continuing operations in 2020), software (42%), infrastructure (25%), and financing (2%). IBM believes these four segments will make it easier for investors to track the expansion of its higher-growth businesses. Let's review IBM's long-term expectations for the three main segments from 2022 to 2024: 2022-2024 Revenue Growth Pre-tax Profit Margin Consulting High single-digit Low teens Software Mid single-digit Nearly 30% Infrastructure Flat Mid teens Source: IBM investor briefing. IBM expects its software segment, which includes Red Hat and other hybrid cloud and AI services, to become its core growth engine. It also likely expects the streamlined consulting segment to fare better against nimbler IT services and consulting companies like Accenture and Globant . IBM's infrastructure business, which includes its old systems business as well as other hardware products and services, will likely remain sluggish. However, IBM's profit margin forecast suggests it will focus on streamlining the business and cutting costs to boost its margins. What does all of this mean for investors? IBM believes that after spinning off Kyndryl, it will generate \"sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth\" from 2022 to 2024. It expects that growth to be driven by the expansion of its hybrid cloud and AI services, which can be integrated with public cloud platforms like Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft 's ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) Azure. IBM likely realizes it's too late to catch up to AWS and Azure in the public cloud market, but it can still leverage its large enterprise customer base and Red Hat's open source software to develop services for the hybrid cloud, which rests between private clouds and public cloud services. Next month, IBM's investors will receive shares of Kyndryl. If they keep both stocks, they'll initially receive a combined dividend which is equivalent to IBM's current dividend -- but both companies could then cut their payouts. I believe IBM investors should sell their shares of Kyndryl right away, since it will likely struggle to keep pace with companies like Accenture, but hold on to their shares of the \"new\" IBM to see if its turnaround plans work. Is it the right time to buy IBM? That said, I don't think it's the right time to buy any new shares of IBM. The stock might seem cheap right now at 12 times forward earnings, but it still faces stiff competition from Amazon and Microsoft -- which are both expanding their public clouds into the hybrid market -- and its sluggish infrastructure business could offset the growth of its software and consulting businesses. Investors should wait for IBM to finish its spin-off and post a few quarters of improving results before believing that a turnaround is actually underway. Until then, they should buy other blue-chip tech stocks instead of Big Blue.",

    "full_description": "Facebook allegedly misled investors and masked slowing growth among critical demographics like young users in the US, according to internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen . The documents show that young people are generally spending less time on Facebook, fewer teens are signing up and many new teen accounts are duplicates as opposed to unique new users, Bloomberg reported Monday . People across age groups are also creating fewer posts, and it’s unclear to Facebook employees why all this is happening, Bloomberg said, citing Facebook’s internal research. And while Facebook has internally studied its declining popularity among young users, it’s been fairly mum on the subject in official communications with investors, the report said, an allegation that forms the basis of Haugen’s whistleblower complaint that Facebook “has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers.” Teenagers and young adults are key demographics in the advertising market as companies seek to build relationships with people before they hit their peak income and spending levels. The documents were among the tens of thousands of pages of internal reports at the company leaked by Haugen , a former employee. The internal reports formed the basis of Haugen’s formal whistleblower complaint with the Securities Exchange Commission and were handed over to the agency and to Congress , Bloomberg said. Redacted versions of the documents were then shared with a consortium of news organizations, including Bloomberg, which are expected to publish a slew of stories Monday. While Facebook’s challenges recruiting teen users onto its platform have been previously reported, the new documents reportedly show that a cohort of slightly older, “young adults” has been on the decline for almost a decade, as well. “There is a [young adult] sharing problem,” one internal report from early 2021 says, according to Bloomberg. “They are choosing other apps to share day-to-day moments and life moments.” The documents cited by Bloomberg included, among other things, a chart showing that US teenagers’ “time spent” on Facebook was down 16 percent this year compared with 2020. A series of slides also showed that young people were taking much longer to create their first Facebook account that they did previously. Most people born before 2000 created a Facebook account by age 19 or 20, the internal research said, but people born later aren’t expected to join the social network until they’re around 24 or 25, if ever, Bloomberg reported. “What should we (particularly) optimize for among young adults?” one of the reports asked, referring to users between the ages of 18 and 29, according to Bloomberg. “We don’t know enough to know.” Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne pushed back against the data in the leaked documents, saying, “Our products are still widely used by teens, but we face tough competition from the likes of Snapchat and TikTok.” “All social media companies want teens to use their services. We are no different,” Osborne continued. “That’s why we’re continuing to build new products and features that are entertaining and help teens, their friends and family stay connected to each other.” Osborne added that the company’s filings with the SEC do alert investors to its recent challenges like estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Facebook is “confident that our disclosures give investors the information they need to make informed decisions,” he told the outlet. Facebook did not immediately return The Post’s request for comment. The platform’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has denied Haugen’s allegations wholesale and said in a note to staff that media coverage of her leaks “misrepresents our work and our motives.” Another batch of the leaked documents also showed that the company has for years struggled to crack down on human trafficking-related content on the site, according to CNN . Facebook has known about human traffickers using its platforms since at least 2018, the report said. The issues spilled into public view in 2019 when Apple threated to pull Facebook and Instagram’s access to the App Store, which would have been devastating to the company. While Facebook managed to dodge the App Store ban, it continues to struggle with human-trafficking issues to this day, the documents show, according to CNN. “We prohibit human exploitation in no uncertain terms,” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone told the outlet. “We’ve been combatting human trafficking on our platform for many years and our goal remains to prevent anyone who seeks to exploit others from having a home on our platform.” Shares of Facebook were down less than 1 percent in premarket trading Monday after falling over 5 percent on Friday. The stock was last seen exchanging hands at $322.63 per share.",

That's partly because investors had become too exuberant in trading and partly because higher interest rates have hurt growth stocks. Despite the pullback, renewable energy is a booming industry and there's a lot of opportunity for investors. Three of our renewable energy contributors think SunPower ( NASDAQ:SPWR ) , Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure ( NASDAQ:AY ) , and TPI Composites ( NASDAQ:TPIC ) are great deals, with the stocks down over 25% from their 52-week highs. Image source: Getty Images. The quiet residential solar company Travis Hoium (SunPower): SunPower has gone through tremendous changes this year. The company recently announced plans to exit the commercial solar business, after exiting the utility-scale solar market and the solar manufacturing business over the last few years. SunPower also recently announced the acquisition of a residential solar installer Blue Raven Solar , meaning the company now installs solar systems itself rather than working with third-party partners to do the work. But this may be the right move long-term. SunPower has built the digital infrastructure and brand to be a top residential solar company. On the company's website you can build and price a solar installation in just a few minutes and the company has put together the infrastructure to control and monitor solar and energy storage installations. Strategically, SunPower is well positioned to succeed in residential solar and currently has the No. 2 market position behind Sunrun ( NASDAQ:RUN ) . And the stock is trading at a discount to Sunrun. In the first half of 2021, SunPower installed 204 megawatts of residential and light commercial solar, before the acquisition of Blue Raven Solar, and Sunrun installed 353 MW of solar. But SunPower's market cap of $5.1 billion is less than half of Sunrun's at $10.6 billion, so even from a valuation perspective SunPower's shares look like a value. Long-term, I think residential solar will continue to grow in the U.S. and SunPower clearly has a market-leading position. The stock may be down from highs earlier this year, but that's created a discount for investors who believe in this industry long-term. High-quality assets at a discounted price Howard Smith (Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure): In the first half of 2021, Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure reported that it grew cash available for distribution by 12.9% compared to the first six months of 2020. But shares of the renewable energy asset manager and owner haven't followed along. Atlantica shares are down almost 25% since the first week of January 2021. AY data by YCharts With shares also yielding nearly 5% , now is a good time for investors to get this income-generating investment with room for capital appreciation. Most of Atlantica's power generation comes from its renewable assets -- more than 70% of which are solar. The company also holds assets in efficient natural gas, electric transmission lines, and water capacity. The company's model is to grow by adding new assets with contracted or regulated revenue, helping to ensure a steady flow of income for investors. Shareholders can count on that income because Atlantica's portfolio of 34 power generating assets are 100% contracted, or in two cases, regulated. And there's good reason to believe invested capital can also grow, as the company continues to grow its generating assets. In the first half of 2021, Atlantica grew its megawatts in operation from its renewables segment by 30% compared to that period in 2020. For its efficient natural gas holdings, that growth rate was 16%. That, along with variations in working capital levels, helped operating cash flow soar 66%. Atlantica also operates globally, with assets in North America, South America, and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. That geographic diversity also helps provide protection from regional economic jolts. With steady income, solid prospects for continued growth, and a share price that is well off recent highs, now is a good time to add Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure as a renewable energy portfolio investment. A mid-cap wind stock that's down but not out Daniel Foelber (TPI Composites): TPI Composites has spent the last few years shifting from a small and profitable wind blade manufacturer to a global producer with a much higher manufacturing capacity . Investors cheered the strategy, hoping that TPI's investments would pay off as renewable capacity expansions reach the next inflection point. But after reaching an all-time high in February, shares of TPI have plummeted around 60% from that high, are down over 35% year to date, and are now within striking distance of a 52-week low. Without getting into too much detail, TPI's problems stem from its need to book long-term supply agreements on its new production lines, renew contracts that will expire in the next few years or find fresh buyers, and pay down debt that it's taken on to fund its growth. In its Q2 2021 conference call, TPI mentioned that it has contracts set to expire on Dec. 31, positioning the company to have fewer than 54 dedicated manufacturing lines under contract. TPI has struggled to grow its top line at a rate that justifies its valuation . After initially forecasting a profitable 2021, updated guidance suggests TPI will likely record yet another loss this year. To make matters worse, TPI now expects the wind market will be \"relatively flat\" in 2022, pointing to a longer than expected period of slow growth and uncertain profitability. Companies aren't perfect. And in today's age of supply chain constraints and multi-year renewable energy development projects, it can be easy to make inaccurate predictions. TPI's forecasts have been wrong , and the company's lackluster growth has resulted in disappointing medium-term performance. The silver lining is that TPI has effectively lowered expectations by so much that virtually any news will look good. Favorable contracts, higher than expected utilization rates from its production lines, and any improvement to growth will indicate TPI is making progress on its turnaround . Given its presence in Europe, North America, Asia, Central America, and the Middle East, along with reliable business from some of the most reputable original equipment manufacturers in the industry (like Vestas , GE , and Siemens Gamesa to name a few), TPI is a wind energy stock worth considering at these lower prices. Great buys today Pullbacks can be healthy for the stock market and in the case of SunPower, Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure, and TPI Composites this provides a great buying opportunity for investors. These companies still have a lot of growth ahead as renewable energy grows, and investors are getting a better price for these businesses than they were a few months ago.",

    "description": "Government control over public sector banks should be eased for better governance, says Rajnish Kumar.",
    "content": "Governance at public sector banks can be improved if they're managed by boards and regulatory gaps between private and public lenders are bridged, said Rajnish Kumar, former chairman, State Bank of India. \"Just as an example, I don't think it's written in the act that there would be a Department of Financial Services. A public sector bank can be managed by its board and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, as is being done for all the other banks,\" Kumar told BloombergQuint in an interview, after the launch of his new book The Custodian Of Trust.Kumar's advice to the government is to play the role of an active shareholder, like institutional shareholders do in the case of private banks. Accountability, he said, will follow. \"It's not that accountability comes only when you have direct control (of the government). It doesn't,\" Kumar said. The government had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks in the Union Budget. Legislative changes for this are pending. Apart from this, the government is looking to sell stake in IDBI Bank Ltd.Alongside privatisation, governance concerns must be addressed, said Kumar, adding that large corporate houses should not be permitted into banking.The Infrastructure BurdenIn his book, Kumar explains the problems with valuing and funding infrastructure projects and the lack of expertise in lending to this segment.Infrastructure companies which were prominent till around 2010-11 saw rapid deterioration in the following decade, he wrote in his book. While the gap in risk assessment by banks contributed to the large defaults, policies of the government and promoter impatience are also to be blamed, Kumar wrote. The introduction of a new development finance institution by the government will help resolve such problems, Kumar said during the interview.\"There is a need for a specialised institution with expertise in risk assessment and risk mitigation, so it can lead a consortium. Right now, that mantle is on SBI,\" Kumar said. The DFI is likely to have more stability since, typically, officials at SBI are required to move departments within three years, leading to a gap in supervision of infrastructure projects, he said.

But now it hopes to bring the same user-friendly features to building a mobile app. Launching new products isn't something new for Wix; the company is consistently creating new products and features. However, in this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass , recorded on Oct. 8 , Fool contributor Jason Hall and Millionacres editor Deidre Woollard discuss how important an app-building product could be for Wix in international markets. Jason Hall: I want to share, I'm trying to find the slide right now. They have this really interesting cadence of, I don't want to say this runs counter to what we were talking about earlier, but the bottom line is that when you get out of the free model and get into its premium offerings, Wix has a ton of tools and it is regularly, consistently adding to those tools. I think this is one of the things that gets to the stickiness, and if you look at its revenues, how much of it comes from creative revenues, that's the vast majority of its revenues. It's because you start off, and then you want a little bit more and you add a module. You want a little bit more, and you add more and more and you grow your relationship. Again, we talked about that net revenue retention rate was up, I think it was 113%, so there's 13% increase essentially in comps if you were to use a retail term, 13% growth in revenue from organic revenues is a great number. A big part of that is that as its customers move to that premium model, they begin to steadily add more capabilities, and Wix has made that a point. This is a company that spends a tremendous amount of money on R&D. There's another slide that I wanted to show, let me try and find it. It's about its cost structure, and I think it's really interesting to share because it talks about how they try to leverage their cash flows in different ways. I'm going to do this backwards, I'm going to start here on the right. Less than 10% of their revenues are needed to cover general and administrative expenses, so that's just like their basic baseline operations. Then in the middle, this is sales and marketing, which is ranged from as high as 43% to as low as 33% over the past three or four years, happens that those happen to be the second quarter of this year, and the second quarter of last year. You see last year, there was a clear decision made to spend more on sales and marketing in the second quarter of 2020. They were able to leverage up their marketing dollars at an obvious point in time where people were going to be building more websites in the middle of the pandemic lockdowns. You see this year, that number is the lowest that it's been for a full fiscal period and since before 2017. There's evidence that they're able to lever that up and down. Again, you see they spend between 21% and 25% on R&D. That's a really important area to spend in that prior tab that I showed with all of the different modules that they've built and they've expanded over time. That's where they spend at least a fifth of their operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, are going into R&D, and I think that's really important. That you see this isn't a number that's shrinking at a high rate, it's a number that's staying pretty high. Deidre. Deidre Woollard: Talking about some of the things that they're doing, one of the things I find really interesting is they're doing their mobile app for Dine by Wix, which is the restaurant app. You think about things like Toast that are having their IPO. If you have a Wix website, you already have some of that functionality built in. Another thing I think that's really interesting, is they are rolling out their app creation. They have this branded app by Wix thing. It's not going to be the most amazing bells and whistles app you ever saw in your life, but the idea that you can stand up your own native mobile app in a relatively short period of time, that's going to satisfy the need for a wide, wide variety of businesses. You think about all the small businesses in the United States, they don't necessarily have a lot of money to build out their web presence and build out an app presence, but if they need something quick, relatively easy to stand up, this is it. I think that's pretty appealing. Hall: Internationally, this could be huge. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of entrepreneurs around the world, that their only computing device is a mobile device, it's a smartphone. They are having the ability to stand up a website and build it out and do all your integrations from a mobile platform is very, very powerful.

    "full_description": "Halloween tries to spook you with ghosts and monsters, but often, the real nightmares that keep us up at night are far more mundane, like surprise bills or running out of money in retirement. These are real risks, but you can reduce the odds of them happening with careful planning now. Here are three retirement planning mistakes you definitely want to avoid. 1. Putting off saving Retirement sneaks up on you faster than you think, and the longer you wait to start saving, the more difficult your task becomes. If your savings is only invested for a short time before you begin spending the funds, you won't have as much earnings to help you cover your expenses. That means you'll have to set aside even more of your own money every month to reach your retirement savings goal . Image source: Getty Images. For example, if your goal is to save $1 million for retirement by the time you're 65, you'll only need to save about $403 per month if you start at 25 and earn a 7% average annual rate of return. You'll have contributed less than $200,000 yourself, which means that over $800,000 of your $1 million would come from investment earnings. But if you'd waited to begin saving until you were 30, you'd now have to save $582 per month to reach your goal, assuming the same annual rate of return. Just by waiting five years to start saving, you've now cost yourself an extra $51,000 because you won't have as much investment earnings to help you. This problem only grows more severe the longer you wait, so it's important to begin saving for retirement as soon as you can. Even if you can only set aside a few dollars each week, it's a good start. Then, increase your contributions as soon as you're able to. 2. Making early retirement account withdrawals Money you put into a retirement account is typically locked away until you turn 59 1/2. While no one will stop you from withdrawing the money sooner, the government will slap you with a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you take the money out before this age. You could also owe taxes if the money comes out of a tax-deferred account. There are some ways to get around the penalties. For example, if you're using the money for a large medical expense, higher education, or a first home purchase, you won't have to pay the 10% early withdrawal penalty, though you could still owe taxes on this money. But even if you don't face penalties, you're still setting your retirement savings back by making an early withdrawal. Just as in our example above, you'll have to save more money going forward every month in order to make up for the amount you've withdrawn. This will make reaching your retirement savings goal a lot more challenging. Seek out other ways to get the cash you need before you resort to early retirement account withdrawals. Look into loans or see if you can save the money you need by cutting spending in other areas of your life. And build up an emergency fund if you don't have one so you don't need to tap your retirement savings to help with unplanned bills. 3. Choosing the wrong time to pay taxes on your savings The retirement account you choose determines when you pay taxes on your savings. There are two main types: tax-deferred and Roth. Tax-deferred contributions give you a tax break this year, but then you must pay taxes on your retirement account withdrawals. Roth contributions don't reduce your tax bill this year, but your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. While both types can help you save money on taxes, one is usually a better fit than the other. Tax-deferred accounts are usually the smarter choice for those who think they're in a higher tax bracket now than they'll be in once they retire. By deferring their tax bill until retirement, they'll lose a smaller percentage of their income to the government. But those who believe they're in the same or a lower tax bracket now than they will be in once they retire are usually better off paying taxes upfront with a Roth account. Choosing the right type of retirement account can help you avoid paying the government more of your savings than you need to. But if you think you've chosen the wrong type of account, that doesn't mean you're stuck with the way things are. You can always open a new retirement account that's taxed the other way and start putting some of your savings there. You might also be able to do a Roth IRA conversion to change some of your tax-deferred savings into Roth savings. However, if you do this, you'll owe taxes on the amount you're converting this year. Avoiding the three above mistakes will go a long way toward helping you remain financially secure in retirement. If you're still making one of these errors, now's a great time to make a change. Try some of the tips above and then check back in with yourself in a year or so to see how you're progressing toward your goal.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin RALEIGH, NC - MARCH 17: A general view of the the tip-off between the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles and ... [+] the North Carolina Tar Heels. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images) Getty Images The National Collegiate Athletic Association has a bad track record when it comes to complying with federal antitrust laws. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the NCAA’s efforts to limit the number of games that individual member colleges could play on television violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Earlier this year, the Court again held that the NCAA violated antitrust law when it capped the amount of educational benefits that it allowed colleges to provide to their athletes. And now, the NCAA — in yet its latest legal faux pas — is trying to limit who can advise college basketball players about their professional draft prospects. These latest actions also likely violate antitrust law. At present, professional sports agents are subject to all different types of regulation. There is federal law, most notably the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act . There is state law, often in the form of the Uniform Athlete Agents Act. And there is agent regulation from professional sports players unions, which emerges from the union’s prima facie right to control who may bargain on behalf of athletes over their player contracts pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act. Yet, despite all of these layers of sports agent regulations, the teams within a given sports league cannot typically limit who can advise their athletes on career prospects. Not only would it be unseemly for those who make money from an athlete’s labor to seek to limit who may provide such athletes with career advice, but also such an agreement among individual sports teams to concertedly refuse to deal with any given sports agent sounds a lot like an illegal group boycott that would run afoul to Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The same, of course, may reasonably be said about colleges’ centralized efforts to control who can provide advisory services to their athletes via a national trade association, the NCAA. Indeed, much as it would seem absurd under antitrust laws for colleges to collectively attempt to limit who can provide any other service to their students (imagine a group of colleges attempting to limit who their students may hire for medical treatment, dental work, or to provide standardized test preparation), it likely an illegal group boycott under Section 1 of the Sherman Act for NCAA member colleges to come together and impose a list of approved player agents. And yet, astoundingly, this is exactly what the NCAA announced that it is planning to do, as the monopolist college sports trade association is now requiring prospective college athlete player agents to pay certification fees and pass a mandatory exam before advising any college basketball player on their prospects of turning professional.

Without any legal power to sanction to agent, the NCAA may very well seek to ban the athlete who received such services. And, at that point, either the player, his agent, or both will file an antitrust challenge against the NCAA member schools. Any reasonable antitrust attorney would recognize the risk of this happening. But, still, the NCAA seems to prefer to play legal chicken with its athletes and their prospective player agents by attempting to regulate player agents that are already being permissibly regulated by both state agencies and professional sports players unions. More likely than not, this game of chicken will not end well for the NCAA. In the interim, the NCAA’s newest approach to player agents may also cause harm to certain college athletes. ____________ Marc Edelman ( Marc@MarcEdelman.com ) is a Professor of Law at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, Sports Ethics Director of the Robert Zicklin Center on Corporate Integrity, and the founder of Edelman Law .

    "full_description": "A few days before Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) reported third-quarter earnings, I decided to buy some shares. While the latest round of numbers looks strong, with global streaming paid memberships reaccelerating to 9.4% year over year, my decision had nothing to do with short-term performance. Rather, I was encouraged with where Netflix is clearly headed over the long term. With a recent hit like Squid Game , Netflix is proving it can cross cultural boundaries and appeal universally to everyone. It seems that Netflix's quest to dominate the global streaming market is only just beginning. Image source: Getty Images. Global appeal Netflix spent $12.5 billion on content last year, but that was a light year for the streamer given the production delays during the pandemic. Nonetheless, its recent expenditure is about to pay off big. Netflix expects 67 million households to watch the limited series Maid , which launched on Oct. 1 and follows comparable engagement numbers for season five of La Casa de Papel ( Money Heist ) and season three of Sex Education . One highlight from the third-quarter earnings report that has me excited about Netflix's future is how the company's international expansion efforts continue to drive engagement back home for viewers in the U.S. The success of the Spanish crime drama Money Heist is a good example, but Netflix just scored an even bigger hit with the Korean series Squid Game . Squid Game released in September and has become Netflix's biggest hit ever, with a staggering 142 million households watching in the first four weeks. The show has been ranked No. 1 across 94 countries, including the U.S., and management sees high demand for related consumer products stemming from its surging popularity. Whatever dollar figure Netflix spent to make Squid Game is going to come back many times over when considering the free marketing it gets across social media and spin-off skits on Saturday Night Live . It's natural for people to want to seek out and watch the shows that all their friends are talking about, and that's a key factor that fuels subscriber growth. Netflix has been doing this for years with shows like House of Cards , The Crown , The Queen's Gambit , and Stranger Things , and the valuable data it has on viewers' preferences should inform many more in the future. Turning a profitable corner Netflix has a strong content slate for the fourth quarter, with several popular series returning, including The Witcher , Cobra Kai , and the final chapter of Money Heist . This strong slate means free cash flow will be negative in Q4, but management still expects free cash flow to turn positive in 2022 and beyond. The improvement in finances means that Netflix will now have more wiggle room to make acquisitions, such as the recently announced deal to buy the Roald Dahl Story Company . Netflix also plans to return excess cash going forward to shareholders in the form of share repurchases , where it just bought $100 million worth of shares in the third quarter. Netflix is turning a corner, stocking its content library while positioning the business on a solid financial footing. The stock price has recently surged toward new highs after being stuck in a trading range over the past year. With Netflix's ability to keep turning out surprise hits that create a stir on social media, on top of its improving cash-generating ability, I decided to buy shares now because I only see this streaming stock reaching higher highs over the next 10 years and beyond.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 12: Gary Payton II #0 of the Golden State Warriors knocks the ball from ... [+] LeBron James #6 of the Los Angeles Lakers during the first half of a preseason basketball game at Staples Center on October 12, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Getty Images It’s no secret that the Golden State Warriors are shelling out enormous amounts of money this year as they hit the NBA’s repeater tax for the first time, with essentially four maximum contracts on the books. Per Sportrac they’ll be paying an NBA record $346.2m in salaries and luxury tax savings this season. Luxury tax savings vs a 15th man For that reason there was a real question mark over whether the Warriors would use their 15th roster spot. As they were already in the $35m-$40m bracket over the luxury tax threshold, each dollar is multiplied by 6.25. A minimum salary of $1,669,178 costs them over $10.4m in tax, and over $12.1m once the salary is included. At the end of preseason they waived all the players competing for that 15th spot, including Avery Bradley which was a bold move for a team in desperate need of some backcourt defense and veteran savvy. But that wasn’t the end of the story. Gary Payton II had been previously signed to a partially guaranteed contract at the end of last season. By waiving him and then re-signing him to a new veteran minimum contract the Warriors ended up with their 15th man, and a smaller saving of $1.7m in luxury tax, thanks to the difference between Payton’s contract signed last season and the portion of the veteran minimum that actually counts against the salary cap. Payton is worth the cost Still, $10.4m in tax, and $12.1m overall, is a hefty price to pay for the 15th man on the roster. But last night, in Sacramento, Payton proved why he was worth the cost to the Warriors. With Iguodala resting, the Warriors needed a defensive guard to battle Sacramento’s impressive young backcourt. Payton II answered the challenge, proving “thousand per cent” that the Warriors were right to spend that extra cash according to Stephen Curry. MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers There’s never been any question about the defense with Payton, and that was on full display. The question mark over Payton has always been, what can he give you on offense? Interestingly, the Warriors have used Payton more like a slashing wing than a guard, which makes use of his athleticism and timing off the ball. They can get away with that thanks to their inverted offense with playmaking forwards like Draymond Green, Otto Porter Jr, and Nemanja Bjelica. But the three-point shooting is what will make or break Payton’s career. It’s hard to survive in the NBA with a career average of 26.7% from beyond the arc, especially as a perimeter player. The Warriors version of Payton though seems to have made somewhat of a breakthrough. Against the Kings Payton had 10 points in 17 minutes, including two big three point shots in the fourth quarter. That follows on from 10 games with the Golden State last season where Payton shot 50% from beyond the arc, and an impressive Summer League performance. The Warriors have a track record of developing fringe players Payton isn’t the first player who has come through the Warriors system and radically improved their shooting. Juan Toscano-Anderson was in much the same position in the 2019-20 season as an older player on the fringes of the NBA who was a defensive savant but held back by offensive limitations. Last season Toscano-Anderson really broke through, and that was partly down to his shooting 40% from deep. This season, he’s at 50%, albeit on a very small sample size. Damion Lee is another example of a player on the fringes of the NBA who the Warriors developed over a number of years. Although he was always a solid shooter, Lee improved to the point where he averaged a shade under 40% last season and is now a reliable part of the Warriors rotation. What Payton, Lee and Toscano-Anderson all have in common is that they are smart, savvy players who have had to work on their games to fix flaws. Because of their experience, intelligence, and versatility, they’re able to contribute as rotation pieces in the Warriors’ complex system. And most importantly for the Warriors, they have been able to secure all three on veteran minimum contracts to complement their enormously expensive roster. The Warriors won’t get any cheaper With Curry’s mega-extension the Warriors’ bills are unlikely to get any cheaper in the future. That’s why their younger players on rookie contracts are so important. Jordan Poole’s emergence this season is a great example of their hoped-for merging of timelines. He was borderline unplayable in his rookie season, before becoming a solid contributor in his second season. Now in his third year he’s primed for a leap. Salary cap-wise that gives the Warriors two years of production well above his value. By the time his contract comes up for extension, Wiggins’ deal will have expired. If they can pull off the same trick with Wiseman or Kuminga this season, and they could certainly use 15-20 minutes of someone who can put pressure on the rim, then they can continue the process and not have to worry about paying them big money until Draymond Green and Klay Thompson are off the books. That’s the key to longevity for the Warriors. But Poole also shows the risk. There’s no guarantee of anything when taking young, unpolished prospects. And Poole’s play, while vastly improved, still includes a little too much of the recklessness of youth. The shot selection can get a little wild, and the turnovers are a little too frequent. That’s what happens when you take younger prospects who need to develop. Long-term they might take you to a higher place, but the floor is a little lower. At the other end of the spectrum, free agency offers the opportunity for some value signings . But, even if the Warriors have done well there, there are more spots available on contenders than there are veterans in the limited pool who are willing to play for the minimum and can contribute to a playoff team. That leaves the Warriors needing some players in between their two timelines, who are a little more experienced and savvier, but don’t come with a big price-tag attached. Guys who don’t make too many mistakes, can play solid defense, knock down open shots, move the ball, and always be ready. And Payton II’s emergence may just be the latest prime example of that.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Action scenes offered Han So-hee a new way to express herself. Netflix It has only been four years since actress Han So-hee made her debut with a supporting role in the SBS drama Reunited Worlds , but since then she’s had leading roles in two Netflix NFLX dramas and made the Forbes Power Celebrity List for 2021. The actress earned national attention playing a woman involved in an affair with a married man in the 2020 drama World of The Married, a Korean remake of the BBC drama Dr. Foster . Then she played a vulnerable art student in the Netflix romantic drama Nevertheless . This year, the actress plays a woman out for revenge in My Name , a fast-paced, hard-hitting drama that quickly rose in the ranks of most-watched Netflix shows. In My Name she plays Ji-woo, a tough girl, whose life is dramatically changed when her father is murdered. Driven to revenge, Ji-woo joins the gang of a crime boss who knew her father. She wants to learn how to fight to kill and then goes undercover as a police officer to find the killer. The cast did most of their own action stunts, which included many brutal fight scenes. To play a gang member who could move as if she was capable of incapacitating professional killers, Han trained for months at an action school, building up muscle and gaining over 20 pounds. While Han initially found the action scenes challenging, the execution of such scenes provided a sense of accomplishment. “I realized that action can only be achieved by working with many people and going through situations step by step, not by myself, and I also felt a sense of pleasure and accomplishment in the process,” said Han. Han attended action school for months to prepare for her role. Netflix MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge For Han, action scenes provided a new outlet for expression. “In the genre of action, there are many parts where I can express emotions with my body,” said Han. “So I think there was a much wider range of ways to show the character’s emotions in a different way than with just facial expressions and eyes.” Han was intrigued by the character’s desire for revenge, but what drew her to the role was the character’s desperation. “It was for her father, but I think revenge is a great driving force in Ji-woo’s life, helping her to survive in a lonely world,” said Han. “I thought a lot about life after her revenge, that if the revenge, which she had to do even if she had to give up her name and future, was over. However, considering that Ji-woo’s life after that is not well drawn, I think revenge is probably everything to Ji-woo.” Han enjoys the challenge of seeing the world through the eyes of different characters, and trying on different personalities, but what motivates her to do her best as an actress is the Korean phrase, “hak mu ji gyeong.” “It’s a four-character idiom that means that there is no end in learning,” she said. “Literally, as there is no end to all learning, the eternal curiosity about the vast world of acting and my desire to do well. I think these two are the driving forces that make me move.” The actress and popular model did feel some pressure after her sudden rise to fame with World of the Married , but she found that the resulting tension improved her focus and it helped her do her best. “I’m just so grateful that you know that I exist,” she said. “I will try to be a better actor so that I can return the love and interest that many people send me.”",

In addition, the OTC ruling includes guidelines for Personal Sound Amplification Devices (PSAP’s), which are non-medical and open to a broad interpretation with far-reaching commercial applications. Considered to be the third most common physical condition after arthritis and heart disease, untreated hearing loss has been linked to anxiety, depression, social isolation, reduced mobility, falls, dementia, and lower quality of life and relationships. It is also an issue facing more than elderly populations. Hearing loss also affects millions of people under the age of 35, as well as kids who go untested and consequently struggle with learning. The Real Game-Changer The real game-changer, however, will be at the intersection of wellness, fitness, and consumer audio products. The regulatory shift, when combined with exponential advancements in sound and wellness tech, helps fuel the Hearables Revolution and what is estimated to become a 93 billion dollar Hearables (in-ear audio devices) market by 2026. The long-term impact will be on the Amplified Future : the full integration of audio as a key component of personalized and precision medicine. Amplified Future Canva MORE FOR YOU Germany’s Renk Group Seeks To Revitalize An Iconic American Defense Manufacturer What Drives Newly Minted CRISPR Unicorn Mammoth Biosciences A Million Parts Using 3D Printing? Mantle’s Printed Tooling Powers Mass Production Sound Health: Hearing Aids vs Hearables Until now, the hearing aid industry has set the medical standards shaping consumer concerns around hearing loss. Hearing aids also represents a growing high-ticket reimbursable market that’s worth $1.6B in the US, and slightly more in China. The Big 5 hearing aid companies, however, only serve 14% of people suffering from hearing loss in the US. They have done little to address the social stigma, help younger and uninsured populations, or keep costs down. That leaves the majority of the population unserved: those dealing with mild to moderate hearing loss who don’t require medical-grade hearing aids or implants. Hearables Projected Market Circuit Digest Both OTC Hearing Aids and Hearables have an opportunity to fill a large part of that market gap while providing products that deliver infinitely more features than traditional hearing aids at a fraction of the cost. Smart-audio and wearable product manufacturers are already lining up to serve that population, expand their brand footprint, and get their slice of the Hearables pie. Merging Audio and Wellness Expertise In 1964, engineer and MIT professor Amar Bose founded his audio brand so he could dramatically improve the fidelity and transform the listener experience for recorded music. (He personally loved listening to classical music). Over 50 years later, the company in been making moves into both medical hearing aids and wellness-based consumer Hearables. They have already introduced their first FDA-cleared direct-to-consumer self-fitting hearing aid for less than 1/3 of the price of traditional hearing aids and are continuing development of their in-ear sleep aide technology, SleepBuds. Bose Earbuds Bose The new FDA ruling gives Bose an opportunity to create more solid revenue streams for their new healthcare division as they seek to establish themselves as a credible and trusted wellness brand. According to Steve Romine, VP of Bose Hear, “We’re thrilled the FDA has announced the issuing of its draft OTC hearing aid regulations. This marks a great moment for the millions of Americans experiencing hearing loss today...For now, there’s renewed optimism for hearing loss sufferers who have put their hearing health on the back-burner due to the numerous barriers to getting the help they need to hearing better again.” In another marriage of consumer audio tech and hearing health, Sennheiser sold its consumer product division to Swiss hearing aid company Sonova last year for $240 million. In addition to giving Sennheiser immediate credibility and positioning in healthcare, the move will allow Sonova to bridge into non-medical consumer audio products. Apple’s Slow But Steady Advances Into the Future of Health The most valuable tech company in the world (currently valued at over $2 trillion) — Apple — is steadily building out its ecosystem and product lines for in-ear audio, fitness, and health. Apple recently announced their “conversation boost” feature for more precise listening through their AirPods, and the company is exploring other hearing enhancement features that will go beyond the benefits of noise reduction and — their latest announcement — spatial audio. There is also talk in the air about temperature and posture monitoring with their new AirPods Pro, as well as using iPhones to help diagnose depression and cognitive decline. Apple has already staked a majority claimed for what will become the most coveted and connected real estate on the human body - the human ear. Last year, AirPods enabled Apple to capture over one-third of the high-end consumer earbud market. Various sources are saying that if Apple spun off their AirPods division into to a separate company, 2020 revenues for the spinoff would have surpassed those of Uber, Adobe, Nvidia, and Spotify. Apple Airpods is a game changer Digital Information World Apple continues to add value to their AppleFit programs with health and wellness monitoring features via their primary wearable, the Apple Watch, in sync with iCloud the the iPhone. In 2020, however, AirPods unit sales had more than doubled those of the Watch, giving another clear indicator of the continued migration from wearables to hearables. While I doubt Apple will move fully into the OTC hearing aid market, as suggested by the recent The Wall Street Journal article , the fashionable tech giant is well-positioned in both the consumer marketplace and the human ear to make a big play in the Amplified Future, focusing on the most scalable health, audio, and wellness features. New Players In The Game Companies like CES 2020 Honoree & Consumer Technology Association (CTA) Innovation Award winner Nuheara, started developing their Hearable devices - IQbuds - after a successful 2016 Indiegogo campaign and 2017 CES launch. Nuheara TIME Earlier this month, Nuheara announced that it has commenced its clinical trial with the National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL), to support its planned expansion into clinically tested and regulatory-approved hearing aids. Japanese manufacturer Olive Union has been targeting the younger populations and that 86% of the 48 million Americans who suffer from mild to moderate hearing loss and don’t require medical-grade hearing aids. In the process of trying to de-stigmatize hearing aids, however, they are coming up with some very stylish hearable offerings, like their Olive Pros and SmartEar Plus that combine hi-end personalized audio features to provide style (they have a similar form to AirPods), hi-fidelity music listening (via the ability to choose between Music Mode and Hearing Mode), noise reduction, and customizable hearing enhancement features via their phone app. Olive Pro hearing aids Olive Union Olive Union closed a $7 million B round in April 2021 , bringing their total funding raised to date $20 million for their next-generation smart hearing technology. Kokoon sleep phones have integrated EEG sensors and other sleep-specific features to capitalize on the burgeoning sleep market. Although they offer a more traditional headphone (over-the-ear) design, their software interface provides more content options than Bose in-ear SleepBuds including streaming third-party music sources via Bluetooth from your mobile device. Because the global epidemic of sleep problems and the consumer demand for better non-pharmaceutical solutions are not going away anytime soon, you can expect a new wave of innovations in hearables for sleep in the near future. Why Consumer Audio Companies are Racing Into Health & Wellness Why are investment funds, new ventures, and audio heavyweights jumping headfirst into the health tech pool? The global market for earbuds and headphones is growing steadily as wireless becomes the norm and new features continue to improve performance and usefulness. A report from Grand View Research , set the value at $25 billion in 2019 (before witnessing the record-breaking 2020 AirPods sales), with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20% from 2020 to 2027. The total wearables market was worth nearly $70bn in 2019, with the hearables sector (including headphones), making up $28bn of that. Amazon, Apple Or Spotify: The Musical Race To Dominate Digital Wellness Forbes Even digital music and content companies are looking at wellness as a way to differentiate , create new revenue streams, and attract customers away from their competitors. The evolution of higher fidelity and feature-rich hearables will only help their cause. The audio products market, however, is crowded and highly competitive. That means market caps and lower profit margins for traditional and limited-use audio products. For consumer audio product manufacturers to compete and create exponential growth in the future, they may have to cut their slice from a bigger pie. According to a report from Precedence Research , the broader Digital Health Market was $181 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to over $550 billion by 2027. It is predicted that the much broader and exponentially larger global healthcare market will reach $ 10 trillion by 2022 . The largest US healthcare company, McKesson MCK , already has an annual revenue of over $208 billion. While these numbers are inclusive of a number of sectors that make up the massive global health and wellness markets, those are some pretty attractive figures for forward-thinking digital audio product manufacturers to consider. Why Voice Will Lead Biometrics in Hearables CANVA Even without including digital health and personalized medicine, 2020 w ellness expenditures ($4.2 trillion, per the Global Wellness Institute) surpassed over half of total global health expenditures ($7.3 trillion, based on WHO data). That wellness industry represents 5.3 percent of global economic output. When it comes to the ever-increasing number of startups entering the digital health and wellness space, there seems to be no sign of slowing, especially if you measure future growth by current investments. Global VC funding for Q1 of this year marked a record-setting quarter for investments into Digital Health companies, hitting $7.2 billion - twice that invested during the same quarter in 2020. As of the close of Q3 2021 — according to CB Insights’ State of Healthcare market report — digital health startups have raised $39.6B in funding YTD, already 27% more than 2020 funding totals. Q3 also saw the birth of ten new healthcare unicorns, bringing the industry’s total to 91 - the 3rd highest ever. As audio becomes an increasingly more important health and wellness pipeline for data tracking and content delivery, and wearables continue their migration to high-feature multi-purpose hearables, the overlap of these markets will merge to create a bigger pie. Apple Earpod Customer Getty Images Listen Up: Voice Bring More Value to the Future of Hearables And let’s not forget the exploding Voice Economy which has already established household names by the likes of Alexa, Siri, and Google GOOG Assistant. The possibilities at the i ntersection of voice analytics and personalized health monitoring continue to expand . Anyone who uses their earbuds to make phone calls or voice commands, can likely envision how the human ear will become the #1 place to seamlessly capture biometric health and wellness data from your voice. Beyond the FDA and Into the Future There is no doubt that the FDA guidelines released last week will play an important role. One way to look at the FDA ruling is through the disruptive lens of the hearing aid market, but that only provides a narrow view of a complex matrix of forces that are creating, transforming, and connecting a number of much larger markets. We are entering the A mplified Future —one that will feature ongoing real-time and multivariable predictive analysis by sensor-rich hearables and wearables. In addition to improving how we hear the world, these devices will monitor our vitals on the go and offer real-time recommendations for enhancing our physical and emotional well-being. These same technologies will provide early detection data to help us avoid life-threatening diseases, all as we go about our daily routines, all captured seamlessly through closed-loop systems between our ears, the cloud, our phones and other smart devices. The companies that build the best UX and ecosystem to successfully bridge more traditional uses of this 2-way audio highway (voice and music), with highly effective, personalized, and convenient health and wellness features will have the best arsenal to win in the Hearables Revolution. Along with the competition, they will also help democratize and de-stigmatize hearing enhancement solutions for the new majority.",

    "full_description": "Unity Software ( NYSE:U ) is known for its software that makes it easy to make mobile games. It also helps developers effectively monetize their mobile apps. However that's not all it can be used for. In this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass , recorded on Oct. 11 , Fool contributor Jose Najarro talks about the other industries that can use Unity, including robotics, automotive, and animation. Moreover, Jose shares an impressive stat that could propel Unity to become the default software choice for developers for years to come. Jose Najarro: Let me take a quick look at why I'm excited about Unity. Unity, like I mentioned right now, it's mainly known for the games, this is where most of the revenue is coming in, but their optionality of expanding into other markets is where I believe the strong growth can come from Unity. One of my favorite things this year, they're focusing in what they called \"accelerating solutions.\" For example, if you want to do some form of training, here they do some form of medical training, you can create some form of virtual world within Unity and help these training in the medical field. Another thing that I think is super impressive is the simulation and robotics. If you are in the simulation and the robotics market, for, let's say, an autonomous robot, you need to have numerous and numerous data points. I don't know if you guys can see this walking robot back here. For this robot to really learn to walk, it has to keep practicing over and over again until it finally learns the proper way to do it, and that takes time. If you want to get a lot of data points, you need to have 100, maybe 200 real robots each trying new steps, each collecting new data points, but with Unity, you can create the simulation of having a million robots, each of these million robots create a new step and now you're collecting a lot cheaper data points. I believe this is a market that is still in early stages right now, Unity is mainly known for gaming, but the simulation and the robotics I believe is where one of the future growth is going to come from. Here is another one, human machine interface. Here, you can see a person is using some form of heavy machinery. Here you can see a screen of, hey, maybe it's overheating, maybe you have plenty of gas. This human machine interface, I believe is becoming a lot more used in the automobile industry. We have those dashboards which are more digital. We have, I believe we're working with the front mirror, which now you can see things in the front mirror opposed to the dashboard, so there's human machine interface. Again, these are optionalities where Unity can continue to get into. Another one is the automotive transportation and manufacturing. Let's say you are a car company and you want to show off your car, but you don't have that car in the lot, maybe you can have some of your engineer's design this virtual 3D car. Now if a customer comes into your store, you're able to put on this VR glasses, let's take a virtual dive into this car and you can see it pretty much like you're seeing it in real life. Numerous other solutions in the animation, in the cinematics. There's this animation studio that was making an episode every week because Unity was reducing their costs and reducing their time by about 40%. The architecture, engineering, and construction, let's say you're some architecture, you wanted to sign some real life images of the product or the project you're working in, you can use Unity for those solutions. So optionality, plenty. We can also see the augmented reality and virtual reality are pretty big. I do believe the CEO mentioned it. I believe he mentioned two-thirds of augmented reality and virtual reality applications are made through Unity right now. This optionality that Unity creates is amazing. Then I wanted to show, how popular is Unity and how popular are some of the other game engines. This is Udemy.com. This is a place if you want to learn new skills. I ended up going to Udemy and purchased game development. I wanted to see what were some of the big players out in the game development. We can see right now, most popular people learning is this one right here. This is a Unity game developing class. No. 2 is Unreal Engine. This is true. Its second competitor. No. 3 is another Unity class. No. 4 is another Unity class, and No. 5 is another Unity class. Within the top five most popular game developer engines, the top five most popular courses, four are based on Unity, one is based on Unreal Engine. I think this is a great way to see, hey, where are game developers focusing on? Because if game developers are focusing on learning about Unity, that means that the gaming studios out there are focusing on game developers that know how to use Unity. It's kind of that cycle, the more game developers you have, the more careers you have, the more careers within Unity is going to drive more people to study Unity, and then the circle just continues and most gaming studios will move into the Unity platform.",

Image source: Getty Images. Facebook starts things off Facebook will report earnings on Monday afternoon after the closing bell. The company has been going through some challenges of late, with allegations from a whistleblower adding to long-standing controversies surrounding the social media giant. That has weighed on shares, but the earnings report will give investors a chance to return to fundamentals. In particular, Facebook will need to demonstrate that it can keep growing user engagement along with maintaining its impressive monetization metrics. In addition, keeping costs in line will be essential to sustain profit growth. Success in these areas won't stop regulators from attacking Facebook. However, it would reassure investors that the long-term picture for the company remains favorable. Microsoft, Alphabet weigh in On Tuesday, Microsoft and Alphabet will add their financial results to the mix. Microsoft investors expect the company's Office suite of business productivity software should continue to perform strongly, complementing its Azure cloud computing service. In addition, strength in the Xbox video game segment could also be a key contributor to overall performance for the software giant. Meanwhile, Alphabet has garnered a reputation for being a value stock in the tech sector. The company behind the Google search engine should continue to see advertising activity pick up after a tough period a year ago, and investors are also pleased to see rising activity levels in the Google Cloud segment despite its lagging well behind Microsoft's Azure and the Amazon Web Services platform. Apple, Amazon finish things off Finally, Apple and Amazon will report their earnings results on Thursday afternoon. The two companies together cover a huge swath of the consumer economy, yet many investors will look beyond their most obvious businesses to see how other growth drivers are performing. For Apple, expectations are high . The release of the iPhone 13 won't necessarily show up in this quarter's results, given that the company only started shipping the newest smartphone line in the last week of the period. Nevertheless, comments from the company could reveal what sort of reception the hot product is getting from consumers, along with other recently released products. By contrast, with shortages of key components across the tech sector, any negative comments about supply chain issues could weigh on the entire market. Meanwhile, Amazon investors are also hoping to see how the company fares without founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO role. Some expect a potential pullback in business activity, given the big boost that the e-commerce segment got in the year-earlier period from waves of COVID-19 cases. Yet others believe that Amazon might be understating how well it's likely to fare, especially given the rising importance of Amazon Web Services to its overall success. These five stocks are huge and together could have a big impact not just on the Nasdaq but on the entire market. Stay tuned throughout the week to see how the five tech giants fare, and you'll have a better idea of the market's likely direction as well as the long-term promise of these massively successful businesses.",

    "full_description": "I've been picking stocks to avoid every week, singling out names with a lot to prove in the coming days. My three stocks to avoid last week were on the move -- up 6%, down 1%, and down 4% -- averaging out to a 0.3% increase. The S&P 500 rose 1.6% for the week, so I was the relative winner on my bearish calls. This week I see Digital World Acquisition Corp. ( NASDAQ:DWAC ) , Pinterest ( NYSE:PINS ) , and PetMed Express ( NASDAQ:PETS ) as vulnerable investments in the near term. Here's why I think these are three stocks to avoid this week. Image source: Getty Images. Digital World Acquisition One of last week's biggest winners was Digital World Acquisition. The SPAC -- or special purpose acquisition company -- closed below last month's IPO price of $10 a share on Wednesday afternoon. It exploded higher in the final two trading days after announcing that it would be joining forces with Donald Trump's new media company venture. Trump Media & Technology Group said it plans to launch a new social networking platform called Truth Social in the coming months. Singling out Digital World Acquisition as a stock to avoid isn't political commentary. We don't do that here. If anything, polarizing media empires sometimes carve out thin but dedicated and passionate followers. The problem is that the stock more than quadrupled on Thursday, only to double on Friday. The stock soared a scintillating 846% in just a pair of trading days. What happens next? We've seen a lot of SPAC deals pop on hot combinations, only to give back most of those gains. Reality often fails to live up to the hype, and sometimes folks hopping on the headlines don't realize the dilution and financial breakdown of SPAC combinations. Pinterest Another proposed pairing that made waves last week -- but this one without confirmation -- was a report that PayPal ( NASDAQ:PYPL ) was negotiating to buy Pinterest in a mostly stock deal that would value the visual search engine at $70 a share. PayPal investors hated the chatter , sending the stock nearly 12% lower on the news in the three subsequent trading days. If PayPal had made an all-stock offer for $70 on Tuesday -- and, again, there's nothing official from either side -- it would be worth less than $62 right now. Aside from the potential buyout offer that the market doesn't seem to like, Pinterest reports quarterly results on Tuesday. It disappointed investors by posting a sequential decline in total active users last time out. It also clocked in with both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year slides in domestic active accounts. Revenue is growing briskly on the strength of improving monetization, but if usage keeps sliding, it will be hard to get retail investors or a larger suitor to get excited in Pinterest. PetMed Express It's easy for growth and income investors to fall into the PetMed Express trap. The mail-order provider of pet medications seemingly offers a reasonable play on the dog and cat adoptions that exploded last year when the pandemic began. PetMed Express also offers a generous dividend of 4.4%. It may seem like the perfect combo until you realize how poorly the business itself is faring these days. PetMed Express has fallen short of Wall Street profit targets in back-to-back quarters, and that's an unfortunate trend that could eat into payout growth. Analysts also see revenue declining 5% this fiscal year. This isn't a growth stock. You have to go back to fiscal 2009 to find the last time PetMed Express posted double-digit growth. Even now, when the humanization of pets trend finds more of us treating our furry friends like members of the family, we're not turning to PetMed Express to keep our beloved canines and felines medicated. It reports financial results for its fiscal second quarter after Monday's close. It's hard to get excited after recent misses and a lack of growth. If you're looking for safe stocks , you aren't likely to find them in Digital World Acquisition, Pinterest, and PetMed Express this week.",

While most of the artifacts and exhibits in the museum are focused on English soccer, a quarter of the museum’s visitors are from overseas. The museum’s press & media coordinator Dickie Felton says that pre-Covid, the museum saw around 50,000 overseas visitors a year, the majority coming from Europe. Unsurprisingly, the museum gets more visitors on days that Manchester United or Manchester City are at home.

(Photo by Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images) Corbis via Getty Images London is the capital of UK tourism, and its huge visitor numbers mean it also gets the most visitors to watch soccer, with a survey of international passengers in 2019 by VisitBritain suggesting it gets almost half a million visits that include watching a game live.

But a much higher proportion of visitors to the North West of England go there specifically for the beautiful game . 18% of visitors to the North West in 2019 went there to watch soccer, compared to just 3% of visitors to London. The two stadiums that welcomed the most overseas fans were the home grounds of Manchester United and Liverpool. VisitBritain estimates that 1.5 million visits to the UK in 2019 included watching a live soccer match, up from around 900,000 in 2011. Of the visits in 2019, there were an estimated 226,000 trips to Old Trafford and 213,000 trips to Anfield. But most soccer trips from overseas involved only a few stadiums, with the top eight stadiums making up around 80% of all soccer stadium visits in England by overseas. It’s not just stadiums though that attract overseas soccer fans. VisitBritain’s market insight survey found that many fans, especially those from the U.S. and Scandinavia, also enjoyed watching the game in a local pub, while Brazilians were particularly interested in stadium tours.

(Photo by Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images) Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images Tottenham Hotspur, whose new stadium had more visits from overseas fans than Chelsea or Manchester City in 2019, are one of the clubs to capitalize on the increase in sport tourism, adding new features this year to the skywalk on their stadium’s roof. They also have plans to add a cinema and go-karting to the stadium to attract even more visitors. Overseas visitors who watched a soccer match spent $1.9 billion during their trips to the UK in 2019, bringing a boost to the economies of the cities that attract overseas fans. But many local fans who attend games might be worried about how “soccer tourists” affect the atmosphere inside stadiums. Clubs that go out of their way to attract overseas fans need to not lose sight of why these fans visit in the first place. VisitBritain found that 70% of Americans and 71% of Indians who had traveled to watch a match said atmosphere was a key reason for their trip. If clubs want to benefit from soccer tourism, they must be careful not to overdo it at the expense of local fans, or they risk killing the goose that lays soccer tourism’s golden eggs. With travel restrictions starting to get lifted, it won’t be long before more people start traveling to England to watch Premier League games again, and while they’re there, they might stop by the local pub, get vertigo on Tottenham Hotspur’s stadium roof, and learn about why you shouldn’t wear a cream-colored Armani suit at Wembley.",

Despite the stock's post-earnings tumble, there were a number of positives to come out of the report, showing that the pullback may be just a blip. Image source: Getty Images. 1. User growth is strong Of all the major publicly traded social media platforms (Snapchat, Twitter , Facebook , and Pinterest ), none is growing as fast as Snapchat. Daily active users in the third quarter exceeded the company's own guidance, increasing by 23% to 306 million, which marked its fourth consecutive quarter of at least 20% year-over-year user growth. Snap is also experiencing user growth in all three of its geographies: North America, Europe, and Rest of World. That's important because it shows Snapchat continuing to resonate with its audience and drive increased adoption. The business' growth is ultimately tied to its user base, and the more users it has to monetize, the greater its potential revenue is. The company is also winning with the most valuable demographic -- users aged 13 to 34 in developed countries. In its core markets in the U.S., U.K., France, Australia, and Netherlands, 90% of the 13-to-24 population and 75% of the 13-to-34 population uses Snapchat. Piper Sandler 's survey of American teens found that Snapchat was the most popular social media platform with a 35% share this fall, up from 31% in the spring. For the fourth quarter, the company expects robust user growth to continue, forecasting DAUs of 316 million to 318 million, or up 19% to 20% from the year-ago quarter. As long as user growth is solid, the growth story is intact. 2. Profitability is ramping quickly For a long time, Snap looked like a money pit, burning cash to fund its operations, but that's changing as the business scales. Now, it's starting to enjoy some of the same unit economics that have made digital advertising platforms like Facebook so profitable. In the third quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) of $174.2 million, more than tripling from the year-ago quarter and representing a margin of 16.3%. Free cash flow turned positive at $52 million, compared to a loss of $70 million in Q3 2020. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a per-share profit of $0.17, up from just $0.01 in the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company is still losing money as it spends aggressively on share-based compensation, with $300 million in that category in the third quarter, but GAAP profitability should soon follow the other key metrics. Snap's gross margin is also improving in line with its goals. It noted on the earnings call that gross margin reached 60% in Q3, up from 58% in Q3 2020 and from 56% in the second quarter. That should give investors more confidence that profitability will continue to scale as the company grows. Considering the margins of larger peers like Facebook and Alphabet 's Google, the profit ceiling for Snap is a high one. 3. New products are resonating Snap's focus on innovation also distinguishes itself from other social media platforms . Rather than functioning as a forum for posting, Snap's builds unique and creative tools for users to connect directly with each other. It invented Stories, which was copied by nearly every other social media platform, and has added unique features like Snap Map, which shows users where their friends are and what they're doing (with permission), and Spotlight, which highlights the most popular Snaps of the day, making Snapchat both a source of entertainment and a way of connecting with friends. Submissions to Spotlight more than doubled from Q2, showing the feature is reaching a wide audience. The company has also invested in augmented reality tools and continues to see strong engagement with them. More than 200 million people engaged with AR every day on Snapchat, and the company used AR tools for unique applications like teaching users sign language and allowing them to experience the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude's rendering of the Arc de Triomphe. Ignore the distractions Issues like the supply chain disruptions and even Apple's advertising changes are short-term challenges. The uncertainty around those events explains why the company's guidance was so weak, but investors are better off ignoring those factors as they are not meaningful to the long-term trajectory of the business. Snap is executing in the areas it can control, driving user growth, improving profit margins, and innovating with new products. The business remains healthy. The stock, however, was priced dearly coming into the report, so a sell-off makes sense. Still, long-term investors may want to seize this moment as a buying opportunity as these headwinds will ultimately be fleeting.",

    "full_description": "Since the start of 2021, Peloton ( NASDAQ:PTON ) has been pedaling backward. The connected fitness company's stock is down almost 40% year to date with many shareholders likely questioning everything that made them love the business in the first place. But what's really behind that slide? A whole host of issues that potential investors need to consider. Image source: Peloton. A series of unfortunate events When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, this already thriving business experienced a serious surge in demand as gyms closed and group sports went on hiatus. People who wanted to work out needed to find ways to do that at home, and many of them turned to Peloton's fitness equipment. On the back of this booming demand, the stock rose an incredible 434% in 2020, a period when triple-digit quarterly revenue and subscriber growth was not uncommon for the company. However, Peloton's popularity led to demand outstripping production capacity with long delivery delays (and dissatisfied customers) starting last fall. Delivery times have since returned back to pre-pandemic levels, but the company is still grappling with other problems , and the business has been trending negatively since early 2021 . Making the biggest headlines this year were safety issues . Peloton initially took a defensive posture in response to warnings the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued regarding its Tread and Tread+ products back in April. But it eventually gave in with a complete recall of both products, and management promised software and hardware updates to address the risks the equipment posed. This was obviously not a good look for Peloton, and questions were raised as to why management hadn't immediately addressed regulators and consumers' safety concerns. However, the Tread was back on the market by late August. When the company reported its fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter results on Aug. 26, investors were disappointed . One point that stuck out in the shareholder letter was the announcement of a material weakness in internal controls related to the process Peloton uses to value its inventory. While management asserted it was only a minor problem, it's never good news when a company's financial-reporting processes are called into question. And as if investors needed more surprises, management also decided to lower the price of the flagship Peloton Bike by $400 to $1,495. Although the stated goal of this strategy -- to widen Peloton's potential customer base and addressable market -- is laudable, the timing is suspect. Revenue growth saw a major deceleration in the fiscal fourth quarter, and what's more, guidance for the current period calls for $800 million in revenue (another quarter-on-quarter slowdown) and increased member churn of 0.85%, which added to the market's negativity around the stock. T he share price has fallen 18% since the fiscal fourth-quarter release. Then, there's competition All of these developments have occurred as competition in the fitness industry is heating up. Brick-and-mortar gyms are back, as evidenced by Planet Fitness ' strong showing in the second quarter. The low-cost gym operator has grown its membership count for seven straight months. Then, there are other high-end fitness equipment brands like Hydrow, Tonal, and Lululemon 's Mirror. Even Nautilus provides a full range of competitively priced products for consumers. It definitely hasn't been a pedal in the park for Peloton during its short time as a publicly-traded company , but current conditions offer management a valuable chance to adjust course and, hopefully, create a stronger and more resilient business in the long run. How should investors proceed? One thing that remains strikingly clear about Peloton is its stationary bikes are loved by those who own them. Even its $12.99 a month digital-only memberships are praised by people I know who have them. The ability to offer a superior product is a winning characteristic for any business, but it's even more vital during tumultuous periods like the one the company is currently experiencing. For investors considering opening a position in the stock following its decline, the best course of action is to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Peloton will report financial results for its fiscal 2022 first quarter (which ended Sept. 30) in early November. That's when we're likely to get some more clarity around how the Tread+ is faring in the marketplace, as well as what the demand trends look like for the company's lower-priced Bike. If those quarterly results are largely positive, it could signal a buying opportunity for a consumer-discretionary stock that has struggled in 2021.",

Locsin recalled the 75th anniversary of the UN in 2020, which was marked “in a somber mood” because of COVID-19, and said that “though we are still not out of the woods, we now have the knowledge and tools to fight it: vaccines, medicines, and informed policies.” In particular, Locsin acknowledged the COVAX facility, “without which, the Philippines’ COVID vaccination program would still be languishing.” In addition to the COVAX vaccines, Gonzalez reported that through some 150 different initiatives of the UN Country Team in the Philippines, by the end of 2020, more than 5 million at risk individuals were able to access essential health services, and more than 6 million boys and girls were supported with distance learning. Equally, Locsin lauded the “milestone initiative of the Philippines-United Nations Joint Programme on collaboration in human rights between the UN and a government.” “I thank UN Resident Coordinator and my good friend Gustavo Gonzalez. Under his leadership the UN Country Team has become our most reliable partner in sustainable development, in fighting climate change and upholding human rights. He embodies the “inclusive multilateralism” declared by President Duterte as the only multilateralism that “can deliver the global public goods we need.” On 22 July 2021, the Philippines and the UN signed the UN Joint Programme on Human Rights. The three-year UN joint programme was developed to implement Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution 45/33, adopted on 7 October 2020, which outlined specific areas for capacity-building and technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines. The joint programme document was signed by Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Menardo Guevarra, Locsin and Gonzalez, with the late Jose Luis Gascon of the Commission on Human Rights in attendance. Aside from the DoJ, the UN joint programme is being co-implemented by the Presidential Human Rights Committee Secretariat (PHRCS), the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), the Department of Health (DOH), the Anti-Terrorism Council-Program Management Center (ATC-PMC), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).

Looking ahead, Gonzalez said that the UN in the Philippines will support the Philippines to finance efforts to build forward better from COVID-19. “We have set one priority with the government for the coming year which is to help set up a diversified financing framework that will leverage additional resources for COVID-19 recovery and getting SDGs back on track.” “Ultimately the success of the United Nations team must be measured in the difference we make in people’s lives….

    "full_description": "Investors were left disappointed after WD-40 's ( NASDAQ:WDFC ) latest set of earnings. However, at the time of writing, the stock was down more than 19% in 2021, and the dip will surely attract value investors into a company with a highly visible household product. Is now the time to take advantage of the dip? Image source: Getty Images. WD-40 stock I'm going to cut to the chase. I think the answer is no -- it's not the time to buy the dip. There are three main reasons for this. Despite the benefit of the stay-at-home measures -- spending on DIY surged during the lockdowns -- management has been walking down expectations for its mid-term revenue targets. Hitting guidance will not be a walk in the park. Spending on advertising and promotions increased in the fourth quarter to drive revenue growth at the cost of earnings. I'll deal with these points in turn. Revenue targets On the company's second-quarter 2020 earnings presentation in April 2020, management made a subtle change to its long-term revenue growth aspirations. Instead of an \"anticipated revenue target\" of $700 million in the full year 2025, management shifted it to $700 million as a \"long-term target.\" Fast forward to the third-quarter 2021 earnings in July 2021, and it changed its revenue target to $650 million to $700 million in full-year 2025. While it's completely understandable that many companies, including WD-40, are facing challenges due to supply chain issues, it's also worth noting that the company is one of the beneficiaries of the pandemic due to the stay-at-home measures. Moreover, during the third-quarter earnings call, CEO Garry Ridge told investors, \" ... we do believe that the shift in consumer spending patterns associated with the pandemic will benefit us over the long term.\" If that's the case, then it's reasonable to expect WD-40 to be raising its long-term growth aspirations, not cutting them. Image source: Getty Images. Guidance In addition, there are question marks around the company's ability to hit its guidance. For example, in the recently reported fourth quarter, WD-40 reported a 3% increase in sales to $155.2 million, but on a constant currency basis, net sales were only $108.8 million compared to $111.6 million in the same quarter of last year. Part of the constant currency sales decline is due to supply chain disruptions. Still, management acknowledged that it's also coming up against tough comparisons with the \"isolation renovation\" sales boost caused by the pandemic. Given that those difficult year-over-year comparisons will extend into 2022, the company's guidance for net sales growth of 7% to 11% is open to question. Also, even if WD-40 hits its 2022 sales target, the midpoint of which is $532 million, it will still have to perform a lot better than it has in recent years to hit its 2025 target. For example, to hit $700 million in 2025 from $532 million in 2022 implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6%, and to hit $650 million means a CAGR of 6.9%. By way of comparison, here's the sales performance over the last five years. Note that the CAGR from 2019 to 2021 was 7.4%, and between 2017 and 2021 it was just 5.1%. So WD-40 will have to step up its growth to hit its 2025 target, and that's even with accepting its 2022 guidance for around $532 million in net sales. Metric 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Net sales $381 million $409 million $423 million $408 million $488 million Net sales growth 0% 7.5% 3.4% (3.5%) 19.6% Data source: WD-40 presentations. Author's analysis. Advertising and promotional spending WD-40 operates a so-called 55/30/25 business model, aiming for 55% gross margin, a cost of doing business of 30% of revenue (a lower number is better), and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) of 25%. As you can see below, the company didn't hit any of these targets in the fourth quarter or the full year. Furthermore, the cost of doing business and EBITDA figures were negatively impacted by a ramp up in spending on advertising and promotions (to 8.9% of sales). Although management said this was a one-off increase, it's still a case of ramping investment and walking down long-term guidance at the same time. Metric Target Fourth Quarter 2021 Full-Year 2021 Gross margin 55% 51% 54% Cost of doing business 30% 39% 35% EBITDA 25% 12% 20% Data source: WD-40 presentations. A stock to buy? Trading on more than 40 times its 2021 earnings and 39 times the midpoint of management's 2022 guidance, WD-40 remains a highly rated stock. What's more, it is not performing in line with a high-growth company rating. CEO Garry Ridge, who sold $11.9 million worth of stock in July, wants investors to take an \"infinite mindset.\" That's something they will have to do to justify buying a stock on this kind of valuation.",

    "full_description": "You'll often hear that Social Security should not be your only source of retirement income. That's because the average recipient today only collects $1,565 a month. And while that's not a negligible sum of money by any means, it's also probably not enough to live comfortably on. But while many people strive to bring personal savings into retirement, many ultimately fall short of meeting their goals. The good news, however, is that Social Security will reward you financially for holding off on claiming benefits. And it's for this reason that signing up at age 70 makes so much sense. Image source: Getty Images. Could you use a major boost to your benefits? You're entitled to your full monthly Social Security benefit based on your personal wage history once you reach full retirement age , or FRA. FRA is based on your year of birth, as follows: Year of Birth Full Retirement Age 1943-1954 66 1955 66 and 2 months 1956 66 and 4 months 1957 66 and 6 months 1958 66 and 8 months 1959 66 and 10 months 1960 or later 67 Data source: Social Security Administration. Now you don't have to sign up for benefits at FRA. You can claim them as early as age 62, albeit at a reduced rate. Or, you can delay your filing beyond FRA, and for each month you do, your benefits will increase by 2/3 of 1%. This means that on a yearly basis, you're looking at an 8% increase for delaying your Social Security filing. Once you reach the age of 70, you can no longer accrue the delayed retirement credits that result in an increase to your benefits. But if you manage to hold out until age 70, you'll snag the maximum Social Security benefit you can get based on your earnings history. So say you're entitled to a monthly benefit of $1,600 at an FRA of 67. If you hold off on filing until 70, that benefit will rise to $1,984 on a permanent basis. Here's why that's so important. Not only can a larger benefit compensate for any savings shortfall you might be grappling with, but the value of your nest egg can change based on how its investments perform. In poor market conditions, the value of your IRA or 401(k) plan might sink, at which point you may want to leave it alone and let it recover. But if you're not collecting enough income from Social Security to cover your bills, that won't be possible, and you'll need to lock in losses. As such, collecting a higher Social Security benefit won't just give you more spending power. It could also make it possible to avoid major losses in your retirement plan that hurt you throughout your senior years. What's the right choice for you? Claiming Social Security at age 70 may not be the right move for everyone. And it may not even be possible for you. If you lose your job in your mid-60s, for example, and can't get rehired, you may have to sign up for benefits to keep up with your living costs. But if you have the option to delay your filing until the age of 70, it could very much benefit you financially to take it.",

    "content": "Environmental protesters pressuring the British government to insulate all homes within a decade resumed a road-blocking campaign in London on Monday ahead of the United Nations’ annual climate conference. As commuters headed to work, demonstrators from the Insulate Britain campaign obstructed a major artery into Canary Wharf, a major financial center in east London that is home to some of the world’s biggest banks. Other roads into the British capital’s traditional financial center, the City of London, which is a few miles west of Canary Wharf, were also blocked. The Metropolitan Police force said 52 people were arrested in connection with Monday’s protests, during which some demonstrators glued themselves to the roads. Related Articles: Prince Charles warns of narrow window to face climate change More than 880,000 Canadian jobs vulnerable in global clean energy transition Queen Elizabeth II back at castle following hospital visit On Oct. 14, Insulate Britain paused its organized blocking of many major roads that had caused traffic misery for drivers in and around London. The group says it wants the country’s Conservative government to insulate “all of Britain’s 29 million leaky homes by 2030, and all social housing by 2025,” a policy that it says will pay dividends in the urgent battle against climate change. The resumption of the roadblocking campaign comes days before the start of the U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in the Scottish city of Glasgow. Many environmentalists are calling the Oct. 31-Nov. 12 gathering the world’s last chance to turn the tide in the battle against climate change. Tony Hill, 71, said he had traveled hundreds of miles from his home in northwest England to join Monday’s protest in the City of London. “I’m here today out of anger, fear and determination,” Hill said. “The anger that my government is failing the people of our country. The governments of the world are failing everyone. Everyone says we’re at the eleventh hour, but we’re at midnight, and nothing substantial is being done by our government and governments across the world.”",

    "full_description": "The cryptocurrency-centric bank Silvergate Capital ( NYSE:SI ) reported a mixed bag of results for the third quarter on Tuesday. On a positive note, its earnings per share hit a record level of $0.88. However, usage of its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) platform declined. SEN, a real-time payments platform, allows parties on the network to clear transactions instantly, which comes in handy for institutional cryptocurrency investors and exchanges. The quantity of transfers on SEN dropped from nearly $240 billion in Q2 to about $162 billion in Q3. But I found Silvergate's Q3 earnings conference call to be much more interesting than the report's raw numbers, as it partially answered several questions that will be much more important for the bank's overall long-term outlook. Here are the three most important things I learned from the earnings report and the conference call. 1. SEN Utilization is correlated with cryptocurrency spot trading For the first time in more than a year, SEN utilization did not increase sequentially; it fell roughly 32% from the second quarter. Management said that the dip was correlated with spot trading volumes of Bitcoin ( CRYPTO:BTC ) and Ethereum ( CRYPTO:ETH ) , which also fell in the quarter, as prices were less volatile. This makes sense. SEN is a platform used for cryptocurrency trading, so lower trading volumes should translate into less utilization. However, SEN utilization dipped by 32% while cryptocurrency spot trading fell 43%. Image source: Silvergate Capital Q3 investor presentation. Although SEN utilization is a big driver of overall activity at Silvergate, it's not like the bank saw no growth at all. As of the quarter's end, deposits were only up by about $300 million, but its average deposits across the period were up by roughly $1.3 billion. The bank added about 80 new customers to SEN, and while transaction revenue was down from Q2, it was still the bank's second-highest quarter of transaction revenue. Lastly, the bank also grew its SEN Leverage lending product -- a line of credit collateralized by Bitcoin -- by $64 million in Q3. This correlation is certainly a good way to gauge how Silvergate is doing in the quarter, but I'm hopeful that as the bank ramps up more products and services, this correlation will fade. I like the fact that the bank operates more on the transactional side of the cryptocurrency space as opposed to just holding or mining tokens. As time progresses, I think this can be a stock that gives investors exposure to Bitcoin without the same level of risk. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Tracking Diem Earlier this year, Silvergate announced a partnership with Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) under which it will be the exclusive issuer of the social media giant's long-hyped stablecoin, Diem, which will be pegged to the U.S. dollar. Facebook is partnering with Silvergate to use SEN to mint and burn the stablecoins. Management believes this is the next big opportunity for the bank, and Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said on the second-quarter earnings call that the bank would be disappointed if it couldn't launch the pilot before the end of the year. However, the bank looks less likely to make good on that schedule after Lane said on the third-quarter call that he did not have an update on the timing of the launch. Lane indicated that the holdup -- or rather, the lack of an update per se -- had to do with the fact that President Biden's Working Group Financial Markets may soon come out with recommendations and guidance in regards to the regulation of stablecoins. Waiting to act until that guidance is made public would give Silvergate and Facebook \"an opportunity to tweak or adjust anything on the margin that might be necessary prior to launch,\" he said. \"But we're waiting, just like everybody else, for that guidance to come out. And you can rest assured, as soon as it's out, we'll adjust accordingly and be out to the market.\" 3. How management is thinking about cryptocurrency regulation Ever since the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a set of recommendations for how banks worldwide should regulate cryptocurrencies, I've wondered how its proposals might impact Silvergate's business. The biggest of them is to essentially require banks to hold $1 of capital for every $1 of cryptocurrency on their balance sheets. Now, Silvergate doesn't hold any cryptocurrency assets directly, but SEN Leverage does have exposure to them, considering the loans are collateralized by Bitcoin. An analyst on the earnings call asked how the bank is thinking about capital requirements if Basel's proposal makes its way into U.S. banking regulations. Lane replied that while the regulation remains far from passage into U.S. banking law, Silvergate doesn't intend to have SEN Leverage volume exceed its regulatory capital right now, which means the bank would be compliant even if the Basel recommendations went into effect. SEN Leverage at the end of Q3 hit nearly $323 million, while the bank's total risk-based capital at the end of Q2 was nearly $872 million. Now, obviously, if the bank wants to grow, this strategy is not a long-term solution. Lane said the bank is thinking about solutions for a tougher cryptocurrency regulatory climate, including the possibility of setting up a model where the bank would originate and service SEN Leverage loans, but sell the actual loans to investors. I'm hopeful that it won't come to that because I think management is already taking strong precautions. The Bitcoin collateral for SEN Leverage is equal to or exceeds the amount of the U.S. dollar loans. Silvergate has seen no losses on these loans nor has it had to liquidate any of the Bitcoin collateral, despite some significant volatility in the price of Bitcoin. And again, the bank is already maintaining very high capital levels. Still, it's good to see management preparing for some pretty hard situations.",

BNY Mellon launched its digital asset business in Ireland this year to provide custodian services to institutional investors. Banking Giant BNY Mellon Calls for Irish Crypto Regulations U.S. banking corporation BNY Mellon, which established a crypto unit in Ireland this spring, has urged the country’s finance ministry to introduce crypto regulations while the EU rules for the space are still being developed, the Irish press reported. The bank’s digital hub in Dublin was set up to provide depository services for digital assets to institutions interested in cryptocurrency investments. A report by the Irish Independent unveils that representatives of BNY Mellon met with the Irish Minister of State at the Department of Finance Seán Fleming in May to try to convince the government about the need to adopt national crypto regulations as the European Union’s rules for the sector are still under consideration. According to Fleming’s briefing notes for the department, BNY Mellon stated: While we recognize that the European Commission’s Crypto Asset Markets (MiCA) proposal aims to create a separate regime for crypto assets at the European level, given the timeframe for this legislative action to come into effect, the national regimes quickly began to fill up the gap within their respective national jurisdictions and we believe Ireland should follow suit. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation aims to harmonize cryptocurrency legislation across the 27 EU member states with common rules regarding the custody of digital assets, capital requirements for service providers and improved investor protection. These standards should apply to both decentralized digital currencies and stablecoins backed by fiat currencies. BNY Mellon expects the new regulations to come into force not earlier than 2023. In the meantime, several European countries have moved to introduce their own legislation in recent years. The publication provides an example with the German fund location law which came into effect this summer. Its provisions loosened the rules for a category of institutional funds called ‘spezialfonds’ that can now invest 20% of their portfolios in crypto assets. “Given the accelerating change happening in other jurisdictions and to meet the changing needs of clients for digital assets, we would be happy to have a clear and comprehensive strategy to create an ecosystem of assets. Attractive digital technologies in Ireland,” the government official has been quoted as saying in the notes while BNY Mellon has declined to comment on the conversations. Irish media also revealed that the U.S. bank emphasized the importance of securing a talent pool in the country’s crypto and blockchain space that would allow members of the growing industry to deliver this type of services. The financial company further noted that within BNY Mellon, Ireland is competing with Israel and New York for relevant blockchain expertise. “Developing this talent in Ireland at a pace to meet the expected growth will be a challenge,” the banking group reportedly said. BNY Mellon has maintained presence in the Republic of Ireland in the last 25 years, operating out of offices in the capital Dublin, Cork and Wexford where it has around 1,000 employees, the report added. With a business-friendly climate and positive attitude towards financial innovation, Ireland has established itself as an attractive destination and a European base for crypto companies and fintech arms of major players seeking access to the common EU market. A number of such businesses have been opening offices there in the past few years and looking to hire professionals.

    "full_description": "International thirst quencher Coca-Cola ( NYSE:KO ) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. The company is looking to sustain the momentum it is gaining as economies are reopening worldwide. In this segment from \"Beat & Raise,\" recorded on Oct. 4 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers and Demitri Kalogeropoulos discuss what investors should watch when the company releases third quarter results. Brian Withers: [laughs] That's great. Let's move on to Coca-Cola, looks like we're right on schedule here. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: We're staying with the caffeinated beverages. [laughs] Brian Withers: Yeah, excellent. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Coca-Cola, they'll be reporting earnings in late Oct. 27. This is a big company. Their sales are really directly tied to, the way they call it as consumer mobility, which is an interesting term, but it makes a lot of sense more than almost any other consumer company I can think of. Coke sells a lot of products to, of course, retailers and stuff you can get their products at supermarkets and warehouse stores, but they are big on restaurants. We just mentioned McDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ) , and they do a lot of sales in those kind of places, restaurants, sporting events, concerts when you're out in about convenience stores. That's why their sales collapsed during the pandemic, because consumer mobility collapse, too. But this past quarter we saw a big rebound, and they rebounded in a big way. That volume was up 18 percent in Q2, with the decline in case rates, and as economies reopen and sporting events started happening again and concerts and these things. That was really good news for them that quarter. I'll be watching. Obviously we had the resurgent virus case numbers come up very shortly after that report. It's going to be interesting to watch how that really impacted Coke sales. Like I said, you'd be expect that trend has mirror how much people are out and about moving around in the third quarter. Then profit margins always great to follow here because Coke is much more focused than its biggest rival PepsiCo ( NASDAQ:PEP ) , which has snack foods, it's huge snack food business, and they're a little bit more tilted toward retailers and not so much on-the-go purchases. Coke has a much bigger profit margin, about 10 percentage points higher than I want to say, they're in 28 or so percent operating margin versus Pepsi's somewhere around the 18. That'll be something to watch to see if that maintains itself even as the pricing environment gets worse. Then finally, that updated outlook, the big question there, Coke boosted their 2021 outlook last quarter. Heading into this report, they're targeting organic revenue growth of 12% to 14%. That came with a big asterisk at the time, assuming no major uptake in case rates and things like that and social distancing. It will be something to watch if Coke has to make an adjustment to that based on what they've seen over the last few months in places like Europe and the U.S. Or if people are still out there and they're still expecting to spend heavily and get out and buy a lot of beverages? Brian Withers: There's a couple of things that run through my head, and we will get some one at a time. The first is just the steadiness of the stock chart over there on the right, it sounded like if you've had a two-year stock chart, it would've been a little bit more volatile, but It's been a real steady eddy for the past year. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Which is surprising too given how much the wild swings we've seen in their sales over the past year, that 20% volume spike. But basically, I think what happened is Coke over the last few quarters or so has eased, everyone's concern that people were nervous, that the pandemic has made some fundamental change in the competitive strength of Coca-Cola versus other drinks. But that's not happened. Coke has got back to its winning market share slowly. There hasn't been some big shift. There was during the pandemic because like I said, people were buying a lot more of their drinks in supermarkets and those places are more heavily represented by PepsiCo products, and others, so Coke doesn't quite dominate those sales channels, but it does appear over the last two quarters or so that Coke's snapping right back into its normal dominant market position. It makes sense that the stock would just get back to its old ways. Brian Withers: The other thing I think it'll be interesting to watch Coke is, it's extremely international. It has stuff all over the world. You talk about reopening and we're reopening at different rates. You would imagine certainly India region to be behind Europe and certainly behind the U.S. But it'll be in Latin America and Brazil and some of these other ones. It'll be interesting to see as Coke reports globally and it breaks its regions down. You just put a 113% number at the top but I imagine that differs greatly by region. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Absolutely. I think we'll have a good picture of where different economies were over the last three months based on this. Brian Withers: Should be a good one.",

After acquiring Radius Bank earlier this year and obtaining a bank charter, LendingClub, which uses technology and data to streamline online personal lending, began retaining a quarter of the loan volume it originates on its balance sheet and generating recurring interest income. The bank charter also enables LendingClub to use cheap deposits to fund loans and save on origination costs as well. After a very strong second quarter with this model in place, here are two reasons I am bullish on LendingClub's third-quarter earnings report. 1. A chance to prove its model further I see multiple ways LendingClub can further prove its model to investors. The company's business model is heavily reliant on loan origination volume. The company is also a leader in market share for personal loans, so if there is good overall personal loan activity in the segment in Q3, I have no doubt that LendingClub will get plenty of origination volume and have a great quarter. However, I am unclear about the level of activity in Q3. On the one hand, many banks that have reported Q3 earnings have said that the consumer has been very healthy, that credit and debit spending is strong, and that credit card loan originations were picking up in Q3. Unsecured personal loans are not the same as credit card loans, but are an alternative to them, so strong credit card origination activity could be a good sign. On the other hand, if you look at data from the Federal Reserve, non-revolving debt, which is what LendingClub's unsecured personal loans fall under, grew at a slower pace through the first two months of Q3. Total non-revolving debt volume grew about $66 billion in the second quarter. Through July and August, non-revolving debt only grew $23 billion, with one month remaining in the quarter, although it might have picked up in September as delta variant cases started to level off. Image source: Getty Images. This could be bad for personal lenders, but even if origination activity wasn't there, LendingClub could still outperform peers through its customer acquisition capabilities. In the second quarter, LendingClub originated $2.7 billion of loans. Despite adding 500,000 customers in the quarter, LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn said on the company's second-quarter earnings call that a \"large portion\" of its origination went to existing members. The new members in Q2 or others from its 3.5 million existing member base could translate into loan volume in Q3. Additionally, LendingClub saw growth in the number of home improvement loans and those used for making big purchases in Q2, and these use cases appear to have stayed hot. A survey conducted by Goldman Sachs in September showed that more than a quarter of respondents plan to do home improvements post-pandemic. Finally, LendingClub at the end of Q2 still had $512 million of high-yielding unsecured personal loans and nearly $2.3 billion of total loans on its balance sheet (including legacy Radius loans). These loans earn monthly, recurring interest income, which can partially offset any weakness in origination activity and help the fintech company beat its peers, so I really do see multiple avenues for the company to show the effectiveness of its model in Q3. 2. Management has been conservative with guidance Since implementing the new model, management has been careful not to over-promise. As a result, the company has beaten quarterly results handily in each of the first two quarters of the year. In the first quarter of the year, although the bank reported a loss of nearly $0.50 in earnings per share, it beat the consensus estimate by 40%. In Q2, the bank completely blew out analyst estimates, generating a $0.09 profit on revenue of roughly $204 million. The consensus estimate had been a $0.40 loss on revenue of $129 million. LendingClub wasn't supposed to achieve profitability until the end of this year or early 2022. The blowout results sent the stock up 50% in the week following earnings and led management to significantly raise its full-year guidance. At the beginning of the year, LendingClub projected total originations of $3 billion, revenue of $250 million, and a loss of around $140 million. After Q2 results, management guided for loan originations in 2021 to be between $9.8 billion to $10.2 billion; revenue between $750 million and $780 million; and net income ranging from a $13 million loss to a $3 million loss. Despite the unpredictability in Q3 with the rise of delta variant cases, management still provided the new guidance nearly one-third of the way into the quarter, so it likely had a pulse on how originations and revenue were trending. Also, while the economy has gone through some ups and downs recently, the consumer has remained strong and the economy has not shut down like it did in 2020 -- vaccines have proved effective in keeping hospitalizations and deaths down, and the world has learned to live with COVID-19. Therefore, I find it unlikely that LendingClub's Q3 results won't at least meet management's guidance, which would be a good performance.",

    "full_description": "On Thursday afternoon, Chipotle Mexican Grill ( NYSE:CMG ) reported stellar sales and earnings growth for the third quarter of 2021. In fact, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 87% year over year, hitting a Q3 record of $7.02. Nevertheless, Chipotle stock fell 3% on Friday, ending the day more than 8% below the all-time high it reached last month. Let's take a look at whether this pullback has created a good entry point for long-term investors. Chipotle Mexican Grill stock performance, data by YCharts . Another excellent earnings report Chipotle generated record revenue of $1.95 billion last quarter: up 21.9% year over year. Comparable sales jumped 15.1%, driving most of that growth. Excluding changes in delivery pricing, average sales per restaurant reached $2.48 million for the past 12 months, compared to $2.19 million for the prior 12-month period. The strong increase in restaurant productivity -- along with price increases implemented over the past year -- helped Chipotle expand its Q3 restaurant-level operating margin to 23.5% from 19.5% a year ago, despite inflationary pressures. Total operating margin grew at an even faster pace, reaching 12.3%, as Chipotle was able to spread its overhead costs over more revenue compared to the third quarter of 2020. As noted above, these favorable factors enabled Chipotle to post adjusted EPS of $7.02, cruising past the analyst consensus of $6.32. A solid fourth-quarter outlook Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Chipotle's guidance calls for comparable sales to continue growing at a double-digit pace. Management expects restaurant-level operating margin to decline sequentially to between 20% and 21% , due to normal seasonality, higher food costs associated with a limited-time brisket menu option, and the shift of some marketing spending from Q3 to Q4. But that would still represent an increase over Chipotle's 19.5% restaurant-level operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2020. Based on this guidance, Chipotle should post another strong year-over-year EPS increase in the fourth quarter. That said, analysts had been expecting something on par with last quarter's 87% EPS jump, which would require Chipotle to dramatically exceed its margin forecast. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill. Chipotle's forecasts do tend to be conservative, but earnings growth is still likely to moderate somewhat this quarter. As a result, the average analyst EPS estimate has retreated to $5.31 from $6.49 at the end of September. Still priced for perfection Chipotle is on track to generate full-year adjusted EPS of around $25 this year: roughly four times what it earned in 2017. While EPS growth is bound to moderate from the remarkable pace of the past few years, the fast-casual chain has plenty of upside for revenue and earnings over the next decade. Management continues to see room to eventually operate at least 6,000 restaurants in North America. For comparison, Chipotle ended the third quarter with 2,892 restaurants. Management also aims to boost average unit volumes (AUVs) above $3 million, up from around $2.5 million over the past 12 months. Higher sales per restaurant should enable the company to continue expanding its operating margin. If Chipotle grows to 6,000 restaurants over the next decade and AUVs reach $3.5 million, it would generate $21 billion of revenue. At a 15% operating margin -- well above current levels but below the highs of 2014-2015 -- that would translate to annual EPS of $80 to $100. Thus, even after its recent pullback, Chipotle stock trades for about 20 times its potential earnings a decade from now. That's an awfully expensive valuation, especially given that Chipotle's growth rate will almost certainly have moderated by then. That doesn't mean Chipotle stock is doomed. If the company can boost AUVs to $4 million or more, grow beyond 6,000 restaurants (potentially via overseas expansion), and increase its operating margin beyond 15%, it could generate enough long-term earnings growth to justify its lofty valuation. However, the company has little room for error, and that makes Chipotle stock too risky relative to its upside potential to be a good buy today.",

What Wall Street expects Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ford to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 on automotive revenue of $33.04 billion. That would be a decline from the third quarter of 2020 , when Ford generated $0.42 in adjusted earnings per share on automotive revenue of $34.7 billion. (For those new to investing in automakers , here's your key to the jargon: \"Adjusted\" figures exclude one-time charges and credits, to make year-over-year comparisons more straightforward. \"Automotive\" revenue excludes revenue from Ford Credit, the company's financial-services subsidiary, which helps us compare Ford's results to those from other automakers.) How Ford's regional businesses performed in the third quarter Sales of Ford's F-Series pickups fell 22% in the third quarter, despite high demand, as chip supplies limited production. Image source: Ford Motor Company. Ford's sales in the third quarter were hit hard by a lack of inventory, largely a result of the ongoing global shortage of automotive-grade semiconductors. Ford's overall U.S. sales fell 27.6% from a year ago, and were down 31.5% from the third quarter of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began. September was much better than July and August , as Ford was able to secure more chips and ship more vehicles to its dealers. But sales of Ford's F-Series pickups, its most important profit generators, were still down about 22% in the quarter from a year ago. Ford's sales in China were also hit by the chip shortage, as well as by ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and the flooding that hit parts of central China in July. Overall sales were down 8.5% to just over 150,000, but there was a bright spot: Sales of high-profit Lincoln models increased by 24% from a year ago, to about 23,800. Chip-supply woes hit Ford's European factories hard: Sales in Ford's traditional 20 European markets fell 35.2%, versus a 21.6% decline for the industry as a whole, as supplies of key models including the Fiesta and Focus were exceptionally tight. Ford's market share in the region fell about 1.3 percentage points from a year ago, to just 6.3%. Data source: Ford Motor Company. The chart, created by the author, compares the total vehicles delivered (or in Europe, registered) by Ford in the third quarter of 2020 (in blue) and the third quarter of 2021 (in green). There might be a big one-time charge Ford said last month that it will record about $600 million in one-time charges before the end of the year related to its decision to close two factories in India. I think we should expect at least some of that total to appear in its third-quarter results. Will Ford beat Wall Street's estimates again? Last quarter, Ford was able to generate results that crushed Wall Street's estimates : Tight inventories meant that its total sales weren't great, but Ford didn't have to offer much in the way of incentives to move the metal. Wall Street is clearly hoping for a repeat this time around, and they'll probably get it. I think it's likely that Ford's results will come in close to, or maybe a bit better than, the consensus analyst forecasts mentioned above.",

    "full_description": "Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) reported third-quarter earnings last week that revealed better-than-estimated subscriber growth. Popular hit show Squid Game had a part to play in the outperformance, no doubt. The Korean language show is reported to be the most-watched series on the platform ever. Management was thrilled by the success of the show and its outperformance in subscriber growth. The fact that Netflix is retaining and even adding subscribers even as economies are reopening is a relief to shareholders and management alike. But can Netflix keep this up? Does it have another Squid Game -level bit of content to keep subscribers interested? Image source: Getty Images. Another Squid Game is inevitable In all, Netflix added 4.4 million paying subscribers in the third quarter, and that was above management's estimates for growth of 3.5 million . Nearly all of Netflix's subscriber growth came from international segments and only 70,000 from the U.S. and Canada. The trend of lower subscriber gains from the U.S. and Canada suggests the region has made more progress in reaching interested households. Fueling the outperformance in the quarter was the surprise popularity of one of Netflix's hit shows, Squid Game . But this is not the first time Netflix has produced a hit show. Netflix is rapidly climbing the learning curve (getting better with more practice) and it's likely the company will soon have another hit show or movie to keep subscribers interested. Hit shows can attract new subscribers to the service and keep current subscribers engaged. If Netflix does not support the content engine turning out multiple hits every year, existing subscribers could start moving on to a new service. To that end, management noted that it would have a heavy slate of new content coming on the site in the fourth quarter. COVID-19-related disruptions slowed the content rollout in the first half of the year, shifting it more into the fourth quarter. Management estimates that Netflix will add 8.5 million subs in the fourth quarter, which would match the growth it achieved in the same quarter last year. Netflix's continued growth amid reopening economies is easing concerns. Some investors worried that as people got vaccinated and had more options for their time and money, they could cancel their Netflix subscription. So far, that is not playing out. Netflix is not recklessly spending on content Even better for shareholders and subscribers to Netflix, the more revenue the company generates, the more it can allocate to content production. It's a powerful flywheel that is keeping customers engaged and shareholders rewarded. Management is forecasting revenue of $7.4 billion in its next quarter, annualized it would be $29.6 billion. So far this year the company has spent 54.5% of revenue on content. If it maintains that pace next year, it could mean a hefty $16 billion spent to create shows and movies. Netflix's spending on content is measured. The company is not recklessly spending on creating new content to fuel subscriber growth. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Netflix has spent $12 billion on content. That's up from the $8.4 billion it spent during the same time last year, but that was during the more acute phases of the pandemic when production was more constrained. Certainly, it's a reasonable sum for a company that generated $22 billion in revenue in the nine months ended Sept. 30. The skillful content budget allocation has allowed Netflix's operating profit margin to expand over the years, increasing from 4.6% in 2016 to 18.3% in 2020 and on pace to surpass 20% in fiscal 2021. That could mean Netflix will continue to sustainably grow subscribers for several years.",

    "full_description": "Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) will release its fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter results on Oct. 28, which means that investors on the hunt for a fast-growing company trading on the cheap may need to act quickly, as the smartphone giant seems on track to report a solid set of numbers that could help arrest the recent slide in its stock price. AAPL data by YCharts. As seen in the chart above, Apple stock has slumped over the past few weeks despite reports that its latest iPhone 13 models are reportedly in greater demand than last year's lineup. Let's look at the reasons why savvy investors should consider taking advantage of the pullback in Apple stock. Apple's about to deliver impressive growth Recent reports suggest that Apple's iPhone 13 sales may be restrained by supply chain restrictions. The iPhone maker may have to lose out on sales of up to 10 million units of the iPhone 13, as a worldwide semiconductor shortage could cripple its production lines. The smartphone behemoth was reportedly looking to manufacture 90 million iPhone units in 2021, but third-party reports indicate that it could fall short of that mark. As it turns out, the chip shortage isn't expected to affect only iPhone production, but also to hinder the output of iPads and MacBooks. Not surprisingly, investor sentiment about Apple stock has turned negative, but one shouldn't forget the massive opportunity the company is sitting on. Image source: Getty Images. For instance, Wall Street expects Apple's fourth-quarter revenue to increase nearly 31% year over year to $84.7 billion. Earnings are expected to jump from $0.73 per share a year ago to $1.23 per share. Now, Apple hadn't issued official guidance when it released its fiscal third-quarter results in July, citing the uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, but it won't be surprising to see the company exceed the market's expectations. Apple's iPhone shipments for the quarter that ended in September are expected to jump 17% year over year to 49 million units, according to Morgan Stanley analysts' estimates. Throw in the fact that Apple is enjoying a massive bump in the average selling price of the iPhone in the 5G era, and the revenue from its biggest product line (accounting for 49% of Q3 revenue) could increase significantly. Not surprisingly, Morgan Stanley analysts expect Apple's iPhone revenue to increase 52% year over year for the September quarter. The higher ASP, along with the fact that the company's services business is growing at a nice clip, should translate to a fatter margin profile. Apple recorded a 33% year-over-year increase in services revenue in the fiscal third quarter, a trend that's likely to continue thanks to the impressive growth of offerings such as Apple TV+. All of this indicates that Apple is on track to deliver a solid set of results. More importantly, the tech giant is likely to sustain the high levels of growth, as it is at the beginning of a major upgrade cycle. Don't miss the big picture Investors shouldn't worry much about the near-term problems that may hamper Apple's iPhone production, as the company has a lot of room for growth in the 5G smartphone era thanks to its huge base of users. In January, Apple CEO Tim Cook reported that Apple had an installed base of more than 1 billion active iPhone users. The company launched its first 5G-enabled iPhone models just last year, which means that only a small fraction of its installed base is using 5G devices. The iPhone 12 (Apple's first 5G device) clocked 100 million shipments in April this year, indicating that there are millions of users still in an upgrade window. So Apple can continue to witness a solid increase in shipments over the coming years as more users upgrade to new iPhones. Throw in the improved pricing of its 5G smartphones , and it is not surprising to see why Apple's earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of nearly 20% for the next five years. That's a big jump over the yearly bottom-line growth of 8.4% the company has clocked in the last five years. Finally, with Apple trading at a trailing earnings multiple of 29, lower than the tech-heavy Nasdaq -100's multiple of more than 35, it makes sense to buy this tech stock before earnings, as a strong set of numbers and robust guidance can send its shares soaring and inflate the valuation.",

    "full_description": "Supply chains are complicated. But if you’re wondering why everything you want to buy seems to be stuck in a global traffic jam these days, the answer is relatively simple, says Karen Kancens, vice president of the Shipping Federation of Canada. “There’s been a surge in demand for imported containerized goods ,” she says. Read more: Global supply chain crisis: Why consumers should start holiday shopping now As we all got stuck at home in the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, we started buying more “things.” Instead of spending on restaurants and gym subscriptions, we started ordering, say, baking gear and dumbbells to work out in the living room. Globally, consumer demand shifted away from services and toward manufactured products. Exports from Asia, which manufactures many of the products consumers are buying in the pandemic, will be nearly 15 per cent higher by the end of this year than they were in 2019, the World Trade Organization predicts . Story continues below advertisement 2:51 Consumer Matters: Home appliances hit hard by supply chain crisis Consumer Matters: Home appliances hit hard by supply chain crisis More than a year later, that surge in demand has yet to let up and is clogging supply chains around the world, says Kancens. From finding components through loading products into containers and onto cargo ships, trains or trucks to warehouses and distribution centres, “all those touchpoints along the chain are … congested,” she says. Read more: Halloween stores relying on last year’s costumes with global supply chain backlog For consumers, the supply chain logjams don’t just mean emptier store shelves, “out of stock” signs or frustratingly long delivery times. They also mean price increases, as manufacturers and retailers pass the higher costs they’re facing due to supply delays and shortages onto shoppers. Here’s how the COVID-19 pandemic is exposing the vulnerabilities of the world’s logistics networks. Story continues below advertisement 1:48 Product shortages, delays persist due to worldwide supply chain issues Product shortages, delays persist due to worldwide supply chain issues How did we get here? Supply chains should be able to handle large volume upswings, says Kancens. But they also have to be able to operate efficiently in normal times. View image in full screen Building logistics systems that can manage sudden spikes while otherwise remaining nimble isn’t easy, she says. Story continues below advertisement But what supplier networks around the world have been facing during the pandemic isn’t just a massive jump in demand for consumer goods, it’s an increase that’s been lasting for over a year, Kancens notes. Read more: Home appliance shortage hit by global supply chain crisis. When can consumers expect relief? Despite loosening COVID-19 restrictions, the surge in e-commerce orders shows no sign of letting up, says Laurie Tannous, special advisor to the Cross-border Institute at the University of Windsor and vice president of government relations at Farrow, a customs broker and logistics provider. It doesn’t help that while global demand for consumer goods and manufacturing inputs bounced back quickly after the onset of COVID-19 and soared past pre-pandemic levels, suppliers and shippers struggled to ramp up activity. As lockdowns spread from Asia to Europe and then North America in the early months of 2020, both manufacturers and transportation service providers drastically scaled back capacity, Kancens and Tannous note. Read more: Supply chain snarls: Freeland says Canada watching ‘very, very closely’ for spillover By the summer of 2020, things were looking up, and consumers were ordering everything from patio furniture to standing bikes – anything that would make housebound pandemic life a little less dreary. Story continues below advertisement But while placing an order online takes little more than a click of the mouse, factories and transportation firms had to call back staff and work with COVID-19 safety protocols, among many other issues. “When you reduce capacity, you’re laying off workers, you’re doing various things. You don’t just get those things back overnight,” Kancens says. The fact itself that many factories re-started at the same time after weeks of idling contributed to creating supply-chain clogs, Tannous says. “All those goods are trying to get on containers at the same time,” she says. Read more: First, it was the semiconductor chip. Could a tire shortage be next? Shipping containers, meanwhile, weren’t where they were supposed to be. By the spring of 2021 factories in Asia were humming away making products and parts to be shipped abroad. Containers loaded with exports from Asia headed out to Europe and North America, but because much of the rest of the world was still implementing strict COVID-19 restrictions, “those containers did not come back quickly enough,” according to a report by logistics company Hillebrand. But even without the issue of containers sitting empty on the wrong side of the supply chain, it’s become clear there simply aren’t enough giant steel boxes for all the stuff that’s supposed to crisscross the globe right now, according to Tannous. Story continues below advertisement 1:50 Truck driver shortage amplifying supply chain pressures Truck driver shortage amplifying supply chain pressures A shortage of everything Containers are just one of the shortages supply chain managers are trying to work around right now. The same supply-demand mismatch that has affected all kinds of manufacturing inputs and consumer products has also impacted commodities like lumber and steel. Meanwhile, inclement weather in many parts of the world has also resulted in shortages of agricultural products like wheat. Story continues below advertisement Read more: Natural gas price hikes will fuel inflation and hit low-income Canadians the hardest A similar narrative holds for energy resources. As COVID-19 restrictions loosen again and economic activity around the world picks up speed, demand for fuels like gasoline, diesel and natural gas has increased fast. But in some cases, the uncertainties of the global pandemic have made producers reluctant to make significant capital investments in new drilling programs. 1:50 Natural gas prices will push heating bills higher this winter Natural gas prices will push heating bills higher this winter – Oct 7, 2021 When it comes to natural gas, for example, high demand is running up against unusually low inventories. This, combined with other factors, is driving prices to record levels, especially in Asia and Europe. And permeating virtually every aspect of the supply chain is a shortage of people. Employers around the world have been struggling to find enough workers to fill available jobs, especially in lower-paying jobs that may present a higher risk of COVID-19 contagion. Story continues below advertisement Read more: There are plenty of jobs out there. Why aren’t Canadians filling them? The pandemic has also triggered a wave of early retirements in a number of sectors. Canada’s trucking industry, for example, is facing an estimated shortage of around 20,000 drivers. To put that in context, the number of drivers handling all of the Canada-U.S. cross-border trade comes to about 160,000, says Stephen Laskowski, president of the Canadian Trucking Alliance. “Not only did we have a shortage of drivers prior to the pandemic, we had one of the oldest demographics in our workforce,” Laskowski says. Read more: High furnace oil, propane prices could leave some Canadians scrambling this winter Similarly, some major international ports have been struggling to find enough labour to offload ships, and warehouse workers are also in short supply, Tannous says. All the shortages are creating delays that cascade and compound through the supply chain ultimately resulting in emptier shelves or extra long delivery times, she adds. 5:03 Canadians feeling the pinch as inflation rate soars to 18-year high Canadians feeling the pinch as inflation rate soars to 18-year high How supply chain woes are driving up prices The shortages and backlogs aren’t just creating delays. They’re also pushing up costs. Story continues below advertisement Container prices, for example, have reached record levels. The average cost of shipping a container from the Asia Pacific region, which makes up nearly 70 per cent of monthly shipping volume to North America, rose by 63 per cent between March and July, write RMS economists Tuan Nguyen and Joseph Brusuelas. The cost of sending a container from Europe increased even more — by nearly 80 per cent — in the same period. 3:38 Canada’s inflation rate hits highest level in two decades Canada’s inflation rate hits highest level in two decades Tannous says she’s heard from clients who’ve seen the cost of a container skyrocket from $2,500 to a mind-boggling $25,000. The energy crunch, meanwhile, is translating into fuel surcharges for transport via both ship and truck, say Kancens and Laskowski. But higher energy prices are also making it more expensive to operate many factories and farms, further driving up production costs. In addition to container and fuel prices, companies are also finding that freight rates are climbing, Kancens says. Story continues below advertisement To circumvent the global transport backlog, some retailers like Ikea Canada and Walmart in the U.S. are buying their own containers or chartering their own vessels. Those kinds of emergency solutions are also likely introducing extraordinary costs for companies, Tannous says. And finally, there are wages. Employers who are struggling to fill vacancies are increasing pay in an effort to lure in new workers, Tannous adds. It all feeds into massive cost increases that companies are increasingly willing to pass on to consumers. In Canada, inflation hit 4.4 per cent in September, the highest level since 2003. In the U.S. it edged up to 5.4 per cent in the same month, a 13-year high. Eventually, the pricey gridlock will clear our, according to Tannous. Some consumers will give up on buying goods that seem perennially delayed or out of stock, while companies will figure out better workarounds, she says. But it will take time, she adds. “ I think probably at some point halfway through 2022, we’re going to see some resolution.” © 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",

    "description": "The Facebook Papers: Social Network Shaken by Content, User Woe",
    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook has been struggling to attract younger users for more than a decade, and some senior employees are alarmed over the company’s inability to keep teens engaged. When asked by analysts about growth prospects, Facebook executives frequently paint a rosier picture than the one depicted by internal research, a whistle-blower alleges.Those are just some of the findings outlined in a cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, and provided to Congress in redacted form by her legal counsel. A consortium of 17 U.S. news organizations, including Bloomberg, has obtained the redacted versions received by Congress.The documents provide rare, vivid insight into ways Facebook, under the guidance of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, created a Silicon Valley social media behemoth that -- while frequently posting lavish sales and profit gains -- has also faltered in its mission to give users the tools they need to build community and bring the world closer together.In its own defense, Facebook points to new products and services it is developing to attract younger users; it notes that hate speech represents well under 1% of overall content on its platform and is declining; it says that it uses research, hypothetical tests and other methods to analyze how it recommends content and improve on efforts to curb the spread of harmful content. Facebook also contends that it has made adequate disclosures concerning growth and that the documents Haugen shared with the SEC represent a “curated selection” that “can in no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us.”Even so, the company’s missteps are beginning to take a toll. The documents chronicle worsening morale among some staff and disagreements over the best way to combat bad content; Facebook’s shares have lost more than 10% since the Wall Street Journal began publishing stories based on the whistle-blower’s documents; and lawmakers, already weighing legislation that would rein in Facebook’s power, are calling for even more stringent oversight.Other insights gleaned from the documents, researchers and people familiar with Facebook, including current and former employees:Continue Reading.

    "full_description": "When someone thinks of a \"Warren Buffett\" stock, you don't normally associate it with Generation Z -- the generation born after 1997. After all, Buffett turned 91 a few months ago and is mostly known for investments in candy, insurance, and railroads -- not cloud software, crypto, and meme stocks. But one thing Buffett does seek out is durable brands that can stand the test of time. That's what it looks like he's found in American Express ( NYSE:AXP ) , which Buffett bought back in the early 1990s. After spending much of the past 30 years positioning itself as a premium brand for well-off clients who like to travel, AmEx's management appears to have found its stride with the younger generation -- and it's showing up in the company's financials. Image source: Getty Images. Earnings have impressively roared back sooner than expected American Express just reported its earnings on Friday, Oct. 22, blowing away analyst estimates. Revenue surged 25%, with earnings per share up a whopping 75% over the past year. The quarter's $2.27 EPS figure beat analyst estimates by a huge $0.50. It's true that AmEx was lapping the second full quarter of the pandemic and therefore had somewhat easy comparisons. Still, American Express' bent toward travel and leisure, as well as corporate travel, was supposed to keep its earnings power at bay until the pandemic had fully passed. And the emergence of this summer's delta variant could have thrown a wrench into the recovery. Yet AmEx's billed business turned positive versus 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic. And that's all the more remarkable considering travel and leisure spending, baby boomer spending, and large enterprise travel spending still lag pre-pandemic levels, by a lot. So how did American Express outperform? Pivoting benefits, courting millennials and Gen Z AmEx's outperformance came from incredibly strong performance from its millennial and Gen Z cohorts. While this combined group makes up only 27% of AmEx's consumer spending, millennial and Gen-Z billed business surged 48% year over year and even 38% when compared with 2019. That compares with a 9% increase from Gen X (39% of AmEx's consumer spending) and a 6% decline from baby boomers (34% of AmEx consumer spending). And that trend looks to continue, as 75% of new Gold and Platinum cards came from millennials and Gen Z last quarter. Overall, Amex increased new card acquisition by 86% to 2.6 million, up from 1.4 million cards acquired in the year-ago quarter. While American Express may seem like a relic of a former era, but this pivot has been ongoing for a few years, as management has been injecting relevant benefits for younger consumers into its premium cards while also increasing its digital capabilities. For instance, while \" buy now, pay later \" start-ups have become all the rage this year, American Express has had this capability for its card members since 2017. But it's not just the buy now, pay later functions that millennials and Gen Z are drawn to. In fact, Squeri pointed out the younger cohort enjoys travel, experiences, and access to exclusive events even more than the baby boomer generation. That, combined with the addition of digital benefits on streaming and food delivery, are helping bring in the millennials and Gen Z cohorts to the AmEx brand. On the conference call with analysts , Squeri said: [M]illennials and Gen Zs are about experiences and they're about access. And I can speak for experience, having a household of them. And so they love to travel. They love to do things. And when you look at the platinum card product, which had always been positioned as, hey, I'm a real high spender. I need to have that platinum card product, you have to look at the utility of this product. And you look at fine hotels and resorts and you look at the value that you get out of a fine hotel and resort booking with an early check-in and a late checkout and a free breakfast and $100 credit at the hotel. And then you look at streaming credits. They're online shoppers. There's rewards accelerators. There's travel credits. There's access to tickets. There's access to special card member events. It is a range of services that they use. ... So when they look at this product, it really is a lifestyle product for them, one that ranges from their everyday activities of online spending and streaming, all the way to traveling and the credits they get. Keeping the brand relevant While many card companies pulled back during the pandemic, AmEx lavished new rewards into its premium cards to retain those valuable customers, while attracting new customers seeking relevant discounts in the stay-at-home economy while racking up points to use on a future tip. Those efforts appear to be paying off. In fact, with the rewards usage it's seeing, management now sees the opportunity to raise fees, recently hiking its high-end Platinum Card fee 25% from $550 per year to $695. That's quite a bit of pricing power right there, and an important part of American Express' financials. While spending patterns and credit quality can fluctuate with the economy, as we saw during the pandemic last year, annual card fees tend to be steadier and more subscription-like. In fact, card fees were the only revenue segment that increased for American Express during the pandemic, growing 15% in 2020. In the third quarter, card fees were up 27% versus 2019, making up 12% of AmEx's revenue. But remember, this is before the recent fee increase. American Express was able to pivot its brand impressively to do right by its customers during the pandemic. Now, the company appears stronger, and with a more diverse customer base, than it was just a few years ago. When travel, leisure, and business travel fully return, AmEx will get back to full strength, but with an even broader business coming out of the pandemic than when it went in. Kudos to AmEx's management team for their pandemic performance; those management decisions made in 2020 should benefit shareholders for years to come.",

    "content": "A favorite question of interviewers is, “If you could talk to anyone in history, who would you chose?” It’s a safe bet that the choice of Vlad Tepes doesn’t come up too often – who wants to chat with someone whose nickname is ‘the Impaler’ and who many believe was the inspiration for the name if not the legend of Dracula. A ghost hunter from Tampa defied the odds on September 25th, 2021, when she claimed to speak to Vlad Tepes/Vlad the Impaler/Dracula himself as part of the international fifth annual World’s Largest Ghost Hunt. Did she ask his favorite color or which actor portrays him best? During the “World’s Largest Ghost Hunt” on the official National Ghost Hunting Day, over 100 paranormal investigation teams were at haunted locations around the world participating in paranormal investigations to celebrate “the novice, curious and expert execution of ghost hunting methods” and to promote historic preservation, unity of its investigative contributors, para-psychology research, and public education about these haunted historic sites. Live streams were broadcast from eight well-known haunted sites, including Leap Castle in Ireland, the Ohio Reformatory in Ohio, the Conjuring House in Rhode Island and Bran’s Castle in the Transylvania area of Romania. That last location is where paranormal investigator Peggy Maguire was stationed to hunt for the ghosts alleged to haunt it – including Vlad the Impaler. Historians debate whether Vlad Tepes ever lived there, was imprisoned or even visited there. Like many of the paranormal investigators participating in The World’s Largest Ghost Hunt 2021, Peggy Maguire has plenty of experience. After having a scary encounter in her teens, Maguire spent 40 years investigating ghosts in a wide variety of locations. She specializes in EVP (electronic voice phenomena) and she showed up at Bran Castle with a spirit box for EVP and dowsing rods for silent ghosts. According to her interview with the Tampa Bay Times, Maquire and her three other teammates heard voices coming from the spirit box in a foreign language assumed to be Romanian as they walked around Bran Castle, which dates back to 1212. While most historians doubt Vlad Tepes ever lived there, the believers think he was imprisoned there by the Hungarians around 1462. Sure enough, that’s where Maguire felt a connection to Dracula. A type of dousing rod (Wikipedia) “Holding a dowsing rod in each hand, Maguire asked a series of yes-or-no questions. Spread the dousing rods outward for yes and move them inward for no, she told the ghosts. Is Tepes there, she asked. Tepes’ spirit allegedly answered yes. Maguire asked Tepes to spin the rods if he was once imprisoned there. The rods spun fast. She asked Tepes to answer yes or no to whether he used the castle as a military outpost. The rods moved inward.” When the Tampa Bay Times asked Maguire if she was indeed communication with Vlad Tepes, she answered, “I think it’s a good possibility. Yes.” Does that mean she was? Hardly. Does this confirm Vlad Tepes was imprisoned in Bran Castle? No – most historians think he was held in a fortress in Budapest. If it wasn’t Vlad, who moved the dousing rods? Another ghost? Why would it lie to Maguire? The video of Maguire’s experience at Bran Castle is available for a fee so you can decide for yourself. Whether you believe Peggy Maguire communicated with the spirit of Vlad the Impaler or not, the World’s Largest Ghost Hunt and National Ghost Hunting Day are interesting events that illustrate the scope of ghost hunting around the world. If the coronavirus allows it, they will be held again next year on the last Saturday of September. Bran Castle will undoubtedly be on the list again. Maybe someone else can get him to talk a little more. Would replacing the dousing rods with impaling rods help? https://www.nationalghosthuntingday.com/wlgh-2021-signup/apply-to-join By Paul Seaburn Mysterious Universe",

    "full_description": "ASML ( NASDAQ:ASML ) , the world's largest maker of lithography systems for chipmakers, posted its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 20. The Dutch company's revenue rose 32% year over year to 5.24 billion euros ($6.09 billion), but missed estimates by about 50 million euros. However, its net income jumped 64% to 1.74 billion euros ($2.02 billion) as its earnings per share (EPS) rose 68% to 4.27 euros per share and cleared expectations by 0.32 euros. ASML's stock initially fell by as much as 5% following that mixed report, but it rebounded the following day and remains up nearly 100% over the past 12 months. Is ASML's stock still worth buying at these levels? Why did ASML's revenue miss expectations? ASML is a linchpin of the global semiconductor market , since leading chip foundries like TSMC ( NYSE:TSM ) , Samsung , and Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ) all use its top-tier extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers for their smallest and most advanced chips. Image source: Getty Images. ASML is the world's only provider of EUV systems, which it developed over the past three decades, and it plans to maintain that lead with its next-gen high numerical aperture (NA) EUV systems for even smaller chips over the next few years. ASML is also the world's largest supplier of deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems for less advanced chips. In other words, the global chip shortage can't be resolved without a steady supply of ASML's massive machines. Since ASML is a bottleneck for the semiconductor market, its growth in the third quarter should have been fairly easy for analysts to predict. However, ASML's net bookings actually declined 25% sequentially (but still rose 115% year over year) even as it shipped a record number of EUV systems. It attributed that sequential slowdown to a materials shortage in its supply chain and start-up issues at a new logistics center, which made it difficult to fulfill customers' requests for \"fast shipments\" -- or installations that forgo its factory acceptance tests -- to expand their capacity as rapidly as possible. ASML expects its revenue to rise 14%-21% in the fourth quarter, and reiterated its guidance for about 35% revenue growth for the full year. Why did ASML's earnings beat expectations? ASML's dominance of the lithography market gives it tremendous pricing power. Its growing mix of higher-margin EUV systems, which accounted for 47% of its bookings during the third quarter, is also boosting its margins. That's why ASML's gross margin expanded 420 basis points year over year -- as well as 80 basis points sequentially -- to 51.7% in the third quarter. It expects its gross margin to hold steady at 51%-52% in the fourth quarter, and rise from 48.6% in 2020 to approximately 52% for all of 2021. That ongoing gross margin expansion, along with the initiation of a new 9 billion euro ($10.5 billion) buyback plan in July, which will last through the end of 2023, enabled ASML to easily beat analysts' earnings expectations. Why didn't ASML suffer a post-earnings plunge? ASML's stock isn't cheap at 51 times forward earnings, but most investors refrained from selling for three simple reasons. First, ASML's revenue miss in the third quarter was caused by temporary challenges that should be resolved in the near future. Second, the global chip shortage won't end anytime soon, and ASML still doesn't face any meaningful competitors in the high-end lithography market. Lastly, ASML just updated its long-term guidance at its investor day in late September. It estimated it would generate 24 billion euros ($27.9 billion) to 30 billion euros ($34.9 billion) in revenue by 2025, which implies its annual revenue -- which hit 14 billion euros ($16.3 billion) in 2020 -- could double in four years. ASML expects its total lithography system shipments to rise from 258 in 2020 to a range of 313 (in a \"low\" market) to 452 (in a \"high\" market) by 2025, and for its gross margin to expand to 54%-56%. ASML easily surpassed its prior investor day targets from 2018, so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to sell the stock right now before it has a chance to achieve its new goals. Should you buy ASML's stock? I told investors that ASML was a solid investment back in March , when the stock was still trading in the low $500s, and I also bought some shares. I still believe ASML is a great all-around investment, and it's arguably a better semiconductor play than Intel and TSMC -- which both need ASML's systems to boost their capacity -- or the long list of fabless chipmakers that rely on third-party contract chipmakers like TSMC to manufacture their chips. ASML's stock might seem a bit expensive, but I believe it still has plenty of room to run over the next few years as it continues to dominate a key part of the semiconductor supply chain. Investors who buy the stock today will likely reap some big gains if it hits its ambitious growth targets for 2025.",

Fortunately, some recent developments bode well for Johnson & Johnson's ambitions in this lucrative market. Notching another win Most COVID vaccines currently available in the U.S. are administered in two doses given about a month apart. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is administered in only one dose. Based on real-world data and a phase 3 clinical trial, the company believes a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is 75% effective against severe cases of COVID at least 28 days post-vaccination. This efficacy compares unfavorably to that offered by the vaccines marketed by Pfizer and Moderna, and the one developed by Novavax, which has yet to earn Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. All three proved at least 90% effective at preventing COVID in clinical studies. Image source: Getty Images. However, Johnson & Johnson recently released data showing that a booster dose (or a second dose) of its vaccine given two months after the first helps increase its efficacy to 94% against critical COVID illness. On Oct. 5, the company applied for an EUA to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a booster dose of its vaccine. Then, on Oct. 15, a panel of experts convened by the FDA unanimously voted in favor of the agency granting the company an EUA. On Oct. 20, the FDA granted the company this much-anticipated authorization. What does this mean for investors? Besides earning the regulatory green light a bit later than some of its competitors, Johnson & Johnson's COVID vaccine has encountered its share of headwinds. In mid-April, health authorities decided to pause the rollout of the vaccine after it was suspected of causing blood clots in some patients (it had originally earned an EUA in late February). Regulators lifted this pause roughly a week and a half later, arguing that the known benefits outweigh the known risks, and required a new label warning on the vaccine moving forward. Indeed, this adverse event was known to have affected six patients out of more than 6.8 million who had been vaccinated. This episode is in the rearview mirror now, and with the pandemic still not over, mainly due to the more-contagious delta variant of the virus, there is still a need for vaccines. Since a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S seems to boost its efficacy, that can only be good for its sales. That's especially the case given that the FDA did not put any health-related (or similar) restrictions on who can receive a booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. But here's the catch: The company vowed not to profit from this product for the duration of the pandemic. In other words, increased sales of Ad26.COV2.S in the near term will have no meaningful impact on its bottom line. In the future, the company may profit from Ad26.COV2.S once the pandemic subsides and if COVID becomes a seasonal disease like the flu, as some have predicted . But even then, considering how competitive this market is, Ad26.COV2.S will only have a very modest impact on a company that typically generates more than $10 billion in profit every year. In other words, it is not the best idea to invest in Johnson & Johnson because of its COVID vaccine. Fortunately, there are plenty of other reasons to do so. Consider the company's diversified operations. Its pharmaceutical business, the largest by revenue, includes quite a few blockbuster products that continue to grow their sales. To pick a couple out of the bunch, the immunosuppressant Stelara racked up $2.4 billion in revenue in the third quarter (ending Sept. 30), 22.2% higher than the prior-year quarter. Cancer medicine Darzalex grew its sales by 43.7% year over year to $1.6 billion. Those are just the tip of the iceberg for the company, and it has several dozen programs in its late-stage pipeline. Label expansions and new drug approvals are routine for Johnson & Johnson. And its consumer health segment sells over-the-counter products with strong name recognition, including Listerine, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Tylenol. The company's medical devices business adds to its revenue base. Here's one more reason to invest in the company: It has raised its dividend annually for more than 50 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King . It currently offers a yield of 2.53%, higher than the S&P 500 's 1.38%, and it's maintained a conservative cash payout ratio of 47%. That makes it an attractive option for income-seeking investors. In short, Johnson & Johnson may not be the best COVID vaccine stock to buy, but it remains a solid pharma company to invest in.",

In its upcoming earnings report, which covers the selling period through late September, the tech giant will reveal how well its new products, like the iPhone 13, are selling. We'll get big updates on Apple's growing services segment, too, along with an official sales projection for the critical holiday quarter ahead. With that big picture in mind, let's look at three key numbers to watch in the announcement, set for Thursday, Oct. 28. Image source: Getty Images The sales figure Apple's iPhone refresh came in the final days of the quarter, and so the release won't play a big role in the sales figure. But CEO Tim Cook and his team will discuss consumers' appetite for the iPhone 13 compared to their expectations. The quarter benefited from new releases in the iMac segment and the iPad division, which last quarter notched some if its fastest growth in a decade. Look for Apple to extend that positive hardware momentum through the current quarter. Cook will likely highlight Apple's fast-growing services segment that carries nearly double the profit margin of its lucrative hardware unit. Soaring demand in both areas helps explain why most investors who follow the stock are looking for the company to add a head-turning $20 billion, or 31%, to its revenue footprint this quarter. Gross profit margin Apple is facing the same cost and supply chain challenges as its peers, and those issues might pressure earnings this quarter and over the holidays. The company might need to pay more for shipping and might struggle to secure enough semiconductors or other key materials. A big worry heading into the holiday season is whether Apple can fully capitalize on the unusually strong demand environment. AAPL Gross Profit Margin data by YCharts The good news is that Apple's industry-leading profitability makes it easier for it to weather these challenges. Its clout allows it to make bigger orders for materials, giving it another leg up against rivals. Still, investors will want to watch gross profit margin for signs of stress heading into the holiday season crush. That metric rose by nearly a full percentage point last quarter, to 43% of sales. Apple makes more on services (70% of sales) than it does on hardware (36% of sales). Cash returns Most of Wall Street will be focused on management's Q1 sales forecast that covers the holiday shopping period. But Apple tends to be conservative in those short-term estimates, so don't spend too much time worried about the outlook. Instead, keep an eye on cash returns. Apple entered the quarter with $72 billion of cash, giving it plenty of room to improve on the $29 billion it spent last quarter on stock repurchases and dividend payments . That cash haul has amplified shareholders' returns over the past few years, mainly by reducing Apple's outstanding share count, and raising investors' proportion of earnings as a result. The holiday season has a wide range of potential sales and earnings outcomes, but cash returns are more predictable. They're likely to keep rewarding shareholders through fiscal Q1, despite extra cost pressure and inventory challenges.",

    "full_description": "Between the stock market sitting near all-time highs, valuations looking stretched by historic measures, and risks that the Federal Reserve may start tightening monetary policy, you have good reason to worry. If a frothy market and uncertain policy have you concerned, now might be a great time to add some ballast to your portfolio to help you manage the ups and downs that may be headed our way. The good news is that not every stock has skyrocketed in the recent market run-up. There are still a handful of solid companies whose businesses are simply too boring and predictable to have been worthy of such gains. That boringness during the rally just might end up turning into resiliency during any upcoming frothiness. With that in mind, here are three resilient stocks to help solidify your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images No. 1: Comfort food for uncomfortable times J.M. Smucker ( NYSE:SJM ) is best known for its namesake jams and jellies, but the company also makes such food giants as Jif peanut butter, Folgers coffee, and pet foods like Meow Mix and Milk Bone. Analysts only expect low single digit growth from the business over the next few years, which is probably why the company trades at just 17 times its trailing earnings. That relatively reasonable valuation means that the company's dividend offers its shareholders a solid 3.2% yield, while only consuming around half of its earnings. As befitting a company in a fairly stable business line, JM Smucker increased its dividend by 10% earlier this year, with that increase representing its 20th consecutive year of rising payouts. In addition, JM Smucker carries a pretty clear balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio below 0.6 and a total debt load below two years' worth of its gross profit. All that may add up to a fairly boring business, but it is also the sign of a company that looks resilient enough to hold up reasonably well in uncertain times. Image source: Getty Images No. 2: A rock-solid insurance giant Insurance titan Prudential Financial ( NYSE:PRU ) cares so much about showcasing its rock-solid financial footing that it uses an actual rock -- the Rock of Gibraltar -- as its logo. That rock-solid position can best be seen in its balance sheet, which sports a debt to equity ratio below 0.6 and over $15 billion in cash and equivalents on hand. Although analysts are projecting only single-digit growth over the next few years, its market price below 0.7 times its book value and only around 8.5 times its anticipated earnings makes it a reasonable value. That value price means Prudential Financial can offer its shareholders a 4% dividend yield while consuming only around a quarter of its earnings. As befitting a company that cares deeply for its financial strength, Prudential Financial did reduce its dividend during the financial crisis. Still, what it pays each quarter today is what it paid for a full year before that crisis hit. That showcases just how well patient investors can be rewarded by a rock-solid business over time, even as it navigates some rough waters. When it comes to resilient businesses, it's hard to beat one that operates the way that Prudential Financial does. No, it's not going to set the world on fire with its growth potential, but it's also well set up to be a potential survivor in the frothy future we may very well have ahead of us. Image source: Getty Images No. 3: An infrastructure titan that has fortified its foundation Pipeline giant Kinder Morgan ( NYSE:KMI ) lost a lot of credibility among income-focused investors when it slashed its dividend in late 2015. Yet it did so for good reason -- to protect and shore up its balance sheet. It has done an incredible job of doing that , and it has since been able to begin restoring its payout. Kinder Morgan's dividend now sits at a juicy 6.1% yield, and its payout is well covered by its operating cash flows. Those operating cash flows held up even as it reduced its dividend, and that cash played a huge role in the company's ability to shore up its balance sheet over the last several years. Over 90% of Kinder Morgan's operations are supported by contracts that are either fee based or \"take or pay\". That means its fortunes are much more tied to the amount of oil and natural gas flowing through its pipelines than the price that energy fetches. And despite the growth of renewable energy, according to the US Energy Information Administration, oil and natural gas use is expected to continue to increase over the next few decades. That points to continued demand for Kinder Morgan's services. After all, pipelines tend to be both cost effective and among the safest ways to transport such energy. That all adds up to a fairly resilient business that looks likely to be able to continue delivering value even if we face turbulence in the not too distant future. Solid businesses in different industries for uncertain times Adding to the potential of your portfolio's overall resiliency, JM Smucker, Prudential Financial, and Kinder Morgan all operate in different industries (food, insurance, and energy, respectively). That makes it more likely that an issue that knocks one of their businesses for a loop could leave the others relatively unscathed. As a result, they're worth considering as resilient stocks on their own as well as worthy of consideration as a collection as part of a diversified portfolio . In uncertain times like the ones we may be facing, investments such as these just might be able to provide the solid foundation your portfolio needs.",

    "full_description": "Earlier this month, AbbVie ( NYSE:ABBV ) announced promising top-line results from a phase 3 study examining the efficacy and safety of Rinvoq in treating patients diagnosed with active ankylosing spondylitis. But what impact could these clinical results have on pharma stock AbbVie in the years ahead? Let's dive into the data studying Rinvoq's effect on patients with ankylosing spondylitis, as well as Rinvoq's U.S. sales potential to address this question. Image source: Getty Images. A highly effective treatment Ankylosing spondylitis is a \"rare type of arthritis that causes pain and stiffness in your spine,\" according to WebMD. Ankylosis refers to the fusion of bones or hard tissue, whereas spondylitis means inflammation in your vertebrae. While it often starts in the lower back, it can spread to the neck and damage other joints in the body as well. Since ankylosing spondylitis can result in significant pain and mobility limitations, it is important for patients with the disease to develop and modify their treatment plan with the consultation of a medical professional. One biologic drug that could soon be a tool for doctors to treat refractory and severe cases of ankylosing spondylitis is Rinvoq, which was demonstrated to be beneficial in controlling it. AbbVie enrolled 420 adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis who previously failed at least one biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) into its phase 3 clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of Rinvoq. The drug significantly reduced the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, which was demonstrated by the proportion of patients achieving an Assessment in SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 response. An ASAS40 response means that a patient has experienced at least a 40% improvement in their ankylosing spondylitis. This includes patient measures, such as the severity of back pain and the duration of morning stiffness, as well as laboratory measures of inflammation levels. The higher the ASAS number, the more impactful a therapy was for a patient. An astounding 45% of patients receiving 15 milligrams of Rinvoq each day achieved ASAS40 at week 14, which was more than double the 18% of patients receiving the placebo who achieved ASAS40 at week 14. And despite the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) caution with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors as of late, Rinvoq was well tolerated. To this point, 0% of patients taking Rinvoq had adverse events that resulted in discontinuation of treatment, compared to 1.4% of patients receiving the placebo. A large market with a need for more options Rinvoq appears to be effective and well-tolerated by patients, which is why it was approved for use in the European Union in January for three rheumatic indications, including for ankylosing spondylitis. But what could that mean for the sales potential of an ankylosing spondylitis indication here in the United States? Firstly, there are an estimated 300,000 Americans who have ankylosing spondylitis. And while the majority of patients find meaningful relief on their first DMARD, this isn't the case for all patients. In fact, 16.3% of ankylosing spondylitis patients in North America failed their first DMARD, which means the treatment was ineffective in managing the condition. Based on this data, there are approximately 49,000 ankylosing spondylitis patients who have failed their first treatment and who could need another treatment. Since I believe that Rinvoq's efficacy makes up for the potential safety concerns associated with the JAK inhibitor drug class, the drug can reasonably capture 15%, or around 7,300, of these patients. Rinvoq's annual list price for its rheumatoid arthritis indication in the U.S. is around $60,000. But since the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) believes that a value-based price for the drug would be $45,000 annually, that likely is a more appropriate figure for list price. Conservatively accounting for insurance adjustments, the company probably would receive $40,000. Factoring in 7,300 patients taking Rinvoq for ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. at a net annual price of $40,000, the indication in the U.S. could realistically haul in nearly $300 million in annual revenue for AbbVie. This would be a nice revenue addition for AbbVie, which analysts already expect will generate $56.3 billion in revenue this year. AbbVie is a soon-to-be Dividend King By way of its roots dating back to when it was part of Abbott Laboratories , AbbVie is set to become a Dividend King . Its next dividend increase should be announced in the near future. This is despite the fact that AbbVie was spun off from Abbott Labs in 2013. But to its credit, AbbVie has raised its dividend each year since the spin-off. AbbVie's dividend payout ratio is set to be in the low-40% range for this year, which is the reason for my confidence that AbbVie will soon raise its dividend and become a member of the highly respected Dividend Kings. And trading at less than nine times this year's non-GAAP earnings per share ( EPS ) forecast, AbbVie offers a market-crushing 4.8% dividend yield at an attractive price to income investors. With an already strong yield, the addition of this Rinvoq indication in the U.S. would provide more cushion for the company.",

The streaming video giant is speeding up its subscriber gains in the second half of 2021 thanks to a flood of new TV and film content. Cash flow and profit margins are expanding, too, implying soaring earnings over the next few years. But Netflix posted a second consecutive quarter of sales growth below the 20% mark that it used to routinely surpass. And co-CEO Reed Hastings and his team are projecting just 16% higher sales in the final quarter of the year. Is this the beginning of the end of Netflix's huge growth days? Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. The big prize That 20% level might seem arbitrary, but it's a good indicator of high-quality growth. Netflix executives believe its an important milestone for the business. CFO Spencer Neumann said in July that the pace was necessary to keep operating margins rising at the same impressive rate investors have seen over the past five years. Adding 3 percentage points to profitability each year is \"accomplishable for sure,\" he said, \"when we're growing in that 20% or so revenue [pace] per year .\" Hastings stressed the same figure later in the conference call, saying \"the big prize is keeping revenue growth at 20%.\" NFLX Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Tough going The bad news is that Netflix might struggle to boost sales at that rate from here on out. Sure, the 2021 fiscal year is an outlier because it is going up against the pandemic-influenced prior year that saw the video giant add 24% to its sales footprint as it gained a record 37 million subscribers. It makes sense that a slowdown would follow that surge, especially given the company's temporary pause in new content production. But Netflix is also big enough today that it is getting harder to move its revenue needle. It will enter 2022 with roughly 222 million subscribers, meaning it would need to add over 30 million paying users to boost its base by 15%. Add higher average monthly prices, and revenue might get close to that 20% mark in that optimistic growth scenario. Different kinds of growth The good news is that Netflix has lots of room to raise its prices over time. It still accounts for a tiny proportion of overall TV viewing hours -- less than 10% today. By attracting more engagement with its original content and new video game services, the company might easily reach average monthly revenue that's above the current $14.50 in the U.S. market. And, even if Netflix comes up short of that 20% annual revenue mark in 2022 and beyond, investors should see huge financial returns from the business. Netflix should start gushing free cash flow beginning next year after breaking even for the first time in 2021. Operating margin will cross 20% of sales this year, too, up from 10% in 2018. That means shareholders are likely to see strong growth over the next few years, both in subscribers and average spending, plus increasing profitability. Those are impressive factors for a business with $30 billion of annual revenue, which might be past its days of posting 20% or higher annual growth.",

    "full_description": "Year to date, Riskified and Lemonade are both down about 25%. This poor performance thus far, however, does not necessarily mean they are down and out. Both of these companies are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to disrupt their industries . While many investors have demonstrated their pessimism about the future through the stocks' prices, here's why you should not be so quickly spooked by these price drops. Image source: Getty Images. Lemonade: Bringing simplicity to a complex industry Lemonade ( NYSE:LMND ) is reinventing the insurance business, including how consumers apply for coverage and get claims approved. Its first AI bot, \"Maya\", can approve or deny applications in two minutes, while its other bot, \"Jim\", can make decisions on payouts to customers in as little as three seconds. This is a model that has been largely unreplicable by legacy insurance providers such as Aflac ( NYSE:AFL ) , a legacy insurer that was founded well before the age of AI. Lemonade's use of AI has led to faster processes, which has led to happier customers. According to a study conducted by independent insurance marketplace Clearsurance, Lemonade ranked first out of 270 renters insurance companies in terms of customer satisfaction. A whopping 98% of Lemonade customers saying they would recommend the company to a friend. The company had a rough first quarter due to payouts related to the \" Texas Freeze \" -- another reason why the stock is down 65% from the all-time high it hit in January. Despite this, the business has been moving in the right direction: The company's gross loss ratio --the percentage of revenue paid out in claims -- decreased 7 percentage points year over year, showing that the company can bounce back from hard times. The company grew its customer count by 48% year over year to over 1.2 million in Q2, and increased its premium per customer by 21% to $246. This combined to produce a 91% increase in in-force premiums to $297 million. Lemonade began issuing two new policy types this year -- life insurance and car insurance -- demonstrating its ability to capitalize on new growth avenues. The stock is valued highly, especially considering that Lemonade's business is still unprofitable. Its price-to-sales ratio of 42 is high, but not as high as the 100 times sales valuation it had at its peak. Trading at 100 times sales was extreme, even for a quality company like Lemonade, and I think the valuation has simply fallen to the high price that investors have to pay for quality growth companies. Its forward price-to-sales ratio is 33 times sales, which has fallen 60% from its highs. Another thing that spooked investors this year was the Texas Freeze, which significantly hurt Lemonade. Its gross loss ratio for Q2 2021 was 121%, which sent many investors running for the exits, even though it grew its in-force premium 89% to $252 million. Even through the Freeze, Lemonade's innovation within the space holds tremendous potential, and investors are starting to see this through its growth, customer satisfaction, and its financials. Lemonade's vision may take decades to play out, but investors who are willing to remain patient could be well rewarded. Riskified: Securing e-commerce for all As the hype from its July IPO has faded, Riskified ( NYSE:RSKD ) has been hit hard. It's now down 47% from its all-time high. Riskified uses AI to detect fraud in e-commerce transactions, and it has been effective at doing so. The company has a chargeback guarantee -- if its platform approves a fraudulent order, it will cover the losses its client takes -- and these losses are represented in its cost of goods sold. Riskified's cost of goods sold has decreased in Q2 2021 compared to 2020 -- decreasing from 47% of revenue to 40% -- proving that its AI and determinations have become more accurate. Along with the chargeback guarantee, Riskified's top 10 clients experienced an average 38% decline in their operating expenses while netting 8% more sales. It's no wonder then that three out of the 10 largest online retailers use Riskified. Landing these customers has led to 55% growth in gross merchandise volume under management in Q2 2021 compared to the year-ago quarter, along with 47% revenue growth to $56 million. The primary risk for Riskified is its path to profitability. The company lost $20 million in Q1 2021, which grew over 180% from the year-ago quarter. Most of this net loss, however, is from interest expense related to the IPO, but the company would still be losing $2 million without the interest expense. Given that the company is trading at a lofty 18 times sales, this risk could be unaccounted for the stock price, and investors are pricing in a lot of future growth. The bright side of this is that the company has $120 million in cash and is generating $3.7 million in free cash flow, so for now, it can supplement its own losses. While this main risk is important to recognize, there are signs that the company could become profitable if it lands more big customers. Riskified has already landed customers like Wayfair ( NYSE:W ) , Wish ( NASDAQ:WISH ) , and Gymshark, and continued its growth into several large international markets like Australia, China, and the UK. If Riskified becomes the top dog in this industry internationally by continuously benefiting its customers and landing big clients, shareholders could reap the benefits.",

That's why changes to the program can affect just about every household.

    "full_description": "Across the United States, most Americans are either paying into Social Security or are receiving benefits from it. That's why changes to the program can affect just about every household. And several of those changes will be occurring in 2022, according to a new announcement from the Social Security Administration . Here are three ways the benefits program will look different after the New Year. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Seniors will get larger checks In most years, retirees receive a cost of living adjustment (COLA) that increases the size of their checks. That will be the case in 2022. In fact, seniors are actually going to get the largest COLA in 40 years and will see a 5.9% benefit boost . This means the average Social Security benefit among all retired workers will increase from $1,565 in 2021 to $1,657 in 2022. While it's good news that seniors will get this extra money so their benefits don't lose buying power, retirees shouldn't be too excited about it because the increase is so large as a direct result of high inflation. Retirees must make sure they're budgeting carefully to account for the extra costs they'll incur due to rising prices so they make the most of their larger checks. 2. Retirees can work more without affecting benefits Every retiree has a full retirement age (FRA), which will be between 66 and four months and 67 for those reaching FRA next year. If you haven't hit your FRA yet, you still have the option to claim retirement benefits as long as you're at least 62. This would mean reducing your monthly checks , though. There's a caveat to be aware of if you're getting benefits before FRA. If you work and earn too much on the job, you lose some of your Social Security income . The good news is that one change that's happening next year will allow retirees to earn a little bit more money without their Social Security checks disappearing. In 2021, older workers who wouldn't hit FRA throughout the entire year were allowed to earn $18,960 before forfeiting $1 for every $2 in excess earnings. In 2022, that amount is gong up to $19,560. And for those who will hit FRA during the year, the earnings limit was $50,520 in 2021, after which benefits would be reduced by $1 for every $3 in extra earnings. This is going up to $51,960 in 2022. 3. Some workers will pay more in Social Security taxes Most current workers pay Social Security tax on all of the money they earn -- but not everyone does. Some people have earnings above the \"wage base\" limit, which is the maximum income subject to Social Security tax each year. Any money earned above the wage base limit is neither taxed nor counted when retirement benefits are calculated. The wage base limit is changing in 2022, which means some high earners will end up being taxed more for Social Security. In 2021, the maximum wage subject to Social Security tax was $142,800, but it's going up to $147,000 in 2022. Since employees pay a 7.65% Social Security tax, this means workers could pay as much as $321.30 in extra taxes. The self-employed pay double that amount since they don't have an employer to pay half their Social Security tax, so could end up paying $642.60 more over the course of the year. Both current and future retirees need to know about these changes so they are prepared for how their tax bills and benefit checks could be affected.",

To make real money on Wall Street, investors need to put time on their side. If generating serious wealth is one of your financial goals, it's perfectly achievable by practicing a buy-and-hold strategy . A great place to start would be with the following high-growth tech stocks. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Nvidia Video games remain the heart of Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) , with graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming generating 47% of the $6.5 billion revenue for the second quarter. With the gaming GPU market forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 14% through 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence, Nvidia could be generating $20 billion a year in this segment alone if its sales keep pace. Because it has an 83% market share of the discrete gaming GPU market, there's no reason it shouldn't be able to achieve that. Yet Nvidia also has its finger in the pie of artificial intelligence , data centers, and automobiles. It is using AI to make gaming even better and more immersive. Its deep learning super sampling (DLSS) technology uses AI to take low-resolution images and scale them up to high resolutions for display on high-res screens. Nvidia is also using it on its Morpheus platform to allow for cybersecurity protection of data. Data center revenue soared 35% year over year last quarter and should grow to actually become Nvidia's largest segment by 2025. Its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox completed in 2020, helped position Nvidia to be a leading supplier for networking hardware. And we haven't even begun to scratch the surface yet on its Drive AV platform for autonomous vehicles , or Omniverse, the first real-time 3D simulation and collaboration platform. These components have contributed to the nearly 300% stock growth over the past three years, and it doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. Wall Street forecasts Nvidia will see revenue growth of 25% annually for the next five years, hitting $51 billion in 2026 with earnings expected to grow even faster, at 26% annually, to $7.73 per share. The shift to digital advertising and programmatic delivery will continue to boost its top and bottom lines. Image source: Getty Images. 2. The Trade Desk At-home entertainment continues to migrate from traditional cable networks to connected TV and internet-based offerings. This opens the pathway for The Trade Desk ( NASDAQ:TTD ) to further build out its dominant programmatic ad buying platform. Through the use of bid factor technology to value ad impressions, The Trade Desk's system allows brands to collect better data on potential buyers in real-time. This ensures their ads are placed appropriately based on that data and its clients are responding. Revenue spiked 101% in the second quarter , raking in $280 million. And over the first six months of 2021 revenue was 78% higher than in the same period in 2019. Over the last four years, revenue has increased nearly 300%. Adjusted EBITDA margin also rose in the second quarter, hitting 42%, even better than the pre-pandemic rate of 36% it achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, The Trade Desk sees itself maintaining that breathless pace, with third-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA rising at least 31% and 30%, respectively, over the year-ago period. The Trade Desk serves approximately 875 clients, primarily ad agencies, which spend a lot of money on it. CEO Jeff Green told analysts, \"the number of brands spending more than $1 million in CTV [connected television] on our platform has already more than doubled year over year.\" With a performance like that, it's no wonder the stock has grown over 560% over the past three years. Equally important, the clients stick around year after year. The Trade Desk's customer retention rate has been over 95% for seven consecutive years. But where the company is likely to see much of its future growth attained is in international markets. Non-North American revenue now represents 13% of its total revenue compared to 6.5% in 2015, and with two-thirds of the world's ad spend coming from outside of North America, The Trade Desk still has a substantial runway to expand. At 80 times earnings and 88 times the free cash flow it produces, the ad-buying platform is not cheap. Yet programmatic purchases amount to only one-fifth of the spend on advertising globally, suggesting this leading player has a lot of potential to grow into its valuation.",

And in August, a record 4.3 million Americans quit their jobs, adding labor shortages to the list of headwinds. This chaos is already impacting consumers, who are finding it more difficult to buy everything from automobiles and electronics to household products and medicine. Unfortunately, experts believe it will be at least six months (and maybe more than a year) before supply chains normalize, meaning industries like construction, manufacturing, and retail are likely to face significant headwinds for the foreseeable future. However, this difficult situation may actually be a tailwind for companies like Airbnb ( NASDAQ:ABNB ) and Coupa Software ( NASDAQ:COUP ) . Here's why both of these stocks could crush the market in 2022 (and beyond). Image source: Getty Images Airbnb: A disruptive business model Airbnb is disrupting the travel and tourism industry. Its platform crowdsources lodgings from over 4 million hosts worldwide, helping guests find a place to stay in over 100,000 cities. More importantly, Airbnb offers a far greater selection, both in terms of location and real estate , than traditional hotel chains. Guests can book a private cottage by the coast, a rustic farmhouse in a small town, or a trendy apartment in the heart of a big city. Airbnb also lists a variety of unique lodgings, such as a treehouse in the rainforest or a castle on the English countryside, providing a once-in-a-lifetime experience for travelers. That advantage has helped Airbnb recover more quickly from the pandemic. Through the first half of the year, the company's revenue skyrocketed 89%. Meanwhile, Hyatt and Hilton -- the two most valuable hotel brands in the world, according to Brand Finance -- both posted revenue declines of 11% over the same period. Airbnb also saw its gross booking value rise 320% to $13.4 billion, implying strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Looking ahead, supply chain chaos and labor shortages could further reinforce Airbnb's advantage. Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta recently said difficulty staffing hotels is \"probably the single biggest issue\" that the company faces. And Hilton isn't alone. Marriott currently has over 10,000 empty positions across 600 hotels, which may translate into a poor experience for guests on its properties. Additionally, any new construction or renovation projects will likely take longer to complete in the current environment, limiting any near-term expansion plans. Meanwhile, Airbnb can onboard new hosts and expand its inventory in a matter of minutes, while incurring minimal costs. That means it can adapt to changes in consumer demand much more nimbly than its rivals. Of course, this is true even without supply chain challenges, but the current environment makes it even more relevant. Ultimately, these tailwinds should help Airbnb gain market share. That's why this growth stock is set to crush the market in 2022 (and beyond). Coupa Software: A better supply chain solution Coupa specializes in business spend management (BSM). Its platform connects its clients with over 7 million global suppliers, helping them purchase the goods and services they need to run their businesses. At the same time, Coupa's BSM tools help companies build more robust supply chains and realize cost savings through strategic procurement. For example, clients benefit from pre-negotiated discounts with suppliers -- a result of Coupa's scale -- creating a network effect that should strengthen over time. In other words, each new buyer on the platform creates value for every supplier, and vice versa. Coupa also orchestrates group sourcing events, allowing businesses to pool their collective buying power to negotiate better prices. Building on that, all of these transactions create data, and Coupa leans on artificial intelligence to make sense of that information, surfacing insights that help clients capitalize on savings opportunities and avoid risky suppliers. In fact, Coupa is the only BSM platform that offers real-time prescriptive insights, giving the company an edge over its rivals. Coupa further differentiates itself with Coupa Pay, a deeply integrated payments platform that streamlines the procurement process. Again, no other player in the industry has a comparable solution. These advantages have translated into strong financial results. In the most recent quarter, Coupa's trailing-12-month revenue surged 40% to $643 million, and while the company is still unprofitable on a GAAP basis , free cash flow hit $101 million, up 37%. Coupa also launched an App Marketplace, allowing clients to sync data with analytics tools like Microsoft Power BI and human resources software like Workday . This move further extends the functionality of its BSM platform, strengthening the value proposition for potential and existing customers. Going forward, Coupa should see an uptick in demand as supply chain bottlenecks continue to weigh on enterprises around the world. And with an addressable market at $94 billion, this tech company certainly has plenty of room to grow. That's why Coupa is set to crush the market in 2022 (and beyond).",

    "full_description": "Real estate investment trust STORE Capital ( NYSE:STOR ) isn't well known by many investors, but for investors focused on the long term, it's definitely one to put on their radar. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on Oct. 11 , Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel explains why STORE Capital is one of the largest investments in his own retirement account. Matt Frankel: STORE Capital is my second-largest real estate holding, in that I own quite a few REITs. It's my favorite sector. It's my second-largest holding, became my second-largest holding over the past year. The more they execute on their business, the more I like it. If you're not familiar with STORE Capital, they are a real estate investment trust. They're what's called a net lease real estate investment trust, which basically means they own single-tenant properties. It's a special type of leasing arrangement. I don't want to get too much into the weeds on that. But generally, it makes the most sense for when a company owns properties occupied by a single tenant, as opposed to like a mall or a shopping center, which are multitenant properties. For example, we'll go into the tenants in a minute, but for example, Camping World ( NYSE:CWH ) is one of their big tenants. They are the only tenant that occupies a Camping World property. Right now they own a little over 2,700 properties. Pretty much all of them are single tenant in nature, 64% of the portfolio is occupied by service-based businesses. Think restaurants, think preschools are a big target of theirs, auto repair businesses are a big tenant of theirs. Theater businesses, unfortunately, in 2020 are a big tenant of theirs, AMC ( NYSE:AMC ) is among their top tenants. They have 17% of their portfolio occupied by retail businesses that sell a product as opposed to a service, furniture stores, outdoor stores. Bass Pro Shops is one of their big tenants, just to name another example. The other 19% of their portfolio is operated by manufacturing businesses. Some nice little diversification from the retail. Another pretty big differentiator. Another big differentiator, STORE Capital is not the only REIT that does what it does. Realty Income ( NYSE:O ) is probably the most popular net lease REIT -- ticker symbol O -- that invest in single-tenant properties. One of the big differentiators is STORE Capital requires property-level profitability from all of its tenants. In other words, it demands property-level financials. Let's say Camping World leases 20 locations from them. They get the financials for each and every one of those 20 individual locations that gives them a real great insight into how profitable their tenants are, how the underlying businesses are doing, and it gives them a lot of foresight into predicting how their real estate is going to perform. You can make the argument this is Warren Buffett's favorite REIT. Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK.A ) ( NYSE:BRK.B ) owns just under 10% of STORE Capital. Great dividend stock. They went public in 2014. They've increased the dividend every year since including 2020, 4.7% dividend yield, which is pretty high, double the S&P 's average. Great numbers, 99.6% occupancy, which is great for a real estate stock. They estimate their addressable property market universe to be $3.9 trillion in size. There are $3.9 trillion of properties that they could conceivably acquire. They're not going to buy all of those, obviously, they don't have that much money. But the point is, this growth story can go on for a long time. They're growing quickly, they spent over $600 million on acquisitions so far in 2021 through the first half. For a company with a market cap below $9 billion, that's a pretty aggressive acquisition rate. I like this one.",

The SPDR S&P China ETF ( NYSEMKT:GXC ) , which tracks the performance of major Chinese companies listed in the U.S. and China, is down 9.5% year to date versus the S&P 500 's gain of 20%. For long-term China bulls, though, this marks an opportunity to buy the dip. Investing legend Charlie Munger, for instance, has been racking up shares in e-commerce giant Alibaba . But beyond Alibaba, the China sell-off has unlocked other potential value plays. Among them is Vipshop ( NYSE:VIPS ) , an under-the-radar e-commerce stock that's down about 55% year to date. Image source: Getty Images. A proven track record Compared to Alibaba and Pinduoduo , Vipshop is a much smaller business -- which partly explains why it's not as well known outside China. And unlike its bigger rivals, Vipshop focuses entirely on discount retail . Think of Vipshop as the online version of TJX Companies ' TJ Maxx or Ross Stores . Vipshop serves two customer groups: discount shoppers and brand owners. For shoppers, the value proposition is crystal clear. Vipshop offers a wide range of deeply discounted branded items. For brands, Vipshop is a convenient way to monetize large amounts of excess inventory or off-season products. In addition, Vipshop's lower prices effectively widen the addressable market for these brands, as they reach customers who may not have been able to afford those goods. By attracting high-quality brands, Vipshop can provide an extensive selection of not just any lower-priced goods -- but those that shoppers want. As a result, Vipshop's customers keep coming back for more. Repeat shoppers made up 76%, 80%, and 81% of Vipshop's total active customers in 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively. Last year, this customer segment accounted for 98% of Vipshop's total sales. Such a loyal customer base means Vipshop has no problem attracting brand owners and retaining existing ones. Underscoring this is that the number of brand owners on Vipshop grew 2.5 times between 2015 and 2020. As Vipshop expands its brand partnerships, it can keep attracting more shoppers. A major breakthrough for Vipshop came in 2017 when JD.com ( NASDAQ:JD ) and Tencent Holdings ( OTC:TCEHY ) bought major stakes in the company. As part of the arrangement, Tencent and JD.com integrated Vipshop into its own marketplaces, helping the discount e-tailer grow its user base. All these factors combined explain how Vipshop managed to grow active customers from 61 million in 2018 to 84 million in 2020, a 37% increase. Financially, revenue grew from 84.5 billion yuan to 101.9 billion yuan (roughly $15.94 billion) between 2018 and 2020. The steady rise in sales also led to improved operating leverage, helping profits more than double from 2.1 billion yuan to 5.9 billion yuan (roughly $920 million). Shares are on sale Betting on a proven business model -- like Vipshop's -- is a time-tested way to make money from investing. But it's equally important for investors to make sure they are not overpaying for the stock. The good news, though, is that Vipshop may be trading at a massive discount. After falling over 70% from a peak of $46 a share hit in March this year, Vipshop is trading at nine times earnings. Alibaba, for perspective, trades at more than double that multiple. To be clear, Vipshop's low valuation is not entirely unjustified. Nearly all major Chinese stocks have come under fire, facing -- among other things -- a worsening U.S.-China relationship and pressure from Chinese regulators . So far, Vipshop seems to have escaped the regulatory dragnet. But that's no guarantee this will always be the case. Moreover, investors are generally steering clear of Chinese stocks. As long they continue to do so, Vipshop's valuation may remain at depressed levels. But at the stock's current price, investors appear to be well compensated for these risks. Still in the eye of the storm Vipshop has a successful, proven business model. And with the backing of internet giants JD.com and Tencent, Vipshop is well positioned to ride the growth of e-commerce in China . In the short term, however, the tide is not in favor of Chinese stocks. With investors generally unexcited about investing in China, Vipshop's shares could fall even further. With all this in mind, new investors must be willing to hold on to the stock for the long term -- and ride out the storm.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Hengchi electric vehicles on display during the 19th Shanghai International Automobile Industry ... [+] Exhibition (Auto Shanghai 2021) on April 19, 2021 in Shanghai, China. VCG/VCG via Getty Images Hui Ka Yan has finally revealed his plan to save China Evergrande. He wants the embattled property developer to shift its focus from real estate to manufacturing electric vehicles, but skepticism abounds. Despite having never sold a vehicle, Hui’s aim is to turn away from Evergrande’s main business and become an EV maker within the next decade, the state-run Securities Times reported late Friday evening, citing an internal meeting held on October 22. The proposal sent shares of his Hong Kong-listed EV unit, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, soaring as much as 17% on Monday before closing the day with a gain of 11.4%. But the company still trades at just a fraction of its peak market value of $86.7 billion that it reached in mid-April after tumbling 94% since then. Analysts, however, have expressed their skepticism. It remains unclear whether Evergrande, now close to collapsing under $305 billion in total liabilities, has the expertise or capital to compete in China’s increasingly crowded EV field. “Evergrande used to have a strategy of buy, buy and buy,” says John Zeng, a Shanghai-based director of China forecasting at consultancy LMC Automotive, referring to the property developer’s previous EV-related acquisitions. “Its approach was very simple and unpolished, and no one really knows how much technology it has mastered. ” MORE FOR YOU China Detains Fallen HNA Ex-Billionaire Chairman Ahead Of Airline Restructuring Vote Nasdaq Listing Of Freshworks Creates Windfall For Indian Founder And Hundreds Of Employees Ninja Van Becomes Singapore’s Newest Unicorn After Raising $578 Million From Alibaba, B Capital Hui Ka Yan attends a press conference at the 12th CPPCC National Committee on March 9, 2017 in ... [+] Beijing, China. VCG/VCG via Getty Images Hui currently has a net worth of $11.6 billion that is largely based on dividend payouts received over the years. He was a former steel factory worker when he first established Evergrande in 1997. Although he had no prior experience in producing EVs when he first announced his ambition to do so in 2019, he has since funneled more than $1 billion into a series of acquisitions that saw him gain control of National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB (NEVS) and buy a majority stake in battery maker Shanghai CENAT New Energy. The company said its first EV model Hengchi would be delivered from its Tianjin factory early next year, according to an October 11 post published on Evergrande’s website. But its EV unit warned less than a month ago that it was encountering a “serious shortage of funds,” according to a September 24 stock exchange filing . The company said it had “suspended paying some of its operating expenses and some suppliers have suspended supplying for projects.” Evergrande itself warned last week that there was “no guarantee” it will be able to meet its financial obligations. The company did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Even if Hui eventually manages to begin producing EVs, how he would sell them is another question with no clear answer, says Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. “Building a sales channel from scratch is very capital intensive, and Evergrande doesn’t appear to have channels of its own,” says Zhang. “Plus, its current model is a concept car that is still quite some distance away from mass manufacturing and selling.” Justin Tang, head of Asian Research at New York-based investment and advisory group United First Partners, says the billionaire may simply be trying to boost investor confidence. Hui also pledged during the same meeting to deliver Evergrande’s unfinished properties to homebuyers, saying the company “in principle” won’t buy land over the next ten years, and would reduce the scale of its property development business “by a large margin,” according to the Securities Times report. The company said separately via its WeChat public account that its 40 real estate projects in places including Guangzhou and Foshan are progressing “smoothly and orderly.” Last week, Evergrande narrowly avoided default by paying a $83.5 million bond coupon just before a 30-day grace period was about to expire. But Evergrande faces more interest payments down the road, and $3.5 billion of its offshore bonds are expected to mature in March. The cash-strapped company has been struggling to raise funds through asset sales and other means, and market doubts over whether it can meet its debt obligations continue to persist. “Where is the money coming from?” asks Tang, adding that Evergrande “doesn’t have time as a friend,” and its proposal of saving itself by making cars has “lots of questions but no real answers.”",

The crisis in the European gas industry escalated earlier this fall, after spot gas prices soared on low-storage-capacity fears, nearly breaching the threshold of $2,000 per thousand cubic meters earlier in October. As of mid-October, European underground gas storage facilities were only 71% full. Some European countries are blaming Russia for causing the current energy crisis by not providing more gas deliveries. At the same time, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is capable of relieving European shortages by supplying additional Russian gas, is stuck in limbo due to political maneuvering in Brussels. Also on rt.com Second line of Nord Stream 2 pipeline will be filled with gas in December – Putin Russian officials have also pointed to another problem on the European energy market. They have repeatedly stressed the stability that long-term contracts in the energy sector bring, as opposed to the volatility of spot sales, which have exposed Europe to the current energy crisis, with gas prices smashing records earlier this month. According to Elena Burmistrova, Deputy Chairperson of the Management Board of Russia's state energy giant Gazprom, European countries will inevitably enter the winter heating season with underfilled storage facilities. “As of mid-September, the backlog of gas injection in Europe exceeded 22 billion cubic meters of gas. Experts in Europe and Asia say that this gap in gas injection cannot be made up. This situation will certainly stimulate demand and affect prices,” the official stated. Also on rt.com Russia boosts gas supplies to Italy by nearly 16% this year – Gazprom Russian authorities recently offered to increase gas deliveries to Europe via existing contracts. However, no applications from European counterparts have been submitted so far. Germany's Ambassador to Russia, Geza Andreas von Geir, on Monday stated that rising gas prices is a common European problem and, therefore, should be dealt with jointly. “This applies not only to Germany – this is a problem on the European level, so it is being addressed on a broader scale. As far as we know, the Russian President [Vladimir Putin] announced his readiness to contribute to the solution of the gas-price crisis. Therefore, everyone is working on this jointly,” the ambassador told reporters. For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section",

    "full_description": "Financial technology company Upstart ( NASDAQ:UPST ) has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent history, gaining more than 1,500% since its December 2020 IPO. In this Fool Live clip, recorded on Oct. 4 , Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel discusses why Upstart's gain is justified, as well as why there could be more upside potential in the years ahead. Matt Frankel: Upstart is a stock that has had AMC -like ( NYSE:AMC ) price action. But deservedly so. It's a good way I could describe it. Upstart went public just last December. About 10 months ago, Upstart went public at an IPO price of $20 a share. It's more than $300 right now, so a 15-bagger in less than a year. Sounds like AMC. You might be skeptical. This went meme-stockish for a bit. But it really didn't. If you're not familiar, Upstart, their mission is to democratize access to credit. Specifically for borrowers who don't have perfect credit scores. They're not the first company to try to do this, but they are doing the best job of it by far so far. The FICO scoring formula, which is the gold standard, does not do a good job of properly assessing default risk for customers with subprime credit scores. Just to name one example, I think it was about 80% of people in America have never defaulted on a loan obligation. Less than 50% could qualify for a lender's best rates. There's a disconnect in there. More people should be able to access credit and qualify for good rates and things like that. The subprime auto industry is especially predatory with this. It's not uncommon for people to get interest rates above 20% and that's on a secured asset loan, just because they don't have great credit and to be fair, it's not necessarily the lender's fault. It's that there's no good way to accurately predict default risk for that subset of the population. Now 20% is excessive, so it is somewhat the lender's fault. Upstart, the progress has just been fantastic. Their model shows they can reduce bank default rates for their partners by 75%. That means banks can make almost four times as many loans without increasing their default risk. That's a product that sells itself essentially. Looking at Upstart's recent numbers, you have to take them with a big grain of salt. Because there are compared to the second quarter of 2020, when no one was lending money. If I tell you that Upstart's loan volume was up 1,600% in the second quarter this year, pump the brakes on that. But what's really impressive is, one, how big the profitability is getting. Upstart's now projecting a 17% adjusted EBITDA margin. Which by the way, they are a profitable company which is rare with such a high-growth start-up. They're projecting a 17% margin as opposed to 10% that they were projecting at the beginning of the year. They've increased their revenue guidance twice for the full year of 2021 so far. At the beginning of the year, they were projecting $500 million in revenue. At the end of the first quarter, they bumped that up to $600 million. Now they're expecting $750 million in revenue for this year. They are exceeding even their own wildest expectations and all of this is from their legacy personal loan business. They haven't even really scratched the surface into auto lending, which is where they see the most potential and where I agree. The next couple of years are going to be really interesting. If all goes well in the auto lending business and they can replicate their personal loan success even half as well as they've done so far, their current valuation will be more than justified and they can be a big winner from here.",

These allow you to diversify your portfolio, but the ETFs trade like stocks. If you want to invest in an index, Vanguard offers a wealth of low-cost options. Narrowing your choices down to three can seem overwhelming, but these ETFs could help you reach millionaire status. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Vanguard Russell 3000 ETF The Vanguard Russell 3000 Index Fund ETF ( NASDAQ:VTHR ) is a way to invest in nearly the entire U.S. stock market. The more than 3,000 holdings represent 98% of the domestic market. U.S. equities have done well for a long time. Over the last year, the fund returned nearly 32%. In the last decade, you would have received almost 15% per year. During that time, your money would've grown by nearly fivefold. Of course, the past is no guarantee for the future. However, it's fairly safe to assume that the U.S. stock market will perform well over the long haul. 2. Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. ETF Now that you've gotten the U.S. stock market covered, you might want to add geographic diversification by investing in the rest of the world. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. ETF ( NYSEMKT:VEU ) is a good way to go. The fund invests in about 3,600 stocks across the globe. It puts most of its assets, 40%, in Europe, with another 27% in the Pacific and 25% in emerging markets. Most of the remaining funds, 6%, are invested in North America. Hence, you get a wide range of stocks spread out over the entire world. That's beneficial in case one region runs into problems. This ETF returned nearly 24% over the past year and has an average annual return of about 8% over the last 10 years. During that span, you would've more than doubled your money. 3. Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF It's not a bad idea to add bonds to your portfolio to add more stability and a steady income generator. There's a variety from which to choose, but the Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF ( NASDAQ:VCLT ) has some nice characteristics. The fund invests mostly in investment-grade corporate bonds, which tend to hold up better than lower-rated bonds since the credit quality is better. About 51% of the assets were in BBB-rated bonds, and another 38% were rated A. Of course, you could invest in U.S. government securities, but investment-grade bonds have a higher yield, 3.1%, for the extra risk. The fund also buys securities with longer maturities. Vanguard gives it a risk rating of 3, right in the middle of its five-point scale. Over the last year, the return was only 2.5%. But its 10-year annualized return was 6.8%, meaning you would have roughly doubled your money in that span. While the two equity funds are at the higher end of the risk spectrum, the bond fund moderates this somewhat. Additionally, if you have a long time horizon, you should get rewarded for this elevated risk. The nice part is, since these are index funds, Vanguard keeps expenses ultra low. These range from 0.05% to 0.10%. Of course, since the funds spend less money on certain administrative functions, that means you get a higher return. While going after high-return funds is exciting, these steady, low-cost options are one way to help you reach millionaire status.",

    "full_description": "Since the turn of the 20th century, the stock market has been the leading wealth-creating machine. Even taking into account the down years, stocks have consistently outperformed bonds and commodities over the very long term. But in recent years, equities have been left in the dust by cryptocurrencies . For instance, Bitcoin ( CRYPTO:BTC ) , the largest digital currency by market cap, has returned nearly 8,000,000,000% since making its debut at $0.0008 per token in July 2010. However, it's not Bitcoin that's generating the most buzz in the crypto space of late. That honor belongs to Shiba Inu ( CRYPTO:SHIB ) . Image source: Getty Images. Four reasons Shiba Inu is on fire Named after the Japanese dog breed that inspired this meme coin, Shiba Inu has returned more than 5,350,000% since it debuted on Aug. 1, 2020. SHIB's incredible success is the result of four factors. First, Shiba Inu has found its way onto a number of popular cryptocurrency exchanges in 2021. Investors having access to buy SHIB is the first step to potentially increasing adoption. Second, like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu is taking its bullish cues from Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk. Musk recently adopted a Shiba Inu-breed dog named Floki and has been tweeting positively about Dogecoin and the Shiba Inu breed for months. Anytime a tweet remotely links to Shiba Inu dogs from Musk, buyers take their cue to pile into SHIB . The third catalyst for the company was the launch of ShibaSwap in July 2021 . ShibaSwap is a decentralized exchange that allows investors to stake their SHIB in order to earn interest. Although staking is nothing new in the crypto space, the ability to generate returns via staking should encourage SHIB owners to hang onto their tokens for a longer amount of time. Fourth and finally, momentum is working in Shiba Inu's favor. When an asset rises more than 5 million percent in less than 15 months, you can bet that investors are going to pile in for fear of missing out (FOMO). Image source: Getty Images. Six figures that should seriously worry Shiba Inu's investors Though it would appear SHIB has upside aplenty, a half-dozen figures would suggest that the party is about to come to a crashing halt. 1. Only 91 merchants accept Shiba Inu One of the most glaring issues for a digital currency that's been around for less than 15 months is that it has virtually no utility outside of a cryptocurrency exchange. According to online business directory Cryptwerk, only 91 mostly obscure online companies accept SHIB as a form of payment. Considering Shiba Inu is a payment-oriented token, its lack of involvement on the payment front in the real-world is highly concerning. 2. 13-day average holding period Something else that should seriously concern investors is the clear lack of conviction. Based on data from leading crypto exchange Coinbase , the average holding period in Shiba Inu is just 13 days. What this tells us is that a lot of people are hoping to make a quick buck in the short-term with SHIB. Conversely, it also suggests that Shiba Inu's investors may not believe in the long-term viability of the coin and are willing to jump ship on the slightest movement up or down in price. 3. 12,968 cryptocurrencies in existence (and rising) Shiba Inu's investors are also under the constant threat of dilution -- not by other SHIB tokens, but rather by a growing number of cryptocurrency projects. CoinMarketCap.com lists 12,968 different digital currencies in existence, and this number has been growing rapidly as the total market value of cryptocurrencies has soared. Shiba Inu offers no clear competitive advantages when it comes processing transactions or via transaction fees, which is going to make it increasingly tougher for SHIB to stand out over time. Image source: Getty Images. 4. 753,092 total SHIB token holders A fourth figure to be worried about is Shiba Inu's base of roughly 753,000 token holders, per Etherscan. Even though this figure is rising, it's a pretty small number of investors considering that SHIB has pushed above an $11 billion market cap. For some added context, over 76 million people worldwide had a unique Bitcoin wallet on Blockchain.com, as of August 2021. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( CRYPTO:ETH ) has an estimated 10 million users. The point being that major cryptocurrencies need a broad base of users to become mainstream. Shiba Inu simply doesn't have that, as of right now. 5. 82.13% of all SHIB controlled by the top 100 accounts To build on the previous point, data from Etherscan also shows that the top 100 addresses own more than 82% of the 1 quadrillion token supply of Shiba Inu coins. Even taking into account that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin burned 90% of his SHIB holdings (well over 400 trillion tokens) by sending them to a dead blockchain address, having so many tokens in the proverbial hands of so few investors compromises the idea of Shiba Inu being a decentralized cryptocurrency. Even more worrisome, these remaining SHIB whales have the potential to crater the token price if they decide to sell. For instance, 50.7 trillion SHIB tokens that Buterin didn't burn were donated to the India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund. To best utilize this donation, these tokens are going to be sold. If and when these large owners bow out, remaining holders are going to feel a pinch. 6. A 5,350,880% gain in under 15 months The sixth and final figure that should terrify Shiba Inu investors is its 5,350,880% gain in less than 15 months. While this jaw-dropping gain is precisely what's inspiring the FOMO surrounding this digital currency, history is quite clear that short-term gains of this magnitude rarely, if ever, hold up . Even Bitcoin's gargantuan gains have come on the back of multiple pullbacks of at least 80%. History is most definitely not Shiba Inu's friend.",

On the other hand, there are also some hidden gems, relatively speaking. I think that these three under-the-radar stocks are great buys right now. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Cresco Labs Cresco Labs ( OTC:CRLBF ) doesn't receive as much attention as it deserves, in my opinion. One reason why is that the stock isn't listed on a major U.S. exchange. Cresco's shares are only available on the over-the-counter (OTC) market in the U.S. That's because the company operates in the cannabis industry. Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. Despite this limitation, Cresco's business has boomed in recent years. The company ranks as the top wholesaler of branded cannabis products in the U.S. It reported revenue of $210 million in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of nearly 123%. Cresco is growing organically and through acquisitions. The multi-state operator recently added its 38th retail cannabis store nationwide. It also closed the acquisition of Massachusetts-based Cultivate in September. The company expects to achieve an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion by the end of this year. With a market cap currently around $2.2 billion, Cresco's valuation is one of the most attractive in the cannabis space. 2. DermTech Some genetic testing companies have been under the spotlight over the past 18 months thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. DermTech ( NASDAQ:DMTK ) isn't one of them. However, this is definitely a stock you'll want to check out. DermTech developed a genomics test that helps diagnose melanoma. This test is 17 times less likely to miss a melanoma diagnosis than the current approach of biopsy and histology. It's significantly less expensive. As an added bonus for patients, no cutting into their skin is required. DermTech's skin genomics testing uses an adhesive patch that's placed on a lesion, removed, and sent to a lab. This test is already covered under Medicare. DermTech continues to make inroads picking up reimbursement from private payers as well. The company's main focus now is to educate dermatologists on the clear value that its test offers. DermTech is also developing new genomics tests for diagnosing other types of skin cancer and for assessing skin cancer risk. The company believes that it has an addressable annual market of around $10 billion. DermTech's market cap is only around $900 million right now. This stock could have explosive potential. 3. Trupanion Name as many medical insurance companies as you can. I suspect that Trupanion ( NASDAQ:TRUP ) didn't make the list. But it's actually one of the most promising insurers around. The twist is that Trupanion provides medical insurance for cats and dogs. At the end of the second quarter, the company's total number of enrolled pets topped 1 million. Its revenue in Q2 jumped 43% year over year to $168.3 million. Sure, there are other insurers that target the pet market. However, Trupanion is the industry leader. The company's insurance products offer the broadest coverage and arguably the best value for pet owners. Its software enables direct payment to veterinarians within minutes after check out, giving Trupanion another key competitive advantage. Wall Street analysts think the stock has tremendous upside over the next 12 months . However, I think the real opportunity for Trupanion is over the long term. The market penetration rate for pet insurance in the U.S. is only around 1%. Trupanion's growth opportunity is massive.",

[+] suffered a knee injury not long after this dropback Sunday at New England. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) ASSOCIATED PRESS Mike White spoke to reporters in Foxborough, Mass. on Sunday after the New York Jets’ embarrassing 54-13 loss to New England wearing a baseball cap. It wasn’t pulled down low, but the shadow from the klieg lights hid White’s eyes, adding to the air of mystery for the third-year quarterback. Like it or not for the Jets, it appears White will be stepping out of the shadows for a while. The purpose of the New York Jets’ 2021 season took a strange turn Sunday when New England edge rusher Matt Judon landed awkwardly on rookie quarterback Zach Wilson after he released the ball on a second-quarter pass. Wilson suffered an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament of his right knee. Video taken by ESPN.com’s Rich Cimini on the scene showed him limping to the postgame podium and he said that he “felt a pop” after Judon dragged him down from behind and that the knee felt “loose and unstable.” Wilson will undergo an MRI on Monday but it would appear, barring a medical miracle, that he will be out for at least a few games, if not more. “Initially, we feel good,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said about the potential severity of Wilson’s injury, “but you never know.” MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers The Jets (1-5) were coming off their bye prior to the 54-13 blowout and thus will be playing straight through now until the end of the regular season. That likely will be the end of the road for this particular team, given the fact that, even after six games in this expanded 11-game season, the playoffs seem like a distant goal. New England’s gaudy total of 551 yards of total offense can’t all be blamed on the Jets’ defense having to stay on the field too long because of their ineffective counterparts on offense. \"Top down. Starts with coaching all the way down,\" Saleh said. \"Obviously we've got to be better. They punched us in the freaking mouth.” With that harsh reality in mind, signing or trading for a veteran quarterback to replace Wilson for the time being doesn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense. If the Jets were in legitimate contention for the playoffs, reaching out to, say, Cam Newton would make sense. Yes, the 32-year-old Newton’s skills are somewhat in decline, but he has the savvy and mobility to be an upgrade over the still-learning White. And in this offense, in which playcaller Mike LaFleur almost never dials up a deep ball, Newton’s faltering arm strength would not be an issue. But the Jets seem to like White, a fifth-round draft pick of Dallas in 2018. Remember, they chose not to sign a veteran to back up Wilson in the first place. And although White (20-for-32, 202 yards) threw two interceptions in relief of the injured Wilson, he also showed flashes of why the Jets liked him in the first place. His first NFL pass, a touchdown to Corey Davis, was placed where only Davis could get it, making sure the Jets could either kick a field goal or try again on fourth down. “First you worry about your friend on the ground, worrying about his well-being, how he was faring,” White said of his thoughts when Wilson was hurt. “And then you kind of realize, all right, it’s my shot to go in there and help execute the offense. I told myself not to do anything out of the ordinary, just play within the system.” If White gets the temp job and displays something in Wilson’s absence, the Jets might have themselves a viable backup or a trade chip going forward. If not, no harm, no foul. The chances of a veteran saving the season, and negating a struggling, young defense, don’t seem all that appetizing right now. New York has journeyman Josh Johnson on the practice squad. He might be elevated to the active roster or the Jets could sign someone else, presuming White becomes the stopgap starter. As for Wilson, this certainly could slow his development on the field. But maybe it will give him a chance to step back and see things from a different perspective, which might help him process things better when he does return to action. Whenever that may be.",

    "full_description": "Image source: The Motley Fool. HSBC Holdings plc ( NYSE:HSBC ) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Oct 25, 2021 , 2:30 a.m. ET Contents: Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investor and Analysts Conference Call for HSBC Holdings Plc's Earnings Release for 3Q 2021. For your information, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Thank you. Good morning or afternoon wherever you are. Ewen is going to take the bulk of the call today and he'll do that in future Q1 and Q3 announcements. For today though, let me start by saying that I'm really pleased with our third quarter performance. We have had a strong quarter of profit generation across all regions, supported by another quarter of net ECL releases. What most pleasing is the underlying revenue growth we are now seeing across the business. We feel that we are turning the corner on revenue after absorbing interest rate impacts over the last few quarters. We have got strong fee growth in all businesses. [Technical Issues] In Global Banking and Markets, revenue is starting to stabilize and that's against the backdrop of a large managed reduction in risk-weighted assets and lending balances, as we indicated back in February 2020. In terms of customer behavior, we're seeing a strong deposit performance without any material drawdown on the liquidity that we've built up over the last two years. The lending market was softer than we anticipated in the quarter, particularly in corporate loans, but the pipelines that we built up, position us well for when companies start investing in both the recovery and the low carbon transition. Our capital, as our revenue starts to normalize -- sorry on capital as our revenue starts to normalize, we've also looked to normalize our capital position. Capital returns to shareholders will be a big component of this and I'm pleased to announce a share buyback of $2 billion, which we expect to start shortly. On our strategy, we're executing with exactly the kind of base I promised in February. We've made some important announcements in the quarter, including the acquisition of AXA Singapore. This complements our existing Singapore business very well and accelerates the buildout of our product and distribution capabilities, in one of the world's most important markets. Pre-COP26 we've been working incredibly hard with clients governments and our industry peers on accelerating the low carbon transition. We're working with a range of partners to find new ways to open the sustainable finance market for projects and investors. Four months ago, we announced the pioneering partnership with Temasek, to create a debt financing platform for sustainable infrastructure in Southeast Asia, which I believe provides an important model for others to follow. This is just one of a number of sustainability partnerships that we hope to announce in the coming weeks, and I look forward to updating you on those shortly. In terms of the financial industries contribution, the task force of international banks that I am encouraged to [Phonetic] share over the recent months, just released a guide for banks on setting and delivering net zero targets. This is an unprecedented collaboration, that makes an important contribution to help all banks operationalize the targets they've set. And importantly to bring consistency and coherence for our customers, regulators and investors. I'm really excited about the months ahead. There is real dynamism and optimism within the business and we're focused on delivering growth in the areas we've targeted. With the added benefit of interest rate rises on the horizon, we're in a strong position moving into 2022. With that, I'll hand over to Ewen, to take you through the detail. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Thanks Noel and good morning or afternoon all. We had another good quarter reported pre-tax profits of $5.4 billion, up 76% on last year's third quarter, with an annualized return on tangible equity of 9.1% for the year-to-date. Adjusted revenues were down 1% on last year's third quarter, but up 1% excluding certain volatile items, with a welcome return to more consistent top line growth across most of our business lines. Expected credit losses were $659 million net released -- our third quarter in a row of net releases, with net releases for the year to-date of some $1.4 billion. We still retain 31% of Stage 1 and 2 ECL reserve build out we made in 2020. Operating expenses were broadly stable, increases in investment in technology spend were offset by the impact of our cost saving initiatives. But due to some inflationary pressures, ongoing investment into growth, and additional costs due to the impact and timing of recently announced M&A activity, we now expect our adjusted costs for 2021 and 2022 to remain broadly stable at around $32 billion, excluding the U.K. bank levy. Lending balances were down by $6 billion or 1%. This was due to the repayment of $14 billion of short-term IPO lending in Hong Kong, stripping out the impact of the IPO loans, lending grew by $8 billion or 3% annualized during the quarter, with further good growth in mortgage lending and trade finance. Our core Tier 1 ratio was up 30 basis points at 15.9%, primarily due to a reduction in risk-weighted assets. We now intend to reach our target for core Tier 1 of 14% to 14.5% by the end of 2022. This will reflect a combination of some regulatory driven RWA impacts, balance sheet growth and capital return. Today's $2 billion buyback announcement is part of this commitment to accelerate the normalization of our core Tier 1 position. Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.81 was unchanged in the second quarter. Turning to slide 4, we're seeing good signs of growth returning across our global businesses. In Wealth and Personal Banking, we've continued to grow Asian net new money and Private Banking and Asset Management. We've increased the value of new business and insurance by 59% year-on-year. We've hired 450 new wealth planners and Pinnacle, our new Chinese insurance venture. We've kept our U.K flow market share comfortably above our stock share, and we've made good progress on new customer acquisition. In Commercial Banking, we're seeing encouraging trends in global trade, with good market share growth in key markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and we've maintained a strong business pipeline, with $64 billion of new approved limits. In Global Banking and Markets, we saw a more stable revenue compared to a strong performance in the third quarter last year, with good revenue growth in both security services and equities, and GB&M performance was achieved, despite a 7% reduction in risk-weighted assets year-on-year. Looking geographically; in Asia, we're seeing strong underlying revenue trends, excluding insurance market impacts, revenues were up 7% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year. And in the U.K., ringfence bank revenues were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-on-year, with fee income up 25% over the third quarter last year. Finally and importantly, we are delivering on our goal to be a leader in the transition to net zero. We helped issue $170 million of Green bonds year-to-date including leading on a number of pioneering green bond offerings, such as the first U.K. green gilt, and we're making good progress against the commitments we made in our AGM special resolution in May. Turning to slide 5 and looking at third quarter adjusted revenues as a whole. In Wealth and Personal Banking, headline revenues were down 3% on a year-ago, but excluding market -- insurance market impacts, Wealth Management revenues grew by $145 million or 7%. This was mainly due to higher fee income and asset management and private banking, together with insurance sales growth. Personal Banking revenues fell by $31 million, due to the continuing impact of low interest rates on deposit margins. Commercial Banking revenues were 4% higher, driven by higher fee income across all products and growth and trade lending and deposit balances. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were down 3%. This was due to slower customer activity in fixed income markets versus a strong third quarter last year. However, equity has benefited from both higher client activity and volatility in Asia, and security services grew to a higher fee income and assets under custody. Slide 6 shows the revenue trend quarter-on-quarter, with growth in all three global businesses, excluding insurance market impacts. This has been driven by a combination of more stable net interest income together with good fee income growth across all our businesses, up 10% year-on-year. We're increasingly confident that we're turning the corner on revenue growth. Commercial Banking is growing. Wealth and Personal Banking is growing and Wealth Management is stabilizing in Retail Banking and Global Banking and Markets has closed to that inflection point now that the bulk of its planned RWA reductions in the business are now complete. With the expectation of policy rates from 2022 onwards, we are now confident in seeing sustained revenue growth this coming year and beyond, which together with strong cost control will help to drive a sustained improvement in core returns and operating draws. On slide seven, net interest income was $6.6 billion, up 2% against the third quarter of 2020 on a reported basis and broadly stable compared with the second quarter of 2021. On the right, the net interest margin was 119 basis points, down 1 basis point on the second quarter, primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix and continued weakness in HIBOR. Lending volumes were down in the quarter, but excluding the repayment of IPO loans, lending grew by $8 billion with continued good loan growth and mortgages in Hong Kong, in the UK, together with the ongoing growth in our global trade franchise. For 2022, with our net interest margin stabilizing, policy rate rises on the horizon and loan growth building, we're increasingly confident on the outlook for net interest income. On the next slide, we reported a net release of $659 million of ECLs in the quarter compared with an $823 million charge in the third quarter of 2020. The net release was across all our global businesses, reflecting a more stable economic outlook together with Stage 3 charges that remained very low. Despite the net releases, we continue to retain a conservative outlook on risk. We still hold $1.2 billion or 31% of our 2020 COVID-19 uplift to Stage 1 and 2 ECL reserves. For the full year, we now expect net releases to be broadly in line with the net release in the first nine months, with perhaps a very modest net release in the fourth quarter after Stage 3 charges. For 2022, we continue to expect the ECL charge for the full year to be lower than our medium term through the cycle planning range of 30 basis points to 40 basis points with more modest ECL releases expected to continue into the first half of 2022 albeit with an expected net charge after Stage 3 impairments. Turning to slide nine. Third quarter adjusted operating costs were broadly stable in the same period of last year. A $263 million increase in technology spending and a $340 million increase in investment and other costs were offset by further $600 million of cost program savings compared with the prior year with an associated cost to achieve $400 million. To-date, our cost programs have achieved savings of $2.6 billion relative to our end 2022 target of at least $5 billion in cost savings and cumulative costs to achieve spend to-date has been $3.1 billion with an intention to still spend $7 billion through the end of 2022. In terms of outlook, with some inflationary and performance related pay pressures, ongoing investment spend and additional costs due to the impact on timing of recently announced acquisitions and disposals, we now expect 2021 and 2022 adjusted costs excluding the UK bank levy to be around $32 billion. This is relative to our previous FX adjusted guidance of $31.3 billion for 2022 which included the bank levy. Turning to capital on slide 10. Our core Tier 1 ratio was 15.9%, up 30 basis points in the quarter. This reflected a decrease in risk-weighted assets from lower short-term lending, favorable asset quality movements and FX, partially offset by a decrease in CET1 including around $1.7 billion for foreseeable dividends. Excluding FX movements, risk weighted assets fell by $14.4 billion in the third quarter, driven by lower short-term IPO loan exposures in Hong Kong and positive movements in asset quality. In the third quarter, we made a regulatory deduction of 20 basis points for foreseeable dividends in the quarter. This was based on 47.5% of our third quarter EPS of $0.18, which is the midpoint of our 40% to 55% target payout ratio. The dividend accrual for 2021 so far is $3.8 billion after payment of the $0.07 per share interim dividend. Please remember that this is not guidance of our full year 2021 dividend intentions. The dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that will show-up at the full year based upon the results and outlook at the time. When thinking about the payout ratio for 2021, we will attach a much lower weight to unusually low ECLs as part of our EPS this year together with a desire to see higher dividends per share in 2022 relative to 2021. We intend to normalize our core Tier 1 ratio over the coming quarters to be back within our 14% to 14.5% target range by the end of 2022, driven by a combination of balance sheet growth, capital returns and regulatory impacts. Various things to note for your capital modeling through the end of 2022. We expect today's buyback announcement, the loss on sale of our French retail banking operations and the reversal of the current software capitalization benefit to each impact our core Tier 1 ratio by around 25 basis points and we also expect $20 billion to $35 billion of regulatory-driven RWA uplifts in 2022. So in summary, this was another good quarter, good earnings diversity across the group, our broad base returned to top line growth in most of our businesses and continued strong control on costs. While the results were flattered by net ECL releases, we're happy to be turning the quarter on revenue with robust lending platforms, growth in trade and mortgage balances and the likelihood of earlier pipeline rate rises than previously anticipated. We're increasingly confident on the revenue growth outlook for 2022. We've included a few IFRS-17 slides in the appendix. We intend to go through this in more detail on our follow-up call on Wednesday for sell-side analysts. Overall, we expect an initial downside adjustment to our insurance profits of around two-thirds and a smaller percentage adjustment to insurance's tangible equity. Importantly, there'll be no significant impact on the Group's regulatory capital and there'll be no impact on the dividend flows from our insurance businesses to the group. With slight inflationary cost pressures and the impact of IFRS 17 implementation, we remain confident in achieving returns at or above our cost of capital over the next three years, together with delivering attractive growth and attractive capital returns. Finally, we're looking to normalize our core Tier 1 ratio over the coming quarters, of which today's buyback announcement is an important first step. With that, Sharon, if we could please open-up for questions. Questions and Answers: Operator Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Hi Andy. Andrew Coombs -- Citi -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I will start with one on the buybacks and then one on costs. So when you come out and quantified the $2 billion plus buyback, can you just give us the metrics that you're using to size that. How you're thinking about this buyback [Indecipherable] buybacks going forward and basically the KPIs in your decision making process on the magnitude of those. So that would be the first question. The second question on the cost outlook, where you slightly changed your guidance, say the definition you're using. I think that, in your old guidance, the debt 1.5 and then adjusting to the levy, it looks like you have taken up the cost kind of by about $800 million. So can you just give a breakdown of what the moving parts are in the increase? How much of it is due to the timing around the M&A and divestments, how much is inflationary pressured and how much is higher compensation related to performance related pay? Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah, so look on buybacks Andy, as you would expect, that it's part heart [Phonetic] and part science. We -- our capital position is obviously in a much better place than we had anticipated at the start of the year, when we had said no buybacks for this year. We've had a combination of much higher profitability, than we expected because of lower, much lower ECLs, net releases and a slower cost to achieve being expensed through the P&L. And risk-weighted assets have also been lower than we anticipated, partly because of lower growth, but also because of lower credit rating migration. I think within today's announcement is a commitment to get back to 14% to 14.5% by the end of 2022. We are committed to using excess capital, if we can't find attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We've previously talked on inorganic, about wanting to spend up to $2 billion. In M&A, we've announced deal in Singapore -- actually Singapore, for just over $500 million. So that will give you some color of the extent of M&A activity that you might see over the next year or so. I do think that, yeah, we are likely to see, if we achieve what we think we will achieve next year, some further buyback activity in '22. On costs yeah, I think your numbers are broadly right. If you add about $300 million for M&A yeah, in terms of the sort of roughly $500 million dollars and upwards pure cost. Yeah, the bulk of that is compensation-related, and you're right, part of it is variable pay. But I would sort of put it all in the bucket of compensation costs being higher. Broadly, our total wage bill is about $19 billion out of the $32 billion of total costs. So if you've got $0.5 billion of incremental inflation on that, it is about $0.5 billion -- 2.5%, about $0.5 billion of extra compensation costs. Yeah whether you put it into fixed pay or variable pay, I think we are seeing sustained wage price pressure globally at the moment. But in terms of the incremental amount that we put into the variable pay pool this year, it's significantly more than offset by the increase in profitability that we've seen. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive I think if I could just add a color on that, to the extent that we've talked of variable pay, it's partly because we've had a good trading performance this year. And clearly we've given some indications of our view of trading performance next year being positive, and it would be right to have an appropriate level of variable pay at that point in time, in the event that trading performance next year does not materialize, then we have some flexibility on the variable pay. So it's right to also signal, that there is some fixed pay inflation pressures in the market generally, within Financial Services this point in time. So the extra top-up on costs, is a combination of fixed pay and variable pay, as a consequence of the external environment and the trading performance of the bank. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer And I think the last thing Noel also, that's important is, we've made a very conscious decision not to cut back on investment despite that inflationary pressure, in order to meet a self-imposed cost target. Andrew Coombs -- Citi -- Analyst That's great. Thank you both and thank you for the facts put out the slides and IFRS 17 as well. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tom Rayner from Numis. Please go ahead, your line is open. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Hi Tom. Tom Rayner -- Numis -- Analyst Yes, good. Thank you. Hi there, Noel. Hi Ewen. Two please, just a quick follow-up on costs and then one on revenue. You mentioned you have -- about $300 million of the increased guidance is M&A related. Can you give us some sort of estimate of how much that M&A activity might add to the revenue over the sort of next two to three years, just to get a sense. And then just on revenue, clearly more positive on the revenue outlook, you flagged a number of areas. You didn't really comment, I don't think on the outlook for the net interest margin. I look at your consensus, and it only has an increase from Q3 right out to the end of 2020, so you have about 7 basis points. And if I just take you own rate sensitivity and sort of multiply it by what's being discounted by the market, there'd obviously be a multiple of 7 basis points. I wonder if you could comment on the outlook for NIM specifically, please. Thank you. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Thanks. So on costs, look in the near term, I think AXA Singapore will add about $300 million to revenues and $300 million to costs. Obviously, we would expect that pressure to move over time. But if you plug in $300 million into '22 on the revenue side. On NIM, but change inevitable [Speech Overlap], but if you looked at current consensus if you -- yeah, it does look low, relative to the consensus policy rate rises that we now see in the markets. Just as a reminder, our biggest single sensitivity is the U.K. where a 25 basis point rise would add about $0.5 billion of income in the first year, and secondly, Hong Kong. And it does look like in the U.K., we will see two, three rate rises between now and the end of '22 coming potentially as early as the next month or so. Hong Kong, maybe a bit slower, but yes, one of the offsets to -- clear offsets to the guidance we're giving on costs today, is the fact that we do think we're going to see earlier and stronger rate rises than we had previously anticipated. Yeah, we lost about $7 billion over the last year, two years or so, as a result of a shift down on interest rates. So it has had a very, very material impact on us, and we do think with the policy rate outlook at the moment than consensus, that we should start to claw back a meaningful amount of that in the next two to three years. Tom Rayner -- Numis -- Analyst Super. Okay, thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Raul Sinha from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Raul Sinha -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Noel and Ewen. Couple of questions from my side. Maybe firstly, just staying on the revenue line. I just wanted to understand the pandemic impacts, that's still washing through your various businesses and sort of holding back the revenue line. So I was wondering if you could comment on the wealth business in Hong Kong, with -- in light of all the travel restrictions, how you think the performance in this quarter has been held back and how that might shift over the next year or so? And also in trade obviously you flagged, a very strong improvement in trade balances, but there's a lot of uncertainty around clearly, what's happening to global trade. So any thoughts on the outlook? That would be helpful. And then just a broader second question on China real estate. Thank you for the disclosure, I think we all get sort of your first order impacts and exposures are relatively limited. But I was wondering, what you think about the second order impacts on your business in the Mainland, just given defaults have spread beyond sort of single name into quite a few developers now. So how do you see that impacting the rest of your book and the rest of your business. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So maybe I'll set off and then Noel, you can add some comments then on trade and Commercial Real Estate after I finish. On Hong Kong and the border being shut, the I mean -- yeah you can see some direct impacts on things like insurance franchise. We're not as exposed, obviously to others like Pru and AIA to the Mainland Chinese insurance market, but it is a meaningful kicker to the performance of our insurance franchise in Hong Kong. Having said that, I think the value of new business in Q3 was in line with Q3 pre-pandemic. You can see certain sectors in Hong Kong continuing to suffer. The biggest border is the Hong Kong-Mainland China border rather than the International Water for Hong Kong given the pre-pandemic, about 50 million of Mainland Chinese were visiting Hong Kong in any given year. So we would expect that the border progressively reopens and it's been much slower than we would have anticipated six to nine months ago that we will just see an incremental benefit coming through to the Hong Kong business. On trade, despite supply chain disruptions, I think we're pretty pleased with the recovery that we're seeing in that business. People are holding higher working capital balances at the moment, consistent with the uncertainty that exists in the supply chains, but yeah, we do view that as a temporary feature of the global economy at the moment and that we will get back to more normality and more sustained growth in 2022. On the China real estate market, I mean, we've just been through, as you would expect a pretty intensive review of our Chinese real estate exposure, including the provisioning we've got against that where just to repeat what we said today, we've got no direct exposure to regular [Phonetic] borrowers. We're pretty comfortable with the exposure overall. In aggregate, commercial real estate in China was less than $20 billion in the context of $1 trillion loan portfolio. And I think the other thing you should read-in raw is the fact that we are doing the buyback today and the size that we're doing here it is that we're reasonably confident about where we're sitting in terms of our outlook. Noel, do you want to add anything on it? Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Just ironically on trade, there is a feature that, the more uncertain global economics are is normally the time when trade finance is in demand because of uncertainty over the supply chain, uncertainty over credit environment. So we've seen strong growth in trade balances. Part of that is a function of economic rebound. Part of that I think is a function of working capital cycles are longer today than they were pre-COVID and pre-pandemic because of the tensions in the supply chain and the bottlenecks. And part of those people tend to use documentary credit more in uncertain times than open account and therefore they turn more to the financial services sector to finance trade in a structured manner rather than financing trade in an unstructured open account methodology. So I think there's a number of reasons. And then the fourth ingredient is frankly we are taking market share in trade in Asia, in particular, particularly Hong Kong, Singapore. So those four dynamics I think are leading to very strong double-digit growth in trade. I think if you look at our trade balances from the end of last year to the end of September, we are up around about 18%, 20%. If you do a year-on-year comparison in September to September, I think we may be mid-20% growth in trade, particularly in Asia. So it's those four factors I think have played into the trade performance. On China, the only other comment I'd make is, look, there is second order risk in whatever there is a market adjustment of that size taking place in a particular industry sector and particularly one as important as commercial real estate. I think we're pretty comfortable with our position and we're staying very close to any potential second order risks. So I'll reinforce on you and say, we feel comfortable with our position of our bank in China is performing well inside a good nine months and we are well positioned on commercial real estate from a primary responder view. And we think we are well positioned on any second order risks, but before we shift I said there was no second order risks that potentially exists for all of us. Raul Sinha -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thank you, Noel. Can I just follow up on the trade margin. I don't know if you've seen sort of shift in the trade margin within the business and if you expect that to shift going forward given what we're seeing in terms of the global trade picture. Thanks. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive I'm not aware of any material shift in the margin. It's more of a volume game at the moment. But Ewen, is that your understanding? Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Look, if anything, I think it's just picked up by a few basis points, but nothing material. Raul Sinha -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Manus Costello from Autonomous. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Hi, Manus. Manus Costello -- Autonomous LLP -- Analyst Hi, I just wanted to follow-up actually on those questions about that hopefully, post-pandemic reopening. You gave us some data in the second quarter about credit card balance is growing, but I haven't seen it so far this quarter. I wonder if you could talk to us about what you're seeing in unsecured and you mentioned within the NIM that there was a negative mix shift, which had the NIM. At what point will that mix shift change so as unsecured consumer starts to grow presumably you'd start to see a positive benefit. Any color you can provide around that would be appreciated. Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, firstly on NIM, two things were going on I think to sort of push it down 5 basis point in the quarter. Firstly, it was high-ball drifted down by a couple of basis points over the quarter. We do hope we're now at the trough of that and there is a mix shift with both a higher propensity of mortgage looking on lower spread mortgage lending and the fact that we're continuing to increase our liquidity reserves at the moment. The unsecured was probably up about $1 billion underlying in the quarter for both across Hong Kong and UK and about half and half across the two markets. What we are seeing is credit card spending come back up closer to pre-pandemic levels, but what we're not seeing yet are the balances go up in line with that. I think that will help. Manus Costello -- Autonomous LLP -- Analyst Yeah. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer It should happen over-time. But at the moment, whether it's commercial customers or personal customers and we're seeing the same thing in UK mortgages, for example, people are paying down debt when they can. And I think that's just a sign of confidence at the moment that we would expect to continue to improve as we continue to move away from the depths of COVID. Manus Costello -- Autonomous LLP -- Analyst Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Yafei Tian from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yafei Tian -- Citigroup -- Analyst Thank you. I have a question around revenue. You gave a bit color that quite a lot of the optimism is coming from the higher expected interest rate in some of your markets. Besides that interest rate shift, are there any organic growth that HSBC is gaining market share that you think that where via sell side is missing that could it drive more consensus revenue upgrades from non-interest income. Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, to be clear that we're not reliant on interest rate rises to underpin the business plan that we've got the -- we are seeing with NIM stabilizing, we're probably going to see about 3% loan growth this year. We would expect mid-single digit loan growth next year. So you would expect a healthy increase in net interest income next year with or without rate rises. We're seeing very good growth in fee income as we come out of COVID. I think it's up 10% year-on-year. So the core business at the moment is seeing very good attractive growth. Interest rate rises will just come on top of that. And in terms of where we are growing, I know we said earlier, we're taking share and trade, we are up a couple of percentage points of share over the last year, both in Hong Kong and Singapore. We're continuing to grow UK mortgage share above stock share. I think we were sort of about 1% ahead of stock share in the quarter. We're growing the private bank I think ahead of peers, particularly Credit Suisse in Asia at the moment. So most of our businesses I think are flat to gaining share. Yafei Tian -- Citigroup -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Guy Stebbings from Exane BNP. Please go ahead, your line is open. Guy Stebbings -- Exane BNP -- Analyst Hi, yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one was back on cost and then one on RWA. So on costs and you briefly [Indecipherable] did it to quote a previous question, the link with the interest rate outlook, I mean how much is the new guidance intertwined with market inflation and interest rate expectations, or to put it another way policy rates don't move higher in line with market expectations, should we expect you to come in lower than that guidance? And then the second question on RWA, consensus is nearly $70 billion [Phonetic] higher by the end of next year than where we sit today. I appreciate there are some regulatory headwinds on the horizon you flagged, and you've now delivered the majority of the gross RWAs, as you've guided to, by the end of next year. But the market RWA expectations, I guess $9 billion or $7 billion next year look a little too conservative, given the starting point and what you're seeing currently in terms of lack of credit migration? Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Look on cost yeah, they are connected, but not a direct line between the inflationary pressures that we're seeing coming through the cost structure, and the fact that we expect to see earlier policy rate rises yeah. To give everyone assurance. We are actively managing our cost base, in line with what we previously thought. We're still committed to taking out $5 billion of costs over the period to the end of 2022, and we've done just over half of that so far. But on a $19 billion wage bill, if you see each percentage point is another $190 million of cost, relative to where we were at the start of the year. We're definitely seeing more inflation. The offset for that should be policy rate rises coming earlier and stronger, and if they do, that will comfortably offset the inflationary pressure we're seeing on costs. But we are not -- we are not going soft on costs, just because we think that there is a potential of rate rises, that's not how we're operating the business. On RWAs yeah, I mean, I think we've given you pretty much all of the inputs. The model -- I guess we're more confident on the RWA growth outlook for -- lending growth outlook for next year, than I think is currently in consensus. We've got it to mid-single digit loan growth. Yeah, the other thing that -- yeah we've given you the impacts on regulatory capital, you can plug in your own numbers in terms of -- we've given you our distribution policy on dividends. So the only things that you don't have is yeah, well, the profitability is going to be next year or buybacks we're going to do, and even on inorganic, we've tried to give you a steer as to what the total quantum of financial and organic that we may do as well. Guy Stebbings -- Exane BNP -- Analyst Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Omar Keenan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. Omar Keenan -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I've got a few questions on rate sensitivity, please. I was hoping you could give some color around deposit betas in your rate sensitivity disclosure, especially for the U.K. and Hong Kong, given one of your peers we assessed, the U.K. rate sensitivity, based on a sort of more realistic assumption of what deposit betas are likely to be? And any color that you can give on the proportion of deposits contractually linked to market rates in both those markets, would be very helpful? And the second part of my question on rate sensitivity is the other currencies figure of $1.5 billion. Could you perhaps just elaborate a little bit more about what the key sensitivities in terms of different currencies are there, because it's about as big as the Hong Kong sensitivity? Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So look on rate sensitivity, I think you should assume for the first one or two interest rate rises, there will be a relatively low deposit feature on that and that we will try to capture a higher than average -- capture out of those rate rises, and I think over the longer term, typically we work on the basis of about a 40% to 50% deposit beta. But in the very, very short-term, with the first rate rise, I think it will be much lower than that. Yeah, in terms of other currencies, Indian rupee, renminbi, various emerging market currencies, of which Mexico is important. I'm sure if you follow up with the IR team, they can give you a full breakdown of that. Omar Keenan -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst That's wonderful. Thanks. And could I just check the published sensitivity, is that based on 50%? Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah, so it differs by product, by market too, but roughly, yes. Omar Keenan -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aman Rakkar from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Aman Rakkar -- Barclays -- Analyst Good morning. Just to add -- most of my questions have been asked actually, but a couple of points of clarification. So thanks very much for the IFRS 17 disclosure on the insurance business. In terms of the two-thirds PBT impact that you kind of expect in 2023. I mean -- I guess that insurance profit that we would be making that adjustment to, are we talking -- is it around kind of $1.5 billion hit that we should be looking for kind of reported PBT in '23? Any clarification there would be really helpful? And then just a second on the cost to achieve, I know you are sticking with the guidance at $7 billion, but it does imply that you are going to do a lot next year. I mean could you help us understand exactly why you've not been able to spend it so far, and kind of what you are going to be doing next year with that? Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Okay. So on PBT impacts. Well yeah, $1.5 billion -- it obviously depends what your forecast is, but if that's two-third of the insurance profits in that year, then yes, it's probably not wildly out of line with what we think. But just -- again just to repeat, IFRS 17 yeah, there is no impact on dividend flow from the insurance companies to the Group. There is no impact on Group core Tier 1, the timing of earnings recognition has changed, so fundamental economics, we don't think has changed. The other thing that on tangible equity, just because I know a few people have been flying around with numbers today, we think there'll be about $3 billion plus or minus impact to tangible equity, as there was a shift and the [Technical Issues] then will be negative, but minimal, and it's still tied in with our commitment to get back to cross capital returns. On CTA, I think -- we think we'll probably spend about another $1 billion or so in Q4, which leaves us about $3 billion or so to spend in '22. We did have a slower delivery this year, a big part of that was -- a lot of our change programs are being run in India, and they obviously had a pretty severe impact, as a result of the pandemic, which meant that our hiring plans, particularly technology resources that we intended to bring on board, had been slower. So there has been about a three plus month delay to some major programs of work, and it's one of the reasons why, as a result of that, we expect costs to tick up in Q4, because we've got those ramp up and investment coming into Q4. Aman Rakkar -- Barclays -- Analyst That's great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Noble from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Robert Noble -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Good morning all. Could you talk us through how interest rates are actually hedged in those various markets, maybe it's the U.K., Hong Kong and US. And then, so we'll actually see what sort of reasons -- do you actually need medium, short rates to go up in all of those countries, or will you benefit from higher rates in the market and some not others? And then secondly just on the U.K., where do you see your front book mortgage margins are at the moment and in comparison to where they were -- where they are on the back book, what do you think recent swaps -- the increase in swaps and they are pushing rates up in the market in the U.K. now? Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer So on the hedging program, Hong Kong is very short-dated, everything reprises typically in one to three months. The U.K., there is a five year rolling hedge that we have in place, consistent with most U.K peers, I think which average duration then of about 2.5 years. The U.S. is slightly longer than the five years albeit, I think that will change, once we divest ourselves out of the retail banking business, and is not as material obviously as Hong Kong and the U.K. Yeah, if you look at the structure of our assets and liabilities, they do tend to be much more short-dated than the average peer, which is a combination the impact of the short-dated nature of Hong Kong, but also in the commercial space, trade business is relatively short-dated as well. So the second question was Robert? The second question... Robert Noble -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Sorry I was on from mortgage margins versus back book and where do you think swap spreads were [Speech Overlap]. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Front book margins are probably slightly below back book margins currently for the first time in quite a while. Yeah, we have seen some margin pressure coming through the U.K. mortgage franchise. We do still think at current rates that we're writing business comfortably above the cost of capital. But there has been some margin contraction. Robert Noble -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Great, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ed Firth from KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open. Edward Firth -- KBW -- Analyst Yeah, morning everybody. I'm sorry to go on about this interest rate sensitivity, but I guess it is quite, quite crucial in terms of the outlook. But the thing I don't really understand is, when I look at the currencies, if I look at your year one sensitivity, your sterling sensitivity is materially higher than your Hong Kong sensitivity, and yet your sterling is a bit that's hedged, the Hong Kong isn't and yet the total balances on Hong Kong are up well, orders of bank [Indecipherable] similar, but I guess you are benefiting slightly higher in Hong Kong then they are in Sterling. I think -- is it possible to help us a little bit, on why you have this huge sensitivity in sterling and perhaps not so much in places like Hong Kong, which are short-dated? Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So look, I mean firstly in Hong Kong, remember that probably around 50% of our deposit balances are in Hong Kong dollars. So yeah, there is an impact of particularly U.S. dollar book in Hong Kong I think and that interest rate sensitivity, which with the U.S. dollar is about 40% -- yeah 80% of the 50%, there is no Hong Kong dollars. So yeah, look, I need to get your detailed answer out of IR team, if you give them a call. But I assume our interest rate sensitivity analysis is correct. Edward Firth -- KBW -- Analyst You know, I suspect it's about the assumptions. It's just -- the thing we're struggling with in all areas, just trying to make sure that as people can put in any assumptions they like, whether it's actually going to happen, I guess is the key question? Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah, that's fair. But I mean we do take time to show that interest rate sensitivity and it is supposed to be helpful guidance. Edward Firth -- KBW -- Analyst Okay. No, that's great. Thanks so much. I'll speak to [Indecipherable]. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Martin Leitgeib from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Martin Leitgeb -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yes, good morning. Just a very quick follow-up on structural hedging. One of your peers has announced its intention to deploy structural hedging a little bit more, just changing I guess some of the assumption, on the stickiness of certain deposits. Is there scope just based on your comments that Hong Kong is very short-dated, 40% of Hong Kong deposits are in U.S. dollar. Would there be scope to reassess some of those deposits, and think -- have you made it similar to the U.K., that deposits have a kind of behavior maturity of ICF [Phonetic], and post that -- could this be a source for additional income going forward? And secondly on capital. I mean, first of all, thank you for the 14% to 14.5% guidance now for FY '22, just in terms of thinking about the core Tier 1 trajectory, and the end of scope for capital return for HSBC going forward over the medium term, should we use this 14%, 14.5% as a kind of a range going forward, with the scope for capital to achieving lower -- I'm just trying to get, if there is still capital inefficiencies within the Group, impacting this 14% to 14.5% range. Thank you. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So in terms of Hong Kong and the -- yeah, I mean part of the problem, Martin, as you know, it's a very short-dated book both on the asset and liability side. So the choice that we have always made, is not to run currency risk to extend duration, that there is probably a low hundreds of millions opportunity in the next few years, through improved management of our liquidity book. We've recently hired a few months ago, the Group Treasurer out of UBS to come to run our treasury business. And so I think yeah, over the next two to three years, we probably got a few hundred million dollars of upside, in terms of how we're managing our global liquidity pool. Martin, on capital I would use the full 14.5% and over the next few years, I think our aspiration is to run it toward lower end of that range if we can. As you think further out, there is obviously the impact of output flows and what that does, and depending on where they are applied and the impact on capital positions of subsidiaries, etc, we're going to have to pay attention to. To get below 14% yeah, I think we've got a big program of where to step up our capabilities and stress testing, I think our peak to trough fall in stress is still too high. But yes, that will be a multi-year program of work to -- in pre-stress testing and then go after the sort of higher risk stress areas of the bank, where we're not getting remunerated appropriately. But for the purposes of the foreseeable future, I assume that 14% to 14.5% is where we're managing too and if we can, we'll manage to the low end of that range. Martin Leitgeb -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Perfect, thank you. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. We will now take our final question from the line of Joseph Dickerson from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Joseph Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the cost versus benefit from rising rates, I guess you've made the point that you haven't lightened up on investment spend, can we just -- should we therefore assume that the 90% or so of the rate sensitivity of whatever we might assume falls through to the bottom line. I guess, what sort of quantum should we think about, fall through to the bottom line. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Well, I think the bulk of it frankly -- I mean it depends what inflationary pressure you put on a $19 billion wage bill on a $52 billion total cost base. But yeah, it's relative to the previous guidance of flat costs, if you've got 1% to 2% inflation on that, that's $300 million to $600 million of incremental cost, which I think more than gets offset by the interest rate rises. I mean what we saw over the last year, is the bulk of that we lost. We weren't able to offset with incremental cost savings. So I think we will keep, we will keep cost control tight, even if we see the benefit of rate rises coming through. Joseph Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks very much. Very helpful. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive On revenues -- Ewen, just to talk to, the amount of revenue that dropped off the P&L last year as a consequence of rate reductions was... Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer $7 billion. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive How much? Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer $7 billion. Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive So from that gives you a sensitivity of the -- the upside sensitivity of rates for the downside, that we experience, relative to a 1 or 2 percentage points movement in costs. It's a highly, highly, highly leveraged ratio on revenue to cost. Joseph Dickerson -- Jefferies -- Analyst Brilliant. Thank you. Operator That was our final question. I will now hand back for closing remarks. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer If I could just -- Noel? Noel Quinn -- Group Chief Executive Yeah listen, thank you so much for your time today. A couple of closing comments from me. First of all, I'm pleased, as I said at the beginning with the performance of the business, and I'm pleased to see good signs of growth, organic growth in fee income balanced growth, Wealth Management, so that's good. I think, more to come on that front. We remain absolutely committed to driving our cost efficiencies, as we indicated earlier this year. We acknowledge that there are some inflationary pressures through VP from good business performance and from underlying inflation. But we believe that there is offsetting revenue growth to compensate for that. And we remain committed to our return on capital target. So good progress, more still to do, we'll continue to transform the business and we will continue to grow the business. Thank you for your time. Ewen Stevenson -- Group Chief Financial Officer Thanks everyone.

The good news is we can prepare our portfolios for it. That means investing in a few names with strong earnings -- and companies that can grow revenue even when economic times are tough. Whether you're a cautious or aggressive investor, investing in these sorts of companies before a downturn is a smart move. Here, I'll talk about a retailer, a big pharmaceutical company, and the leader in the robotic surgery market. Let's take a closer look at each one. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Target You probably are wondering how a retailer could outperform when the market turns sour. After all, if the economy doesn't look too great and/or confidence is down, consumers probably won't go out on many shopping sprees. That's true. But Target ( NYSE:TGT ) has built strength in areas that will continue to thrive even in tough times. Here, I'm referring to essentials, grocery, and owned brands focused on the basics. For example, Target in one year grew its Good & Gather food brand and its All in Motion activewear brand to more than $1 billion in revenue each. People flock to Target for these kinds of items at all times. The company saw this during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. The result? Target's sales growth in 2020 totaled more than the past 11 years combined. Target's selection of pickup and delivery options also keep customers coming back. And the company is investing $4 billion annually to keep stores fresh and optimize fulfillment. Target's strategy is paying off. It's return on invested capital (ROIC) gained sharply last year and remains high. TGT Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts 2. Pfizer Demand for drugmakers' products usually doesn't suffer during market downturns. That's why it's a great idea to add a solid player with many blockbusters to your portfolio. Pfizer ( NYSE:PFE ) fits the bill. The company sells eight blockbuster products . That includes the world's most sought-after product right now: the coronavirus vaccine. Other top sellers include blood thinner Eliquis and oncology drug Ibrance. Of course, drug patents only hold up for so long. And several of Pfizer's biggest drugs will face generic competition in a few years. But the company has 100 projects in the pipeline. So it's likely Pfizer will be able to renew its offerings -- and keep up revenue growth. Pfizer's particularly interesting now because it's trading at only about 10 times forward earnings estimates. At the same time, it's a different company than it was a year ago. It's spun off Upjohn -- so that business won't weigh on earnings. And the coronavirus vaccine is set to generate more than $33 billion in revenue this year. This looks like a good time to get in on the stock. 3. Intuitive Surgical Intuitive Surgical ( NASDAQ:ISRG ) commercializes the Da Vinci robotic surgery system. It's widely used by surgeons in minimally invasive procedures. And with this, Intuitive holds nearly 80% of the robotic surgery market, according to BIS Research. Intuitive makes its money by selling and leasing Da Vinci systems as well as by selling instruments and accessories and services. In fact, instruments and accessories generate the most quarterly revenue for the company. This area represented 53% of Intuitive's total third-quarter revenue. This is important because it provides a steady stream of revenue as hospitals perform surgeries with Intuitive's equipment. Annual revenue has climbed for most of the past 15 years -- even in market downturns, surgeries must continue. The coronavirus pandemic was an exception. That's because, during the worst of the pandemic, hospitals postponed many surgeries to focus on COVID-19 patients. The impact was temporary, however. Intuitive reported a 30% increase in third-quarter revenue and a 20% increase in Da Vinci procedures. Another sign of Intuitive's health: ROIC and free cash flow are rising once again. ISRG Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts Intuitive recently completed a three-for-one stock split. This is positive because it makes it easier for investors with smaller budgets to invest in the stock. So, it opens investment up to a wider audience. Now is a good time to get in on this market leader -- and hold on through the next market downturn and beyond.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The seal of the Department of the Air Force USAF Graphic A stunning assessment was issued last week that highlights the growing mismatch between our national defense strategy and our armed services’ ability to execute that strategy. The Heritage Foundation released its annual military index report that objectively evaluated the readiness, capability, and capacity of the U.S. armed services. The ratings assigned to each service includes the following options: very weak, weak, marginal, strong, or very strong. The Marine Corps was the only service to receive a “strong” overall assessment while both the Army and Navy were deemed “marginal,” and the Air Force and Space Force were labeled as “weak.” These findings should come as a wake-up call, especially given that sources in the Pentagon indicate all branches are juggling aggressive cuts as they build their FY 2023 budgets. While there will always be debates between how much the federal government should spend on “guns verses butter,” the preamble of the Constitution very clearly states that our government exists to, “...provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare.” Given the priorities of today’s Congress one might think that the words “provide” and “promote” were exchanged. Many in the public believe that since the United States outpaces any other power in defense spending that should a conflict occur, it would be virtually impossible for the United States to lose. However, that conclusion is mistaken. Such comparisons are made wholly absent context regarding comparative national interests or basic economic buying power realities between countries. Both the possibility of war and the possibility that the United States might lose are very real and continue to grow more likely as the United States’ military advantage continues to erode. The 2018 bi-partisan National Defense Strategy Commission concluded “America’s ability to defend its allied, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt. If the nation does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences will be grave and lasting.” The report further concluded, “America is very near the point of strategic insolvency, where its “means” are badly out of alignment with its “ends.” Things have only gotten worse in the ensuing three years since that report’s release. China and Russia have grown more aggressive, and they are empowered by a range of new military technologies that challenge our own systems to the limits, often exceeding them in key areas like hypersonics and artificial intelligence. The blaring alarm contained in the Heritage report is the decline in the rating of the Air Force from “marginal” last year to “weak” this year. To those who follow the travails of the armed services this slip in rating should come as no surprise as for every year since 1990—31 years—the Department of the Air Force (that includes the Space Force) has received less funding than either the Army or the Navy. As a result of this chronic and serious underfunding, the Air Force is currently the oldest, smallest, and least ready than it has ever been in its history. It has become a geriatric force with some combat aircraft having an average age of 59 years. Capabilities on orbit are in major need of investment as well—they reflect a previous generation’s operational reality, one not aligned to handle the threats posed by China and Russia.

A Bizarre Mix Of Local Jets Rose To Meet It. Currently the Administration is not planning to program the funds necessary to upgrade the capabilities and capacity of the U.S. military to fulfil the demands of the national defense strategy. While recent Congressional funding increases for defense are helpful, they are not sufficient to rebalance capability, capacity, and readiness to a reasonable level of risk. Accordingly, the only pragmatic option left for the Department of Defense (DOD) to increase its probability of success if confronted by either of its most serious threats—China and Russia—is to reallocate funds to the services who are in most need of modernization and that are most relevant to the fights of the future: The Air Force and the Space Force, and to a lesser degree the Navy. Due to the geography of the Indo-Pacific theater and the warfighting capabilities of China, the primary U.S. force elements in that theater will be predominately provided by the Air Force, Space Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Looking at the threat and geography in the eastern European area, forces required to defeat a Russian invasion of one or more NATO states would predominately be provided by the Army, Air Force, and Space Force. In both theaters, the Air Force and Space Force will play predominant roles. Yet these are the key services where the Department of Defense has taken the most budgetary risk over the past thirty years. Considering this reality, the DOD needs to rapidly redistribute its resources to reverse the declining state of its Air Force and Space Force. They must be modernized and sized to significantly improve the independent assessment of “weak” for the U.S. to have any hope of realizing its security objectives. Without immediate attention to their modernization needs, not only will the Department of the Air Force continue to decline but so will the entire DOD. This is because no U.S. military joint force operation can be conducted without some element of the Department of the Air Force being involved. Air Force fighters not only allow strikes inside enemy territory, but they also keep ships at sea, forces on land, space and cyber operating facilities, logistics lines, and rear operating bases safe from attack. Long range bombers strike key enemy targets whose destruction yields outsized war-winning effects. These bombers, combined with inter-continental ballistic missiles, also provide strategic deterrence as two legs of the nuclear triad. Cargo aircraft and refueling tankers provide vital mobility. The global positioning satellite system provides targeting, timing, and positioning capabilities. Aircraft and satellites bring essential intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as critical communication links and command and control functions. These are not areas where the nation can afford to take risk, for without them, the entire military ceases to operate effectively. This is why the Department of the Air Force has become the indispensable force and therefore requires immediate prioritization. For over 30 years modernization of the Department of the Air Force has been deferred due to other DOD priorities. Anemic funding for new aircraft and spacecraft combined with higher-than-expected usage of current aircraft, has worn hardware and the associated personnel badly. Today, 44 percent of the Air Force aircraft inventory is operating beyond its planned service life. Only 20 percent of its fighter aircraft and 13 percent of its bombers are stealthy. That means over eighty percent of key combat aircraft are not survivable against the advanced threats posed by China or Russia. If, due to inadequate funding and slower than required modernization, the Air Force must retain older aircraft that lack the degree of survivability that will be needed to defeat modern threats, it should expect to experience high loss rates. An analysis by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies shows that if only a five percent attrition rate is applied to U.S. fighters in a simulated conflict with China, a force of 791 combat-coded fighters could be reduced to 236 fighters remaining available after just 19 days of combat. Lacking any spare capacity, it would take years to recover from such losses, during which time the United States would be exceedingly vulnerable to other threats—after losing the conflict to China. Redistributing resources among the armed services—while painful—is not a new practice. Most recently it was done between 2001 and 2021 when funding for the Army was increased by shifting budget share from the other services to compensate for the increased demand for land forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is now time to apply that same logic to ensure the DOD has the options it will require to deter, and if necessary, win in a fight against peer threats. Between FY 2002 and FY 2021, the Army received over one trillion dollars more than the Air Force, or an average of over 53 billion dollars a year more than the Air Force. It is now time to rebalance that allocation to modernize and grow the Air Force out of its current “weak” position. This is even more appropriate now given that the Army is the one DOD department that is not responsible for any leg of the nuclear triad modernization. A shift in resources of this magnitude over the next ten to twenty years is not unrealistic and will be required to recapitalize the nation’s geriatric Air Force. Priority programs to do so include the F-35 stealth fighter; the B-21 stealth bomber; the KC-46 air refueling tanker; the ground-based strategic deterrent (Minute Man III ICBM replacement); the next generation air dominance (NGAD) aircraft; the T-7 training aircraft; an advanced battle management system (ABMS); an E3A warning and control aircraft replacement; and advanced munitions as well as classified programs of various types. Space systems include more survivable, resilient satellite architectures that are not as vulnerable to attack as current designs as well as those that can conduct offensive operations. Collectively, these programs can give the U.S. military an asymmetric advantage—but they require adequate funding to ensure, and in some cases, accelerate their procurement. The Air Force has repeatedly tried to get Congress to allow it to retire its old aircraft and reduce its excess infrastructure to free up funds inside its own budget allocation to invest in modern capabilities, all to no avail. Now it is time for plan B. Without Congressional approval to retire its old aircraft, or to close excess infrastructure, and without any significant increase in its budget topline on the horizon, it is now time to redistribute the assets that DOD does possess to the services that are in the worst shape and who are the most relevant to the national defense strategy. This is the essence of “jointness”—ensuring that the right forces are available at the right places at the right times. A strong Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Space Force and Air Force are all required, but that balance no longer exists with both the Space Force and the Air Force rated as weak due to over 30 years of sitting at the bottom of the DOD’s service department funding allocations. The current Air Force Chief of Staff coined the motto of, “accelerate change or lose.” The current Secretary of the Air Force has defined his top three priorities as “China, China, China.” Without a shift in DOD resources to the Department of the Air Force soon, what the DOD risks accelerating is not “change,” but its potential of losing to China. It’s time to change that slogan to, “increase the Department of the Air Force budget share or lose.”",

But for investors, it's important to know exactly what bad really means in this context. For example, just because a stock has fallen quite a bit doesn't necessarily make it a bad investment. Sometimes, buying more shares of these beaten-down stocks is actually throwing good money after good. With that in mind, here's why I think adding $1,000 to these three stocks right now would be a brilliant move. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Brookfield Renewable Shares of Brookfield Renewable Corporation ( NYSE:BEPC ) are more than 30% below the high from earlier this year. Its sister stock, Brookfield Renewable Partners ( NYSE:BEP ) , is down more than 20% from its peak. Both of these renewable energy stocks (which share the same underlying business) remain great picks. It's a foregone conclusion that the demand for renewable energy will significantly increase over the coming years. Countries around the world, including the U.S., have committed to major carbon emission reductions. The only way they're going to make that happen is for more energy to be generated from renewable sources and less from fossil fuels. Enter Brookfield Renewable. The company already runs close to 6,000 facilities across the world that produce hydroelectric, wind, and solar power. Combined, these facilities have a capacity of around 20 gigawatts. But Brookfield Renewable's development pipeline could boost its total capacity by more than 150%. The company expects to deliver average annualized total returns in the ballpark of 15%. That's enough for both of its stocks to potentially double within the next five years. 2. Facebook You might think that everyone and their brother is down on Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) right now. The social media stock slid 15% before rebounding somewhat following allegations about its business practices by a whistleblower. This isn't the first public relations challenge that Facebook has encountered, of course. It probably won't be the last one. I suspect there are two potential scenarios that could unfold for the company -- nothing happens or the government imposes more regulations. My view is that Facebook will survive and thrive either way. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has even practically begged for government regulation in the past (although he wanted it to apply to all internet companies). It's a pretty good bet that Facebook's digital advertising revenue will continue to grow despite the controversies. The company is also attempting a major transformation by investing heavily in building the metaverse, a new internet where people can work and play together virtually. Now isn't the time to sell any Facebook shares; adding more makes a lot more sense for long-term investors. 3. Teladoc Health Teladoc Health ( NYSE:TDOC ) is, by far, the biggest stinker on the list. Shares of the virtual care company have plunged more than 50% from their first-quarter high. But Wall Street analysts think Teladoc could soar once again . I agree. Let's first address why Teladoc stock has performed so dismally this year. Investors are clearly concerned about growth slowing after the end of COVID-19 lockdowns. It is true that the company's membership growth has leveled off. However, there's more to the story. In the second quarter, Teladoc's revenue per member per month skyrocketed 142% year over year. Utilization rose to 21.5% from 16% in the prior-year period. The number of virtual care visits jumped 27.5% year over year. And remember -- many more people were at home during the second quarter of 2020. My view is that the future for virtual care remains as bright as ever. There's still a huge, untapped global market for telehealth and digital health platforms. Teladoc is the clear market leader with its customer base including over 40% of the Fortune 500. Buying more shares of Teladoc should pay off handsomely over the long term.",

    "content": "Surging natural gas prices in Europe and Asia have boosted global demand for oil products, benefiting oil refiners globally. Yet, it is these record natural gas prices have started to weigh on the refining industry. Apart from slowing down steel, chemicals, and fertilizer production in Europe, the record natural gas prices are significantly raising operating expenditures for refiners because natural gas is being used for hydrogen production at the hydrocracker and hydrotreater units that remove sulfur from higher-sulfur crude.    US refiners have an advantage over Asian and European competitors in this situation due to the much lower natural gas prices in America. Although the US Henry Hub benchmark price has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, American natural gas prices are around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) compared to $25-$35/mmBtu in equivalent prices in Europe and Asia.  Also on rt.com China urges gas importers to secure supplies at any cost to avoid energy crunch this winter In recent weeks, costs for oil refiners to produce hydrogen per barrel of processed crude have jumped tenfold compared to the hydrogen input costs back in 2019, according to estimates in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) latest monthly oil report cited by Argus. Hydrogen costs are now around $6 per barrel of processed crude, compared to just $0.60 per barrel in 2019. Yet, due to low inventories of refined products globally, refining margins recovered strongly in the third quarter despite the rallying crude oil prices.  Recovering fuel demand and additional demand for oil products amid record-high coal and natural gas prices have pushed up global oil refining margins to their pre-pandemic levels.   “Implied 3Q21 refined product balances show the largest draw in eight years, which explains the strong increase in refinery margins in September despite significantly higher crude prices,” the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Also on rt.com Asia is winning the bidding war for natural gas supply Despite the higher demand for oil products this winter, some refiners in Europe and Asia may not be able to ramp up crude throughput because of the surge in natural gas prices. Refiners in Europe have started to recalibrate their refined product slates to limit exposure to the high costs of natural gas, which is essential for making hydrogen for treating the higher-sulfur crude grades.  “We are impacted by the current high energy prices just like any other consumer of natural gas and electric power,” a spokeswoman for northwest European refiner Varo Energy—whose shareholders include commodity trading giant Vitol—told Reuters. “To ensure we can continue to supply our customers, we have adjusted our operations to minimize our natural gas consumption whilst preserving our ability to supply products,” the spokeswoman added.  Read more India to stockpile gas & coal to avoid future energy crunch “If you’re in Europe or Asia it’s very, very expensive so it’s bound to have an impact,” Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec Plc, told Bloomberg, commenting on natural gas costs.   For US refiners, the costs are also up, but not so much as in Europe and Asia.  For example, Valero Energy, which reported on Thursday a net income for Q3 compared to a loss for the same quarter last year, said that its refining cash operating expenses were $0.27 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas prices.  “When you look at places around the world that are paying $30 a million Btu for natural gas, it pressures that refining capacity and kind of raises the incremental crack spreads needed for them to run, which also pushes margins higher,” Gary Simmons, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Valero, said on the earnings call.   Thanks to lower natural gas prices in the US compared to Europe and Asia, refiners in America will not be as constrained in processing higher-sulfur crudes as their peers in other regions. The higher-sulfur grades have recently seen widening discounts to sweeter crudes, which additionally benefits refining margins for those capable of processing high-sulfur grades due to lower-cost input crude.  In light of these developments, additional volumes of sweeter and lighter crudes could be available for exports from America to Asia and Europe, US traders told Bloomberg.  This article was originally published on Oilprice.com",

    "full_description": "Get rich quick(ly). That's what some investors hope to do. And cryptocurrencies offer an avenue to make it happen. Take Shiba Inu ( CRYPTO:SHIB ) , for example. The cryptocurrency has delivered a gain of more than 5,000,000% in less than 15 months. To say that's a staggering return is a huge understatement. However, many traders in other cryptocurrencies have learned the hard way that what goes up can come down. I suspect that buyers of Shiba Inu at current prices could learn the same lesson. There are much less risky ways to make a lot of money for long-term investors. Here are three unstoppable stocks that are better buys than Shiba Inu. Image source: Getty Images. 1. MercadoLibre Real-world utility, or the lack thereof, is arguably the biggest knock against Shiba Inu. You can't make the same case against MercadoLibre ( NASDAQ:MELI ) . This Latin American company is loaded to the gills with real-world utility. MercadoLibre is best known for its e-commerce platform. And for good reason. The company's quarterly net revenue from e-commerce topped $1 billion for the first time ever in Q2, more than doubling year over year on a constant-currency basis. Yet MercadoLibre is only scratching the surface of its opportunity. Morgan Stanley expects e-commerce market penetration in Latin America to double by 2025. The market could expand more than sixfold over the next few decades. The biggest likely beneficiary of this growth? You guessed it -- MercadoLibre. But MercadoLibres isn't just an e-commerce stock; it's also a fintech stock . The company's Mercado Pago business continues to fire on all cylinders. The underdeveloped financial system in Latin America gives the company's digital wallet an enormous potential market. MercadoLibre's shares should have nowhere to go but up over the long run. 2. MongoDB MongoDB ( NASDAQ:MDB ) stands out as another unstoppable stock with a lot of room to run. The same argument for real-world utility made for MercadoLibre also applies to MongoDB. Every action you take online creates data. That data has to be stored somewhere. In today's world, that somewhere is increasingly in the cloud. And no database provider handles cloud data storage as well as MongoDB. The company's Atlas cloud-based platform is its primary growth driver. MongoDB reported Atlas sales soared 83% year over year in Q2 and now makes up 56% of its total revenue. Can that remarkable momentum continue? Yep. Atlas enables organizations to develop software faster and with the ability to scale up or down quickly as needed. That's a competitive advantage that should enable MongoDB to keep growing rapidly for years to come. 3. Intuitive Surgical There's another challenge for Shiba Inu that shouldn't be overlooked: It has no moat. There are plenty of other cryptocurrencies that could grab center stage. By comparison, one of the best reasons to buy shares of Intuitive Surgical ( NASDAQ:ISRG ) is because of its strong moat. Intuitive pioneered the use of robotic surgical systems more than two decades ago. Today, the company's install base stands at more than 6,500 systems. While Intuitive has potential rivals, none of them can come close to matching its track record and market position. In addition to this strong moat, Intuitive also has exceptional growth prospects. The company estimates that around 6 million procedures are performed each year in markets where it already has regulatory clearances. That's roughly four times greater than the number of procedures for which its robotic systems were used in 2020. Even better, Intuitive continues to invest in research and development to expand into other procedure types. It believes these efforts could expand the addressable number of procedures to around 20 million. You might not get rich quickly investing in Intuitive Surgical, but there's a really good chance that you'll make a lot of money over the next decade and beyond with this stock.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Paulo Dybala bagged a penalty v Inter on Sunday night. Anadolu Agency via Getty Images At first glance, earning a 1-1 draw away to Inter is a good result for Juventus. For the biggest matches, San Siro becomes a cauldron, and while the visitors had made huge improvements to their defence in recent weeks, the Nerazzurri went into this game boasting Serie A’s most prolific attack. That reflects the changes at the club as they move into the Simone Inzaghi era. Inter have become a vastly different side to the one that won the title under Antonio Conte last season, much more expensive going forward but increasingly vulnerable at the back. They were the meanest defence in the league last term after conceding just 35 times in 38 games, but after beating Genoa 4-0 on the opening day of 2021/22, they have allowed every other opponent to find the back of the net. All of which makes Juve’s approach much more difficult to understand. Max Allegri would have prepared for this game fully aware of the changes Inzaghi had made, yet – rather than seeking to exploit them – he opted for caution. If it was understandable to see Paulo Dybala only given a place on the bench after recovering from injury, it was inexplicable that Federico Chiesa was sat there alongside him. This was a game, and an opponent, that would surely have been exposed by the direct running and sheer speed of the Fiorentina man. Yet perhaps even more baffling was the trio of players Allegri started in midfield where, rather than playing Manuel Locatelli in a role where he could attack the opposition, he was forced to anchor the centre of the pitch.

Marcelo Brozovic sits in the middle and pins the Nerazzurri together perfectly. According to WhoScored.com , the Croatia international registered three tackles, one interception and completed 91.8% of his passes. His smart play once again allowed his team-mates to flourish, while continuing to make the €8 million ($9.3m) Inter paid for him in January 2015 look like an incredible piece of business. The figures might be much higher, but the same can be said of the €37 million ($43.1m) given to Cagliari for Nicolò Barella two years ago. He was once again a bundle of energy here, pressing Juve in the relentless fashion that made him a Conte favourite, as he never allowed Juve’s players to feel comfortable in possession. Hakan Calhanoglu and Nicolo Barella are part of a superbly balanced Inter midfield. Getty Images Meanwhile, Hakan Calhanoglu not only created four scoring chances for his team-mates, but statistics taken from Who Scored show he also put in plenty of effort defensively too, weighing in with three tackles and an interception. On the opposite side, if Locatelli was subdued by playing out of position, it certainly didn’t help the rest of the team to flourish. Bernardeschi left after 17 minutes in which he’d made three passes and lost possession once, and the man who replaced him didn’t improve the situation. Rodrigo Bentancur gave the ball away twice, committed a string of unnecessary fouls and contributed precious little to the Juve attack. Yet he was still probably more impactful than McKennie. The US international had one shot (it was off target) and connected with just 21 passes in the 82 minutes that he was on the field, adding to Juve’s problems by turning the ball over three times. It was also his responsibility to close down Calhanoglu in the 17th minute, but instead he stood off and watched as the Turkish star rifled a shot off the crossbar which Edin Dzeko steered home to break the deadlock. In their post-match player ratings , La Gazzetta dello Sport gave McKennie the lowest score of any player on the pitch with just 5, noting that he “played the same position as Barella, but what a difference.” Having started off his Juve career so brightly last season, this was another woefully subpar performance from the 23-year-old and one which leaves Allegri once again seeking solutions in midfield. While there is no doubting his credentials or the success he has enjoyed throughout his career, the Juve boss was undeniably guilty of playing into Inter’s hands on Sunday. If you asked Simone Inzaghi how he’d like Juve to set up, benching Chiesa and hindering Locatelli would arguably have been his first two suggestions. It doesn’t take a tactical genius to see that – particularly against the toughest opponents – any game plan should start with having that duo in positions where they can cause the most damage. November is looking like a tough month with Champions League matches against FC Zenit and Chelsea, as well as tough Serie A clashes with Atalanta, Fiorentina and Lazio. Already 10 points behind the league leaders, Juventus need to stop helping their opponents and start playing to their own strengths.",

Since most online brokerages have eliminated commissions and minimum deposit requirements, even $50 can go a long way to furthering your journey to financial independence. Image source: Getty Images. If you have $50 ready to invest, which won't be needed to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, you have more than enough to buy into the following trio of no-brainer stocks right now. Skillz The first no-brainer stock patient investors can buy right now with $50 is mobile gaming platform company Skillz ( NYSE:SKLZ ) . Shares of Skillz have lost more than three-quarters of their value since peaking in early February. I know what you might be thinking, and you're correct: The gaming industry is highly competitive and offers no assurances that developed games will be a success. What makes Skillz such an intriguing company is that it's avoided the costly development side of the equation and focused its efforts on being a platform where gamers can compete against each other for cash prizes. Since it's considerably cheaper to operate and maintain a middleman gaming platform than it is to develop mobile games, Skillz has consistently cleared a 95% gross margin. Something else that should intrigue investors about Skillz is the company's pay-to-play conversion rate. Industrywide, only around 2% of gamers are converted to paying members. Meanwhile, in the March-ended quarter, Skillz notes that 17% of its monthly active users were paying to play on its platform. If the company can maintain a conversion rate that's many multiples higher than the industry average, it shouldn't have any trouble eventually generating juicy operating margins. Partnerships offer another pathway for Skillz to shine. For instance, the company signed a multiyear agreement with the National Football League (NFL) in February. This deal allows developers to create NFL-themed games that'll run on the company's platform as early as next year. As a reminder, football is the most-popular sport in the United States. Over the next couple of quarters, it would not be a surprise for higher marketing costs and rising headcount to weigh on the company's bottom line. But with all of its puzzle pieces fitting into place, revenue should continue to soar. Within a few years, I suspect investors will be handsomely rewarded for their patience. Image source: Getty Images. Columbia Care Another really smart way to invest $50 right now is to put it to work in the U.S. cannabis industry. Specifically, multistate operator (MSO) Columbia Care ( OTC:CCHWF ) looks ripe for the picking. To state the obvious, the U.S. is where marijuana investors want to put their money to work. Even though global weed revenue is climbing, the U.S. is expected to account for the lion's share of pot sales by mid-decade. Cannabis-focused analytics company BDSA is estimating U.S. weed sales will hit $47.6 billion in 2026, compared to $62.1 billion in worldwide pot revenue. This puts Columbia Care right in the thick of the industry's strongest growth. Marijuana stock Columbia Care has two core strategies that its management team believes will help it succeed. First off, the company has predominantly expanded into limited-license markets . These are legalized states that purposely limit how many retail licenses are issued in total, as well as to a single business. With regulators reining in competition, a company like Columbia Care, which already had a well-established medical presence in a number of top-selling states, is free to further build up its brands for adult-use customers without having to worry about getting trampled by an MSO with deeper pockets. The second, and arguably more important, aspect of the company's growth strategy is its penchant for acquisitions . Columbia Care has made a number of key buyouts since the beginning of 2020 that are designed to quickly expand its reach. On one hand, costs associated with these acquisitions are probably going to weigh on the company's near-term operating results. But beginning in 2022, we should see these deals paying dividends. With Wall Street expecting the company's sales to nearly triple between 2021 and 2024, and the company likely turning the corner to recurring profitability next year, the time to scoop up Columbia Care on the cheap is now. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir Technologies A third no-brainer stock long-term investors can confidently buy right now with $50 is data-mining company Palantir Technologies ( NYSE:PLTR ) . If there's one aspect about Palantir that has the potential to jump out and grab prospective investors, it's the uniqueness of its operating model . There's isn't another company with an artificial intelligence-driven data-mining platform like Palantir. It's likely to see sustainable double-digit sales and bookings growth for many years to come. Palantir is comprised of two core platforms, Gotham and Foundry. Gotham is the company's government-focused platform that aids with military missions and other big-data projects and analyses. Meanwhile Foundry is Palantir's enterprise-directed platform that helps businesses streamline their operations. At the moment, Gotham is Palantir's leading sales contributor. Palantir has had no trouble securing big, multiyear contracts from the U.S. government. These contracts have played a key role in pushing its total remaining deal value across all platforms, as of the end of June, to $3.4 billion. However, Palantir's long-term appeal arguably lies with Foundry . Whereas Gotham's application may be limited for security purposes, there are sea of potential domestic and global businesses that could benefit from a platform that can help them make sense of big data. When Palantir released its prospectus last year, prior to becoming a publicly traded company, it only had 125 companies utilizing Foundry. The runway for growth here is enormous . Although Palantir isn't exactly inexpensive in a strict fundamental sense, it has the sustained growth potential and tools necessary to command a premium.",

    "full_description": "Medicare's fall open enrollment is now in full swing through early December. If you're a current beneficiary, you have a chance to make changes to your coverage for the coming year. Many seniors opt for Medicare Advantage plans as an alternative to original Medicare . If that's the route you've taken, you may not want to keep your current plan for 2022. In fact, here are a few signs that a change may be in order. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Your premiums are high When you sign up for original Medicare, there's a standard Part B premium that applies to all enrollees except for high earners, who are subject to a surcharge. But the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage will hinge on the specific plan you select. And if you're paying a lot right now, it could pay to make a switch. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates that the average Medicare Advantage premium in 2022 will be $19 per month. That's actually a drop from $21.22 a month in 2021. If you're paying a lot more than that, you may want to consider getting a new plan. 2. Your healthcare needs have changed Any time your healthcare needs change, it's a good idea to assess your coverage and make sure it's working for you. The great thing about Medicare Advantage is that many plans offer supplemental benefits that could help cater to a host of medical conditions. And if your current plan doesn't offer the ones you want or need, then it's smart to look at other options. Say you're diagnosed with diabetes. Based on that, you may be eligible for certain benefits under a new Advantage plan, like meal delivery. In that case, a switch would make sense. 3. It's been a struggle to find in-network providers When you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan, you're limited to a specific network of providers. Going out of network could leave you liable for hefty costs you can't easily cover. If you've been having a hard time accessing doctors or pharmacies within your network, then it may be time to switch to a new Advantage plan. A different plan might give you more choices, or choices that are more convenient. 4. You're being charged a fortune for your medications The cost of your medications will hinge on the coverage your Advantage plan offers. If you're paying a lot of money for the prescriptions you take, see if another Advantage plan will charge less for them. Time to make a move? There are plenty of good reasons to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan over original Medicare. But if these things apply to you, it could be time to swap your current Advantage plan for a new one. Any changes you make during fall open enrollment will take effect at the start of 2022. But here's some good news -- if you select an Advantage plan you end up not liking, you'll have an opportunity to drop it and find a different one between January 1 and March 31. You can even sign up for original Medicare during that window if you get fed up with Medicare Advantage altogether. Still, it pays to do plenty of research over the next number of weeks. A little effort on your part could make your healthcare costs far more manageable in the coming year.",

[+] Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Truist Park on Saturday, Oct. 16, 2021 in Atlanta, GA.(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Atlanta Braves officials keep ruining a perfectly wonderful story, and they’re doing so with all of that other stuff. I mean, why? Why Travis Tritt? Why the chopping and the chanting? Why move closer to embarrassment on national television at the end of the week courtesy of those things and whatever other self-inflicted horrors you might have for yourselves around Halloween? Why can’t Braves officials let everybody enjoy the reasons this franchise has one of the most amazing teams ever to win a pennant as the Braves prepare to open the World Series Tuesday night in Houston against the Astros? Regarding the Braves’ miracle in progress: They’ve played all season without their No. 1 starting pitcher (Mike Soroka) after his Achilles tendon issues. They’ve been without their cleanup hitter since late May (left fielder Marcell Ozuna) due to his legal matter involving domestic violence. Their starting catcher (Travis d’Arnaud) didn’t return until early August after he missed three months with a sprained thumb. Their best player (right fielder Ronald Acuna) was also among the elite of the elite in Major League Baseball, and he missed the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in early July. Acuna, Ozuna and d’Arnaud were 2020 National League Silver Slugger winners, meaning they were the best hitters at their position. Without that trio, the Braves never broke .500 for the season until early August, but management made six deals around the July 31 trade deadline to help the Braves win the NL East for the fourth consecutive year. Then they handled the favored Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Division Series.

ATLANTA, GEORGIA - OCTOBER 23: Freddie Freeman #5 of the Atlanta Braves celebrates after defeating ... [+] the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game Six of the National League Championship Series at Truist Park on October 23, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia. The Braves defeated the Dodgers 4-2 to advance to the 2021 World Series. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) Getty Images Here’s proof of the Braves’ amnesia: They spent last week going up 2-0 and 3-1 in the NLCS against the Dodgers (sound familiar), but this time, the Braves clinched their first World Series berth since 1999 Saturday night at Truist Park in Atlanta with a 4-2 victory during Game 6. Vocal anti-vaxxer Tritt sang the national anthem, though. Then came enough chopping and chanting before, during and after the game to make you think John Wayne had risen from the dead to lead a fake cavalry against a fake group of Native Americans before movie cameras. So . . . why? If you’re in charge of the Braves, and if you want as many folks as possible in the highly diverse city of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birth to spend money in the $1.1 billion village you built four years ago called The Battery — featuring Truist Park, restaurants, shops and other things designed to produce revenue for the franchise — you don’t hint you’re more into elephants (Republicans) than donkeys (Democrats). Figuratively speaking, you choose giraffes or some other kind of animal. Which means you avoid suggesting you prefer a certain political party. Which means you don’t remind the rest of the nation you joined your Republican governor, Brian Kemp, in ripping Major League Baseball officials for removing the All-Star Game from your ballpark this summer after Kemp and his Republican colleagues in the Georgia state legislature approved a restrictive and racist voting law. In other words, you would think Braves officials would leave Tritt alone. This is the same Tritt who spent the last few days cancelling performances in states that want their citizens at such events to show proof of vaccination while adhering to other COVID-19 safety measures. With The Battery in mind, you would think Braves officials would do everything possible to make their brand appealing to more than just right-wing zealots represented by the likes of Tritt and Kemp. Then again, you would think Braves officials would join nearly every Little League, high school, college and pro team not named the Chicago Blackhawks, Kansas City Chiefs or Florida State Seminoles in refusing to do anything that might seem offensive to an ethnic group. Oh, well. Actually . . . Ohhhhhhhhhhhh Ohh, Ohhhhhh Ohhhhhh Oh Ohhhhhhhhhhhh Braves fans still are chopping and chanting. That’s because Braves officials still encourage as much during games. They blast a drumbeat over Truist Park’s public address system while a computerized tomahawk goes up and down on ballpark video screens. Not only that, but Braves officials still refuse to answer questions from the media about the chopping and chanting — despite, for instance, The Washington Football Team changing its name from Redskins and the Cleveland Indians becoming “Guardians” next year. So, when Games 3, 4 and possibly 5 of the best-of-seven World Series come this weekend to Truist Park, that national television audience will see a bunch of folks in the stands functioning as if the 19th century lives. For Braves officials and their fans, it does.",

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - 2022 Bajaj Dominar 400 gets standard accessory upgrades in the form of a tall windscreen, handguard, bash plate with integrated metal skid plate, etc Bajaj Auto has today announced the launch of the new Dominar 400 with touring accessories right out of the factory to enhance its touring capabilities and is priced at Rs. 2.17 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi). It comes with an angular tall windshield developed using CFD technology. It is designed to offer good wind-blast protection and thus improve rider comfort according to the brand. The Chakan-based manufacturer says the jet fighter inspired handguard with flexi-winglets offers maximum wind protection and is aerodynamically sculpted. A luggage carrier and a back stopper are other additions as part of the accessory kit along with a new engine bash plate with an integrated metal skid plate for better impact protection. The new leg guard is said to offer superior crash protection and the saddle stay further enhances the practicality of the sports tourer as it helps in securing saddlebags in place. A neatly integrated cast aluminium-built navigation stay allows riders to attach a navigation device and is positioned in such a way to avoid blocking the road view. A USB charging port has also been introduced. Except for the touring accessories, no changes have been made as the performance continues to be derived from a 373.3 cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled DOHC fuel-injected engine developing a maximum power output of 40 PS and 35 Nm of peak torque. It is paired with a six-speed transmission. Speaking on the launch, Narayan Sundararaman – Head of Marketing, Bajaj Auto Ltd., said “Dominar 400 has been able to create a strong following for itself and has become the preferred choice for city riders and long-distance tourers, alike. Customers have pushed the bike into long distances and challenging geographies with aplomb, which inspired us to strengthen the sports tourer credentials in the new Dominar.” The 2022 Bajaj Dominar 400 is suspended on 43 mm USD front forks and monoshock rear suspension and is sold in Aurora Green and Charcoal Black colour schemes. It is equipped with front and rear disc brakes assisted by a dual-channel ABS system, dual barrel exhaust system, and all-digital instrumentation. Except for saddle stay, all other accessories are standard.   The post 2022 Bajaj Dominar 400 Launched In India At Rs. 2.17 Lakh appeared first on Gaadiwaadi.com - Latest Car & Bike News by Surendhar M.",

    "full_description": "Pop quiz! What's your full retirement age for Social Security? How much money might you expect to collect from Social Security? Many people can't answer these questions, and that's not good, because Social Security income is likely to be critical to them in retirement. Indeed, it represents about 30% of the average elderly person's income. Here are five questions you need to be able to answer in order to make smart Social Security decisions. Image source: Getty Images. 1. What's my full retirement age? Each of us, in the eyes of the Social Security Administration (SSA) has a \" full retirement age \" (FRA) -- the age at which we can start collecting the full benefits to which we're entitled, based on our earnings records. For most of us, that age is 66 or 67 -- or somewhere in between. Our FRA is important because it's not just at that age that we can start collecting benefits -- we can actually start as early as age 62 and as late as age 70. And depending on when we choose to start, we will end up receiving more or less than what we'd get at our FRA. 2. How much can I expect to collect at my full retirement age? So what would you receive at your FRA? Well, the sum varies, as it's based on our earnings record, and each of us has had a different working life, with different earnings. But for some context, know that recently the average monthly Social Security benefit was $1,559 -- or about $18,700 per year. That certainly may not seem like much, but if you earned more than the average over your working life, your benefits will be above average, too. They'll top out at $3,895 per month (as of 2021), though. For a more precise estimate of how much Social Security income you can expect, visit the SSA website and set up a \" my Social Security \" account. Then you can click over to the SSA website anytime and access the latest estimates of your future benefits. Note that the estimates are based on the latest earnings information the SSA has -- you can check out that information at the site, too. If you spot any errors, look into having them fixed -- that alone might increase your future benefits. 3. When should I start collecting my benefits? So... when should you start collecting if you can start as early as age 62? Many people do start at age 62, often because they have little choice; some have been laid off and others are not healthy enough to work. Starting early means your checks will be smaller -- but you'll receive more of them, so it's not necessarily a money-losing move. Delaying as late as age 70 will make your checks bigger -- but again, you'll receive fewer. Delaying can be great if you can delay and if you stand a decent chance of living longer than average. The table below shows the approximate percentage of your full benefits that you'll receive, depending on when you start collecting: Age You Start Collecting Full Retirement Age of 66 Full Retirement Age of 67 62 75% 70% 63 80% 75% 64 86.7% 80% 65 93.3% 86.7% 66 100% 93.3% 67 108% 100% 68 116% 108% 69 124% 116% 70 132% 124% Source: Social Security Administration. When deciding when to start collecting your benefits, be sure to consider your big retirement picture. If you think you'll start collecting at 62, will you stop working then? Will you have sufficient income on which to live? Many people will need to keep working longer than they'd like -- possibly even until age 70. Image source: Getty Images. 4. Should I coordinate with my spouse? Next, if you're married, a little coordination with your spouse can end up bringing more Social Security dollars into your household over the long term, and may make a huge difference to the lower-earner between you. That's because when one spouse dies, the survivor is allowed to receive either Social Security benefit check -- their own or their late partner's -- whichever is bigger. So the higher earner might want to try to delay starting to collect, in order to build up that bigger benefit further. 5. Have I considered taxes? Be sure to learn a little about Social Security and taxes, too, because Social Security benefits can be taxed . Specifically, up to 85% of your benefits can be taxed. It all depends on your \"combined income,\" which is your adjusted gross income (\"AGI\"), plus non-taxable interest, plus half of your Social Security benefits. The following table shows the thresholds for taxation: Filing as Combined Income Percentage of Taxable Benefits Single individual Between $25,000 and $34,000 Up to 50% Married, filing jointly Between $32,000 and $44,000 Up to 50% Single individual More than $34,000 Up to 85% Married, filing jointly More than $44,000 Up to 85% Source: Social Security Administration. It's not as bad as it may seem to you, because it doesn't mean that you'll face a tax rate of 50% or 85% on your benefits -- those numbers refer to the portion of your benefits that would count as taxable income. Some states also tax Social Security benefits -- 13 states recently did , while 37 states didn't . This isn't necessarily terrible, either, because even if your state does tax benefits, it may have a low tax rate or may only tax those with high incomes. Learn your states details before despairing. There's also the matter of withholding. If you are still working while collecting your Social Security benefits, the SSA may hold back some of your benefits. Here's how it has explained it: \"If you're younger than full retirement age during all of 2021, we must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn above $18,960. If you reach full retirement age during 2021, we must deduct $1 from your benefits for each $3 you earn above $50,520 until the month you reach full retirement age.\" Don't worry too much about this, though, because what's deducted is not forfeited -- you'll just get it later. As the SSA explains, \"If some of your retirement benefits are withheld because of your earnings, your monthly benefit will increase starting at your full retirement age to take into account those months in which benefits were withheld.\" Being able to answer the five questions above can go a long way to making you Social Security-savvy and able to get more out of the program than you otherwise would have. You might also want to learn more about other ways to increase your benefits . The more you know, the more comfortable your retirement is likely to be.",

    "full_description": "Disneyland and neighboring California Adventure Park raised most daily ticket prices Monday and are adopting an even higher price to visit on the most popular days of the year, such as Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Daily ticket prices are jumping 3% to 8%, with standard daily parking rates going up by 20%. The parks last raised ticket prices by as much as 5% in February of 2020 — shortly before the parks closed for 13 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To manage crowds, the park adopted a five-tiered pricing scheme in 2016 that charges more for days when demand is highest and less on slow days. The price for lowest demand days — such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays in late January — remains unchanged at $104. But prices have increased for the four other tiers, and the resort added a highest-price sixth tier, $164 for a one-day visit to a single park on the highest demand days of the year, including select weekends, holidays and spring break. The previous highest one-day, one-park ticket was $154. Business Wait times at Disneyland and Universal Studios are way down. Here’s why Good news for theme park fans: Wait times have dropped at Disneyland and California Adventure Park compared with before the pandemic. The prices are the same for visiting Disneyland and neighboring Disney California Adventure Park. The prices for tickets that let you visit two parks in one day — Park Hopper — are increasing by as much as 7%. The inflation rate in the U.S. was 5.4% for the 12 months that ended in September. The price increases come despite several popular attractions at the parks remaining shut since the parks reopened in April from the pandemic closure, a complaint that theme park fans have voiced often on social media . The nightly fireworks show, water-and-light displays such as Fantasmic and World of Color and most daily costumed parades have yet to return to the parks. Higher costs may turn away some Disney fans upset that they are being charged more for fewer attractions, but the price hike is likely to generate more revenue overall for Walt Disney Co. even with a slight drop in attendance, said Martin Lewison, a business administration professor and theme park expert at Farmingdale State College in New York. “I think many guests will find this a very bitter pill at this point in time,” he said. “But it wouldn’t be the end of the world for the company if attendance dipped a little bit.” Disneyland representatives noted that California Adventure Park added a six-acre Marvel superhero-themed land — called Avengers Campus — in June and the resort plans to launch several holiday attractions, including a new Christmas-themed parade. Since reopening, Disney has launched a handful of new efforts to address the theme park’s biggest headaches — long ride queues and crowded parks. Business Disneyland reveals which COVID-era changes will stay, which will go Disneyland and Disney California Adventure have lifted rules about crowds and distancing. Fireworks are coming back. But some changes will stick. In August, Disney overhauled its 37-year-old annual pass program, replacing it with a new Magic Key program that requires visitors to make reservations before going to the theme parks, while continuing to block out access on the busiest days. By requiring reservations, the new program enables Disney park operators to better manage crowds on a day-to-day basis. The Magic Key passes are generally priced lower than the previous annual passes and include four options, ranging in price from $399 per year for Southern California residents to $1,399 for the option that has no blocked-out days and the greatest flexibility for making reservations. Longtime annual pass holders have complained about the Magic Key program, saying the reservation system makes it too difficult to visit the parks on high-demand days, even for those with the most expensive pass. The resort’s reservation calendar shows that no reservations are available for nearly every weekend over the next two months, but that can change as Disney has occasionally opened up reservations. Business Disneyland has a new annual pass program. Here’s everything you need to know The new Disneyland Magic Key annual pass program, on sale starting Aug. 25, will require reservations, a change aimed at quelling overcrowding at the parks. A few weeks after the Magic Key program was launched, Disney adopted a new mobile app that allows parkgoers willing to pay extra to skip the wait for the most popular attractions. The new app — known as the Disney Genie — replaced two older systems at Disneyland — the free FastPass and the MaxPass, which cost $20 per day — that let parkgoers reserve a time slot for an attraction to avoid the traditional queues and instead zip into an expedited Fastpass Lane. Disney Genie is a free app that recommends a visit itinerary based on the attractions, shows and eateries chosen by users at the start of the day. Disney Genie+ is a similar app that costs $20 per day at Disneyland and can be used to make reservations to get on a ride at a specific time, skipping the traditional queues and giving access instead to a new Lightning Lane. Disneyland will operate more than 15 attractions with Lightning Lanes, and the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida will include more than 40 attractions with Lightning Lanes. Users can make only one reservation at a time. But to skip the lines on the most popular attractions, such as as Radiator Springs Racers at Disney California Adventure and Rise of the Resistance at Disneyland, park visitors will have to pay a separate fee that will vary based on the date, the attraction and the park. The exact price won’t be announced for several weeks, Disney representatives say. Business Disneyland to launch Genie app with new fees to skip the long lines Disney announced plans for a new mobile app that will allow parkgoers, for an extra fee, to skip the wait for the most popular attractions. During a recent earnings report, Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief executive, said reservations for the company’s domestic theme parks remain strong. “We’ve implemented a reservation system that’s going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield, and improve our guest experience at the same time,” he said.",

    "content": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When inflation started to rise earlier this year, many central bankers were quick to call it “transitory,” asserting that it would dissipate soon. Over the course of 2021, however, neither the quantitative forecasts nor the arguments cited in support of this hypothesis have held up. Yet, in stark contrast with the mindset of corporate leaders who are dealing daily with the reality of higher and persistent inflationary pressures, the transitory concept has managed to retain an almost mystical hold on the thinking of many policy makers. The longer this persists, the greater the risk of a historic policy error whose negative implications could last for years and extend well beyond the U.S.Continue Reading.

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - Here are my impressions of the Royal Enfield Continental GT-R650, the race-spec GT competing in the Continental GT Cup, from Kari Motor Speedway After a lengthy run of success in the Indian racing scenes in the good old past, Royal Enfield has made a comeback to tarmac racing with one of its iconic nameplates the Continental GT. The Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup runs across four race weekends with the first three rounds in Kari Motor Speedway, Coimbatore and the finale at Buddh International Circuit. With the first round in the books, we got to witness a thrilling couple of races around the winding and technical racetrack as eighteen racers fought it out for the top step of the podium. The race one had an almost photo finish as the racers pushed their limits to bring out the best in them and the Continental GT-R650 tussling through every corner and the straights. Royal Enfield filtered out 18 racers from 400 applicants across India based on their lap times and consistency by evaluating them over five laps around KMS. We put our leg around the race-spec Continental GT 650 for a good amount of time and came out mightily impressed. Firstly, the stock Conti has been through minimalistic changes but the transformation in its riding behaviour is rather substantial on the circuit. For improved aero stability, RE has fitted the standard cafe racer a Monza fairing and it evokes the vintage vibe. The tall windscreen helps in tucking in for aerodynamic benefits and the low-set clip-on handlebar has further been lowered to give a more aggressive track riding stance. It is supported by the further rearward set footpegs that increase cornering ground clearance as well. The Gabriel-sourced front telescopic suspension gets pre-load adjustability for fined tuned setup based on rider preference and the oil used is specifically designed for track use. The dual shock absorbers at the rear get linear springs as opposed to progressive springs for improved responsiveness on track. The Chennai-based manufacturer made no changes to the ECU or the powertrain but the same 648 cc parallel twin-cylinder engine produces slightly higher power (47 PS and 52 Nm of peak torque) courtesy of the full system stainless Steel exhaust. The powertrain is paired with a six-speed transmission as the regular model. With no electronic aids, the ABS system is turned off and the brakes are also stock as the bybre unit with 320 mm front disc and 240 mm rear disc units continue to be utilised. RE has managed to shed 24 kilograms in the GT-R650 and the results are more than evident while the sprockets have reduced toothing for better acceleration. The Ceat tyres are ditched in favour of stickier soft compound tyres as well and its superlative performance makes us wish it was on the stock motorcycle already. As I straddled, I immediately noticed the need to acclimatise to the more aggressive clip ons and footpegs and as soon as I did that the confidence came flying in as I managed to brake late into the corners and took the exits cleanly. The dual exhaust pipes definitely sing a rhythm of petrolheads while opening the throttle and at three-digit speeds down the pit straight. The tricky final part of the track makes or breaks lap times and the heavy double-cradle chassis had to be worked out with wider turn-ins to get the maximum out of the motorcycle and it renders a planted feel throughout. The rear shocks could have been firmer to my liking but the front telescopic forks managed the weight transfer quite well especially in the hard braking areas (like scrubbing off the speeds for turn 1 left-hander) and quick braking needs to enhance the intuitive feel. The bumpiness of the track is challenging and for a long Wheelbase motorcycle like the GT-R650, you would be a handful all the time. The sharper acceleration and increased lean angle certainly made the difference on track as higher speeds could be carried in and out of the loops. The standard Continental GT 650 could be turned into this mean machine without emptying your pocket and it’s the big takeaway for anyone wanting to do open sessions on track and learn the faster way forwards the proper way. RE will also set up racing schools to take this to the next level and the GT-R650 has plenty of potential to go even faster as a race machine with improvements over time and hopefully, the learnings from the racetrack will be applied onto the production bikes for people to buy just as how it used to be in the past!

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — Employees Provident Fund (EPF) members using the i-Invest self-service online investment facility can now purchase up to eight unit trust funds from a maximum of five fund management institutions (FMIs) in a single purchase transaction.EPF said previously, members could only purchase multiple unit trust funds from one FMI in a single transaction.“This enhanced feature for i-Invest allows members better access and efficiency when investing through the facility,” it said in a statement today.However, it said these transactions could only be conducted through appointed Institutional Unit Trust Scheme Advisers (IUTAs) that offered funds from various FMIs.It said EPF members might still purchase funds from individual FMIs if they choose to do so.Additionally, it said i-Invest users would now be required to perform an investment suitability assessment before conducting any transaction and the assessment would profile members’ risk tolerances, enabling them to make informed investment choices suited to their investment risk appetites.The retirement fund said the EPF’s i-Invest facility, which was launched in August 2019, is a digitally powered platform that provided greater flexibility, functionality and convenience for EPF members to invest, transact and monitor their unit trust investments anytime and anywhere.“Through the facility, members are able to compare different unit trust funds offered by FMIs, obtain a consolidated view of their investment holdings and information on cost of investment, historical fund performance as well as required statutory information,” it said.It added that as a self-service facility that empowered members to take charge of their financial future, the EPF ensured governance guidelines within i-Invest are complied with stringently by participating bodies. — Bernama",

(Photo by OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images It was after an hour of this historically humiliating defeat to Liverpool that thousands of Manchester United fans decided they could take no more. An aerial shot of Old Trafford showed hordes of them streaming out of the ground and making their way home early along Sir Matt Busby Way. At this point their side was losing 5-0 and it would stay like that to hand Liverpool their biggest win over United for nearly a century. Liverpool fans savoured every moment and serenaded these departing fans with ironic chants of “Ole is at the wheel,” and “Ole must stay.” Down below them the embattled United manager ignored the Liverpool fans’ further requests to give them a wave as he stared out on to the pitch.

It was a shambolic and devastating experience for Solskjaer, and it is difficult to see how the Norwegian survives for too much longer in his job. However, the word from inside Old Trafford remains that Solskjaer is under no pressure and he will not be sacked in the coming days.

(Photo by OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images It began with the false optimism of their opening day 5-1 demolition of Leeds United, followed by the excitement of Cristiano Ronaldo’s signing and his second debut against Newcastle United when United recorded a 4-1 win. Since United beat West Ham at the end of September they have taken just a single point from their next four league games. There was always a creeping fear United would be exposed when they played a team from the top six, and this is exactly what happened against Liverpool. The most damning part of this defeat is Jurgen Klopp’s men strolled to their 5-0 victory without even playing that well. They scored their fifth goal after 49 minutes, and then saw out the last 41 minutes of the game without wishing to trouble United again. A highly motivated and organised group of players had simply taken advantage of United lacking these same qualities.

[+] Manchester United at the end the Premier League match between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford on October 24, 2021 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images) Liverpool FC via Getty Images Liverpool made 645 successful passes while United made less than half that with 321 as they struggled to play with any obvious plan or structure. United dithered in defence, went missing in midfield and offered almost nothing in attack. They were a mess and made a host of basic errors; their players easily pulled out of position, failing to track back or close down their opponents. Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire looked like shadows of the world-class players they appeared to be only a matter of months ago at Euro 2020 as Liverpool, and particularly Mo Salah feasted on their indecision. This will be a long and uncomfortable week for Solskjaer before his side travel to London to face Tottenham next Saturday. He will be looking for answers, some glimmers of hope, but at the present moment there are precious few of them.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin aespa at ‘Savage’ Online Press Conference in Seoul, South Korea Courtesy of SM Entertainment With the global K-pop scene more competitive than ever, aespa have made sure to double down on the details that make their experimental music and complex worldview stand out from rivals—with audiences around the world latching on in major ways. The girl group kicked off their musical story in late 2020 with their surging electro-pop debut single “Black Mamba” (that went on to break YouTube records for new K-pop groups ) and have quickly become known for experimental-yet-addictive hybrids of today’s hip-hop and pop trends like the impressive genre- and tempo-jumping “Next Level” and their latest clanging banger “Savage.” That sound has become the backdrop to unraveling aespa’s larger story as part of the SM Culture Universe (SMCU), which represents a shared space and universe produced by SM Entertainment AMC that incorporates elements of the Korean superlabel’s artists and other creative IP. So far, aespa’s world includes the group’s four members (Karina, Winter, Giselle and Ningning), their virtual avatars known as æ (that made an appearance on U.S. television during a performance of “Savage” on The Kelly Clarkson Show ), and the antagonist Black Mamba (a threat to the entire aespa world who can disrupt the connection between the real world and virtual reality). MORE FROM FORBES Aespa Break Out Among New K-Pop Acts With 100 Million Views On Debut Music Video By Jeff Benjamin “One of the biggest elements that characterize our music and make it unique and experimental is our worldview and the SMCU concept,” the group says while reflecting on how they prepare for these multifaceted releases. “Our previous singles ‘Black Mamba’ and ‘Next Level’, as well as the newly released ‘Savage,’ are all connected to one story surrounding our worldview like a movie series...through our music and performances, the story continues and new characters are introduced, further expanding our worldview.” MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge From cinematic sound effects to tempo changes representing shifts in the storytelling, the quartet says atypical song structures and styles in their tracks also come into play when telling the aespa’s tale. “Our music contains this story not only in the lyrics but also in the structure of the song as well,” they add. “The structure is different because it shows the storyline of the aespa worldview and expresses its dramatic elements musically. So, before recording and performing a song, we think about the characters, the stories, and the overall atmosphere like filming a movie. Our title track ‘Savage’ is about confronting the ‘Black Mamba’ so we felt it was important to show a strong and powerful side of us in a nonchalant way that comes from our confidence in facing ‘Black Mamba.’” And as much as aespa aim to highlight the aspects that make them a next-generation girl group, the women also can’t deny the importance of TikTok-ready dance moves to better hook into viewers’ minds. “Apart from the worldview concept, we think it’s important to have that special element, a point choreography or sound, that grab people’s attention, so we spend a lot of time thinking about what that could be,” aespa share. “With our title track ‘Savage,’ our Executive Producer Soo-Man Lee came up with the idea of adding ‘tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk’ [finger wagging] in the chorus and reflecting it in the lyrics as well as the choreography. You say ‘tsk, tsk’ when you are trying to say something along the lines of ‘what a shame’ or ‘you’re no match for me’ and we tried to sing this as a message to ‘Black Mamba’ saying, ‘You’re no match for aespa!’ As you can tell, we paid attention to every little detail of the song and performance to create one-of-a-kind music that gives us our own special identity and color as artists.” With no aspect of their music left unconsidered, aespa have caught on lightning-quick not only in their home of Korea—where “Next Level” slowly rose to become of 2021’s biggest songs and remained at the top of the charts for months—but in America too where their Savage EP debuted at No. 20 on the Billboard 200 chart to mark the best position ever for a female K-pop act’s debut album— beating out acts who have been signed with major U.S. labels. By keeping the ambitious vision of this real and virtual world, no doubt aespa is on its way to carving a new lane that can push boundaries for not just K-pop but musicians at large.",

    "content": "The construction of a bitcoin mega-mining farm in Argentina by Bitfarms is raising concerns for legislators. Martín Berhongaray, a national deputy, recently presented a resolution to force the government to disclose information about the installation of the facility, through representatives from the Ministries of Science, Technology and Innovation, Environment and Sustainable Development, and of the nation’s economy.\r Bitfarms Mega Farm in Sights of Legislators\r The ambitious project that Bitfarms, a mining behemoth headquartered in Canada, is building in Argentina, has already started to raise concerns with Argentinian legislators. Martín Berhongaray, a national deputy, introduced a law proposal for the government to explain how this deal was conceived and whether the company has passed oversight of the different state institutions linked to the deal, like the Ministries of Science, Technology and Innovation, Environment and Sustainable Development, and of the nation’s economy.\r The law proposal requires disclosure related to:\r \r The competent areas in energy, environmental, and economic matters registered the agreement announced by the Canadian company Bitfarms, to source electricity through a Wholesale Electricity Market Agent (MEM) for 8 years.\r \r The mining farm will host 55,000 mining machines, with Bitfarms reportedly establishing a contract with a private power company to receive 210 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure capacity at a rate of 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour.\r \r More Worries\r The proposal seems to be directed at procuring information about the energy facility that will provide the power, and the sustainability of this deal into the future. While the company that is doing the construction has been identified as PROA, the power company and the location of the facility are still a mystery to the public, as it has only been revealed it’s going to be located in a rural area in a recent PR statement.\r These doubts have surely influenced the proposal, which also inquires:\r \r If the total electrical system installed in the country, or imminent installation, has that available capacity. If the consumption of that electrical energy used will receive a subsidy from public funds.\r \r The reason for Bitfarms expanding to Argentina is not a secret. The region offers affordable energy opportunities in certain parts of the country, and this is bringing more and more companies to eye the area as a possible expansion destination. Bitfarms president Geoffrey Morphy concluded:\r \r With considerable low-cost energy available to us for many years, we can improve our short-term margin performance and ensure a viable operation.\r \r What do you think about the Bitfarms bitcoin mega-mining facility being installed in Argentina?

Martín Berhongaray, a national deputy, recently presented a resolution to force the government to disclose information about the installation of the facility, through representatives from the Ministries of Science, Technology and Innovation, Environment and Sustainable Development, and of the nation’s economy. Bitfarms Mega Farm in Sights of Legislators The ambitious project that Bitfarms, a mining behemoth headquartered in Canada, is building in Argentina, has already started to raise concerns with Argentinian legislators. Martín Berhongaray, a national deputy, introduced a law proposal for the government to explain how this deal was conceived and whether the company has passed oversight of the different state institutions linked to the deal, like the Ministries of Science, Technology and Innovation, Environment and Sustainable Development, and of the nation’s economy. The law proposal requires disclosure related to: The competent areas in energy, environmental, and economic matters registered the agreement announced by the Canadian company Bitfarms, to source electricity through a Wholesale Electricity Market Agent (MEM) for 8 years. The mining farm will host 55,000 mining machines, with Bitfarms reportedly establishing a contract with a private power company to receive 210 megawatts (MW) of infrastructure capacity at a rate of 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. More Worries The proposal seems to be directed at procuring information about the energy facility that will provide the power, and the sustainability of this deal into the future. While the company that is doing the construction has been identified as PROA, the power company and the location of the facility are still a mystery to the public, as it has only been revealed it’s going to be located in a rural area in a recent PR statement . These doubts have surely influenced the proposal, which also inquires: If the total electrical system installed in the country, or imminent installation, has that available capacity. If the consumption of that electrical energy used will receive a subsidy from public funds. The reason for Bitfarms expanding to Argentina is not a secret. The region offers affordable energy opportunities in certain parts of the country, and this is bringing more and more companies to eye the area as a possible expansion destination. Bitfarms president Geoffrey Morphy concluded: With considerable low-cost energy available to us for many years, we can improve our short-term margin performance and ensure a viable operation.

    "content": "Oil prices rallied above $86 a barrel on Monday, extending multi-year gains after Saudi Arabia urged the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stick to a cautious approach to raising global output. Global benchmark Brent crude jumped 71 cents, or 0.8%, to $86.24 a barrel, continuing growth after seven consecutive weekly gains. Earlier in the session, Brent price brushed $86.43 a barrel, reaching its highest level since October 2018. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 87 cents, or 1%, to $84.63 a barrel at 3:42am GMT, after 1.5% growth on Friday. It also touched its highest price since 2014 at $84.76 earlier in the day. Also on rt.com Forget $100, options traders now betting on oil prices hitting $200 The rally comes after Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman advised producers not to take the rise in oil prices as a constant, noting that while the situation around the Covid-19 pandemic remains unpredictable, oil demand could soon fall. “We are not yet out of the woods. We need to be careful. The crisis is contained but is not necessarily over,” bin Salman told Bloomberg TV on Saturday. Another OPEC+ member, Nigeria, followed suit, suggesting that the 23-nation cartel must resist pressure to boost oil production until the pandemic backs down. Similar comments also came from Azerbaijan. Also on rt.com The 2021 oil price rally is far from over Oil prices have more than doubled over the past year as the global economy struggles to recover from the pandemic-induced crisis. While energy consumption has surged and storage has run low, OPEC+ decided earlier this year to raise its monthly crude production by 400,000 barrels.

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - The Tata Punch will go on to become the most affordable SUV in the carmaker’s portfolio, and will directly rival the Maruti Suzuki Ignis and the Mahindra KUV100 NXT Tata Motors is all set to reveal the Punch micro SUV on October 4, and the carmaker has certainly managed to create a buzz with all the teasers revealed so far. The exterior and interior of the Punch have already been revealed, while a host of its specifications were also recently leaked online. That said, the specs revealed so far are enough for us to create a detailed comparison between the Tata Punch and two of its closest rivals – the Maruti Suzuki Ignis and Mahindra KUV100 NXT. Here is a specifications comparison between the three, take a look – Dimensions The Tata Punch will measure 3840 mm in length, 1800 mm in width, stand 1635 mm tall and have a 2450 mm long wheelbase. The Maruti Suzuki Ignis has a length of 3700 mm, a width of 1690 mm, a height of 1595 mm and a 2435 mm long wheelbase. The Mahindra KUV100 NXT is 3700 mm long, 1735 mm wide, 1655 mm tall and gets a 2385 mm long wheelbase. Car Tata Punch Maruti Suzuki Ignis Mahindra KUV100 NXT Length 3840 mm 3700 mm 3700 mm Width 1800 mm 1690 mm 1735 mm Height 1635 mm 1595 mm 1655 mm Wheelbase 2450 mm 2435 mm 2385 mm   This means that the Tata Punch is the longest as well as widest out of the three, while the Mahindra KUV100 NXT is the tallest. The Punch also has the longest wheelbase here, and it has been revealed that the car will have a boot space of 336 litres. Powertrains Powering the Tata Punch will be the sole 1.2-litre three-cylinder naturally aspirated Revotron petrol engine that belts out 86 PS of max power and 113 Nm of peak torque. The transmission duties will be taken care of by a 5-speed MT, as well as an optional AMT gearbox. Car Tata Punch Maruti Suzuki Ignis Mahindra KUV100 NXT Engine 1.2-litre 3-cyl NA petrol 1.2-litre 4-cyl NA petrol 1.2-litre 3-cyl NA petrol Power 86 PS 83 PS 83 PS Torque 113 Nm 113 Nm 115 Nm Transmission 5-speed MT, AMT 5-speed MT, AMT 5-speed MT   The Maruti Suzuki Ignis is offered with a 1.2-litre four-cylinder NA petrol engine that makes 83 PS and 113 Nm, and can also be had with a 5-speed manual transmission along with an optional AMT. The KUV100 NXT’s 1.2-litre three-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol motor generates 83 PS power and 115 Nm torque, but is available with a 5-speed manual gearbox only. Features The Punch’s equipment list will likely consist of features like a free-standing touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity, a semi-digital instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch colour display, push start/stop button, 90-degree opening doors, a three-spoke multi-function steering wheel with audio, telephone, and cruise control switches, as well as first-in-class drive modes. The Maruti Suzuki Ignis gets projector headlamps with LED DRLs, puddle lamps, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Maruti’s Smartplay 2.0 integration, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, automatic climate control, a multi-info display with a TFT screen, push button start/stop etc, steering mounted audio and Bluetooth controls and so on. On the other hand, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT comes with features like door handle mood lighting, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, USB and AUX connectivity, Mahindra BLUESENSE app integration, DRLs, micro-hybrid tech, electrically adjustable ORVMs, puddle lamps, cooled glove box, follow-me-home headlamps, boot lamp and so on. Safety We expect the Tata Punch to be equipped with safety features like dual airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, a reverse parking camera, traction modes, hill assist and hill descent control as well. Since the Punch will be based on the same ALFA ARC platform as the Altroz that received a 5-star safety rating in Global NCAP’s crash tests, we expect the micro SUV to offer a similar level of occupant safety. The safety features on offer with the Maruti Suzuki Ignis include rear parking sensors, dual frontal airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat anchorages, seat-belt pre-tensioners and a high-speed alert system. Higher variants also come with a reverse parking camera. Similarly, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT gets ABS with EBD, dual airbags, ISOFIX child seat mounts, speed-sensing auto-door lock, a reverse camera and rear parking sensors as well. Price Maruti Suzuki retails the Ignis at a starting price of Rs 5.10 lakh, that goes up to Rs 7.47 lakh for the top-end trim. On the other hand, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT is priced between Rs 6.08 lakh to Rs 7.74 lakh (all prices, ex-showroom Delhi). While Tata is yet to reveal the Punch’s pricing, we expect it to be launched at an introductory starting price of around Rs 5 lakh, going all the way up to Rs 8 lakh (both prices, ex-showroom Delhi). Comparison Verdict The Maruti Suzuki Ignis’ popularity has grown since its mid-life update last year, and the Japanese carmaker manages to sell the car in decent numbers. However, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT is just holding on for dear life, and barely manages to find any takers in the country. While the companies might claim otherwise, the two cars can simply be classified as tallboy hatchbacks, while the upcoming Tata Punch will also pack some soft-road cred. Tata has previously claimed that the car will ‘Pack a Punch’ on every terrain, and the carmaker aims to achieve a sale of 18,000 – 20,000 units of the car each month. If Tata Motors manages to price the Punch sensibly, it can go on to become the country’s best-selling car.

Features The Punch’s equipment list will likely consist of features like a free-standing touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity, a semi-digital instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch colour display, push start/stop button, 90-degree opening doors, a three-spoke multi-function steering wheel with audio, telephone, and cruise control switches, as well as first-in-class drive modes. The Maruti Suzuki Ignis gets projector headlamps with LED DRLs, puddle lamps, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Maruti’s Smartplay 2.0 integration, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, automatic climate control, a multi-info display with a TFT screen, push button start/stop etc, steering mounted audio and Bluetooth controls and so on. On the other hand, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT comes with features like door handle mood lighting, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, USB and AUX connectivity, Mahindra BLUESENSE app integration, DRLs, micro-hybrid tech, electrically adjustable ORVMs, puddle lamps, cooled glove box, follow-me-home headlamps, boot lamp and so on. Safety We expect the Tata Punch to be equipped with safety features like dual airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, a reverse parking camera, traction modes, hill assist and hill descent control as well. Since the Punch will be based on the same ALFA ARC platform as the Altroz that received a 5-star safety rating in Global NCAP’s crash tests, we expect the micro SUV to offer a similar level of occupant safety. The safety features on offer with the Maruti Suzuki Ignis include rear parking sensors, dual frontal airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat anchorages, seat-belt pre-tensioners and a high-speed alert system. Higher variants also come with a reverse parking camera. Similarly, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT gets ABS with EBD, dual airbags, ISOFIX child seat mounts, speed-sensing auto-door lock, a reverse camera and rear parking sensors as well. Price Maruti Suzuki retails the Ignis at a starting price of Rs 5.10 lakh, that goes up to Rs 7.47 lakh for the top-end trim. On the other hand, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT is priced between Rs 6.08 lakh to Rs 7.74 lakh (all prices, ex-showroom Delhi). While Tata is yet to reveal the Punch’s pricing, we expect it to be launched at an introductory starting price of around Rs 5 lakh, going all the way up to Rs 8 lakh (both prices, ex-showroom Delhi). Comparison Verdict The Maruti Suzuki Ignis’ popularity has grown since its mid-life update last year, and the Japanese carmaker manages to sell the car in decent numbers. However, the Mahindra KUV100 NXT is just holding on for dear life, and barely manages to find any takers in the country. While the companies might claim otherwise, the two cars can simply be classified as tallboy hatchbacks, while the upcoming Tata Punch will also pack some soft-road cred. Tata has previously claimed that the car will ‘Pack a Punch’ on every terrain, and the carmaker aims to achieve a sale of 18,000 – 20,000 units of the car each month. If Tata Motors manages to price the Punch sensibly, it can go on to become the country’s best-selling car.",

The first-of-its-kind action followed failure on part of the audit firm to comply with the regulator's directions. Earlier in the year, the RBI had tightened rules for statutory auditors, which shortened the tenure of auditors of banks. The RBI also prescribe joint audits for large financial institutions.The independence of auditors and role of ethics in the audit profession is critical, said Das. A fair and impartial audit helps instill confidence in stakeholders, he added.In his speech, Das stressed that statutory auditors have a responsibility to report directly to the regulator if they see any concerns emerging at financial entities regulated by it. The RBI's supervision focuses on audit quality related to identification of gaps, assessment of asset quality and innovative accounting practices, if any, which could have an impact on the capital base of regulated entities.Continue Reading.

[+] Sox in Game 6 of baseball's American League Championship Series Friday, Oct. 22, 2021, in Houston. The Astros won 5-0, to win the ALCS series in game six. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) ASSOCIATED PRESS One team that has become a recent fixture in the World Series will take on a team that hasn’t been to the Fall Classic in over two decades. The Astros are favored by the oddsmakers over the Atlanta Braves in this year’s World Series, which begins Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park in Houston. The Astros will be making their third appearance in the last five seasons. They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017 for a title that was tainted by an electronic sign-stealing scandal then lost to the Washington Nationals in 2019. The Braves last played in the World Series in 1999, falling to the New York Yankees. Houston advanced to this year’s World Series by beating the Chicago White Sox in four games in the ALDS and Boston Red Sox in six games in the ALCS. Atlanta downed the Milwaukee Brewers in four games in the NLDS then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in a six-game NLCS. Thus, both teams have identical 7-3 records in this postseason. Here are four players to watch in the World Series: YORDAN ALVAREZ, ASTROS The designed hitter is quite a bargain with a salary is $609,000. The 24-year-old is not yet eligible for salary arbitration, which has kept his earnings low to this point Alvarez was the Most Valuable Player of the ALCS as he went 12 for 23 (.522) with three doubles, one triple, one home run and six RBIS. In 10 games this postseason, he has a .441 batting average (15 for 34) with two homers.

He was the AL Rookie of the Year in 2019, hitting .313 with 27 home runs in 78 games then going 7 for 17 (.412) with a home run in the World Series. However, Alvarez was limited to just two games during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season before undergoing surgery on both knees. He bounced back during the 2021 regular season with a .277 batting average and 33 longballs in 144 games. Houston Astros starting pitcher Luis Garcia throws against the Boston Red Sox during the first ... [+] inning in Game 6 of baseball's American League Championship Series Friday, Oct. 22, 2021, in Houston. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) ASSOCIATED PRESS LUIS GARCIA, ASTROS Without a whole lot of fanfare, Garcia has had a fine rookie season. The 24-year-old had an 11-8 record and 3.30 ERA in 30 regular season games (28 starts) while striking out 167 in 155 1/3 innings. Garcia, like Alvarez, is cost-effective for Houston as his salary is just over the major league minimum of $570,500. The Astros also signed Garcia as an amateur free agent from Venezuela for just a $20,000 signing bonus. For comparison’s sake, University of Louisville catcher Henry Davis got a $6.5 million signing bonus from the Pittsburgh Pirates after being the first overall pick in this year’s MLB amateur draft. Garcia had to leave Game 2 of the ALCS in the second inning because of right knee soreness. However, he returned in Game 6 to dazzle as he held the Red Sox to one hit in 5.2 scoreless innings while getting the win in the pennant clincher. Atlanta Braves left fielder Eddie Rosario kisses the Most Valuable Player trophy after winning Game ... [+] 6 of baseball's National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers Sunday, Oct. 24, 2021, in Atlanta. The Braves defeated the Dodgers 4-2 to win the series. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) ASSOCIATED PRESS EDDIE ROSARIO, BRAVES The Atlanta Braves got a bonus when they acquired the left fielder from the Cleveland Indians in a trade July 30. The Indians agreed to pay $500,000 of what remained on Rosario $8 million salary. Furthermore, Cleveland took Pablo Sandoval’s contract from the Braves, ate what was left of his $1 salary and immediately released the veteran third baseman. Now, Rosario is coming off a record-setting performance as he tied an MLB record for a postseason series with 14 hits in winning NLCS MVP honors. Against the Dodgers, Rosario went 14 for 25 (.560) with one double, one triple, three home runs and nine RBIs. That comes after Rosario hit .271 with seven home runs in 33 regular season games following the trade. He also had four hits in 13 at-bats in the NLDS. Atlanta Braves pitcher Tyler Matzek reacts as he walks to the dugout after the eight inning against ... [+] the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 4 of baseball's National League Championship Series Wednesday, Oct. 20, 2021, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) ASSOCIATED PRESS TYLER MATZEK, BRAVES The left-handed reliever stemmed the tide in Game 6 of the NLCS once the Dodgers began to rally. The Dodgers had drawn within 4-2 in the seventh inning and had runners on second and third with no outs when Matzek was summoned to relieve Luke Jackson. Matzek struck out Albert Pujols, Steven Souza Jr. and Mookie Betts in succession to escape the jam then worked a 1-2-3 eighth as the Braves went on to win. Matzek has pitched in nine of the Braves’ 10 postseason games and has allowed two runs and four hits in 10 1/3 innings while striking out 17 of the 39 batters he has faced. In the regular season, he had a sparkling 2.57 ERA in 69 appearances with 77 strikeouts in 63 innings. It is all very impressive for a 31-year-old who found himself out of baseball in 2017 after severe control problems caused the Colorado Rockies and Chicago White Sox to release him. Matzek pitched in the minor leagues for two season before resurfacing in the big leagues with the Braves last year.",

BEIJING, Oct 25 — Shares of embattled Chinese developer Evergrande rose Monday after it said it had resumed work on more than 10 projects, as it sought to soothe fears about its debt struggles.The liquidity crisis at one of the nation’s biggest property developers has hammered investor sentiment, rattled China’s crucial real estate market and fuelled talk of spillover into the wider economy.But the firm — drowning in a sea of debt worth more than US$300 billion (RM1.24 trillion) — last week paid interest on an offshore bond just before a Saturday deadline, averting a default and giving it a much-needed reprieve.Evergrande was reported to have missed several offshore bond payments and while it had a 30-day grace period on some of them, there had been a general expectation it would not be able to meet its obligations.And today investors welcomed an announcement that its Shenzhen operations had “resumed work and production for more than 10 projects in six locations”.Shares in the firm rallied more than four per cent in early trade.The group had 778 projects spanning 233 cities in China as at end-June, according to its latest interim report.Work at some sites had been halted in recent months, however, while suppliers and contractors complained the company had yet to pay them.The firm has been plunged into crisis since Beijing began last year clamping down on the country’s colossal property sector — estimates say it accounts for a quarter of the economy — in a bid to rein in excessive debt.But the measures to restrict borrowing cut off companies’ ability to complete projects.Anxious homebuyers earlier told AFP they had turned up at unfinished sites to demand information.“Since the start of the year, strict regulation of the property market has plunged Evergrande into a crisis vortex,” the company said in a statement on its WeChat account Sunday.“How the company will resume work and production on hundreds of projects across the country, and deliver buildings on schedule, affects the nerves of the whole society,” added Evergrande.In a separate statement it provided progress updates on specific projects and said that “guaranteeing the delivery of buildings” was core to the company’s work. — Reuters",

Reddit is seeking a “senior backend engineer” for its “NFT platform,” the recently added job listing explains. Reddit has already dipped its feet into cryptocurrency solutions and blockchain technology by leveraging Ethereum and Arbitrum. The job listing for a new engineer dedicated to NFT technology has a different focus than the firm’s community points system. “If there is one thing we’ve noticed with NFTs, they too have an incredible power to create a sense of participation and belonging,” Reddit’s job post details. “With every new NFT project, a vibrant community of owners pops up with it. Fans of today’s biggest creators and brands are now flocking to buy digital goods directly from them — to support them, to gain exclusive access, and to feel a greater sense of connection with them.” The company’s job listing adds: Over time, we believe this will only grow, and NFTs will play a central role in how fans support their favorite creators and communities. Reddit: ‘Experience With Crypto / NFTs / Go Not Required’ While the job description has multiple requirements like over five years of backend development experience, experience with cryptocurrencies, NFTs and the programming language Go is “not required.” The backend, however, definitely will be dedicated to non-fungible token (NFT) services.

    "description": "Here’s what brokerages have to say about RIL’s second-quarter results:",
    "content": "Reliance Industries Ltd. reported an 11.5% sequential increase in net profit in the second quarter, helped by improved performance of its oil-to-chemical and retail segments. These two, analysts said, would be key to the company's growth.Rebound in demand across categories, as the economy opens up with easing of Covid-19 second wave restrictions, helped the retail segment. Improved realisation on an increase in oil prices, higher volumes, and better transportation fuel cracks supported the O2C segment, though partly offset by rising feedstock prices and softening of key polymer-naphtha spreads. Retail and O2C Ebitda grew 50% and 4% sequentially in the quarter ended September.The operating profit of the upstream (oil and gas) segment rose 34% sequentially to Rs 1,071 crore amid higher production from KG-D6 block and U.S. shale, and higher realisation.RIL's stock opened 2.7% higher than Friday’s close and was trading 0.24% higher as of 9.45 a.m. on Monday.Out of 36 analysts tracking the stock, 22 recommend 'buy', nine suggest a 'hold', and five have a 'sell' rating. The stock is trading above Bloomberg's consensus target price of Rs 2,586, still implying a price downside of 1.8%.Here’s what brokerages have to say about RIL’s second-quarter results:JefferiesReported in line Ebitda in retail and O2C, but missed estimates in Jio. Ebitda rose 37% year-on-year driven by a 20% rise in Jio, a 21% rise in retail, and a 42% rise in O2C.Petrochemical volumes rose 7% quarter-on-quarter on the back of strong domestic demand.China climate restrictions have cut refinery runs and tightened diesel supplies. This improves RIL's gross refining margin to $12 (calculated) now vs $7.1 in first half of FY22.Improvement in macro helped retail performance with acceleration in store additions to a multi-quarter high. Performance is broad-based, though fashion and lifestyle led the way.Jio's subscriber decline of 1.1 crore was a key disappointment. Further, increased cash expenses and low incremental Ebitda margins of 50% disappointed further.Cut consolidated earnings per share estimates marginally by 1% for FY23-24E to factor in lower subscriber estimates for Jio.There is a potential for a 10-12% upgrade to consensus estimates of O2C Ebitda if China doesn't go back on its climate goals in FY22E. Strong sequential growth is expected in retail Ebitda over second half of FY22E.Maintain 'buy' with a reduced target price of Rs 3,000 (from Rs 3,050 earlier), implying an upside price potential of 14.2%.JM FinancialPetrochemical margins were impacted due to high input cost, despite strong demand recovery.Retail business Ebitda rebounded due to the easing of lockdown restrictions and positive operating leverage.Jio’s net subscriber loss of 1.1 crores disappoint and could further push tariff hikes. A part of such subscriber loss could have been due to the impact of Jio phone users moving out after their three-year lock-in.Marginally cut FY22/FY23 Ebitda by 2.5%/0.3% due to moderation in Jio’s subscriber additions and expected delay in tariff hikes to first quarter of FY23.Refining margin improvement in the last few weeks driven by a strong recovery in global oil demand, gas to oil switching, supply outages, and resultant inventory drawdown. Reiterate 'buy' with an unchanged target price of Rs 2,800, implying an upside price potential of 6.5%.JP MorganRetail saw a meaningful quarter-on-quarter increase (Rs 2,900 crore, +50% quarter over quarter) given higher operating stores at 89% in second quarter vs 61% in first quarter, and footfalls at 78% of pre-Covid levels vs 46% in first quarter.O2C performance was supported by a sharp rally in diesel and jet cracks and the segment is expected to further improve in second half driven by refining. Exploration and production was strong and likely to improve given the lagged revisions in domestic prices.Jio’s average revenue per user was in line but the lower subscribers led to revenue and Ebitda miss.Capital expenditure stood at Rs 25,500 crore, and there were no new updates on renewables or Aramco stake sale progress.Maintain FY22-23 estimates as there is no earnings upgrade cycle for now. Refining and retail should be strong in the second half of FY22, while Jio’s performance depends on tariff hikes.Rate 'neutral' with a target price of Rs 2,465, implying a downside price potential of 6.2%.EmkayO2C Ebitda was impacted by 2% lower feedstock volumes quarter on quarter. GRMs were supported by higher transport fuel cracks, though polymer deltas were down 16-18% and polyester by 15-35%.Jio’s subs fell by 1.1 crore QoQ due to the churn in the low end. ARPU rose 4% QoQ to Rs 144.Operating conditions continued to improve retail performance, with 89% store operating hours in September 2021 vs 38% in June 2021. Footfalls also recovered to 90% in October 2021 vs 78%/46% in Q2/Q1. The recovery has been broad-based across formats.Net cash stood at Rs 3,590 crore in Q2. Capex was high at Rs 25,000 crore.Management was optimistic about post-pandemic demand recovery going ahead, coupled with higher realisations and margins in the hydrocarbon businesses.Increase FY22/23/24E EPS by 12%/7%/5%, building in higher GRMs and gas prices.Retain 'hold' rating with an 18% increase in target price to Rs 2,750, implying a upside potential of 4.7%.Motilal OswalO2C Ebitda per metric tonne stood at $100 (+49% year on year, +6% quarter on quarter) and benefitted from fuel cracks, efficient product placement, and yield management.Growth for Jio has slowed in the recent past, despite the significant increase in scale and given the lack of tariff action.Reliance Retail’s consistent performance over the last 4-5 years has been stellar and offers a huge scope of growth, given its strong growth footprint, enhanced digital capabilities in JioMart, Ajio, and new businesses/verticals.The consolidated gross debt remained largely flat at Rs 2,55,900 crore at the end of second quarter FY22 (vs Rs 2,53,900 crore at the end of first quarter FY22), with cash and equivalents at Rs 2,59,500 crore, translating in net cash of Rs 3,600 crore.Reiterate 'buy' with a target price of Rs 2,900/share, implying an upside price potential of 10.4%.ICICI DirectRevenue grew 20.6% QoQ led by retail and O2C segment. All segments reported growth in revenues.Discontinued customers on account of the second Covid-19 wave led to a net customer decline of 1.1 crores (churn rate of 3.6%) in Jio.The launch of JioPhone by Diwali is likely to improve the subscriber addition in Q3 while the ARPU hike seems to be pushed further as the company may focus on garnering more subscriber market share.Reliance Retail witnessed a sharp recovery with store operational days getting enhanced to 89% in second quarter of FY22 (in the first quarter of FY22, it was 61%). Strong recovery was witnessed in footfalls also and reached 78% of pre-Covid levels.Polymer and polyester margins declined QoQ due to higher feedstock prices and impacted sequential growth in O2C Ebitda that grew 4% QoQ. E&P segment revenue was driven by output growth from the KG basin. Revenue at Rs 1,644 crore was up 363.1% year on year (and 28.3% quarter on quarter).Steady fee cash flow generation in the retail segment, stake sale in the O2C segment to a strategic global player, and increment value accretion from the ‘digital ecosystem’ are the key stock triggers for future stock price performance.Maintain 'hold' with a target price of Rs 2,900, implying an upside potential of 10.4%.Goldman SachsThe retail segment stood out, with core Ebitda up 74% quarter on quarter/21% year on year driven by the omnichannel strategy, new stores' growth momentum, more merchant tie-ups and rising online mix.Energy segment Ebitda growth moderated to 4% QoQ as petrochemical prices narrowed while the exploration and production segment was ahead of our expectations.Expect refining and E&P to drive the next leg of growth for the energy segment while petrochemicals recovery will be sustained.Sustainable earnings recovery momentum driven by retail, telecom (tariff hike likely before CY21) and energy, new digital product launches, and further details on new energy business are likely to drive strong earnings growth of 41% compound annual growth rate over FY21E-23E.Cut FY22/23/24 Ebitda by -4%/-2%/-1% reflecting weaker O2C print in particular for petrochemicals on higher gas feedstock costs, lower Jio earnings through FY22/23 on lower reported subscriber count post second quarter miss.Maintain 'buy' with a target price of Rs 2,855, implying an upside potential of 8.7%.Morgan StanleyDemand improved across all verticals – gas, grocery, fashion and lifestyle, and refining.Telecom subscribers, especially broadband, have picked up well and demand is expanding for retail.Over the past year, Jio has seen nearly 9.5 crore subscriber churn. Higher churn in Jio also partly reflects higher subscriber market share in B&C circle areas.Doubling of high-margin apparel and footwear sales helped retail margins.Upstream Ebitda rose 34% QoQ and RIL’s domestic gas output rose 18.4% QoQ. RIL expects further increase in output, to 30 million standard cubic meters per day by 2023.Air travel pickup, China's dual controls, energy transition, gas average selling price, and growth in e-commerce combine to trigger the upgrade cycle for RIL.Rate 'overweight' with a price target of Rs 2,925, implying an upside potential of 11.3%.

FRANKFURT, Oct 25 — Pressure is growing on the European Central Bank (ECB) to respond to rising inflation in the eurozone, as its counterparts in the United States and the United Kingdom signal willingness to take action.ECB policymakers will meet on Thursday, with markets hoping for hints on when the bank might start raising historically low interest rates or tweak the pace of bond buying under its massive pandemic-era stimulus programme.Bottlenecks have pushed up prices and pinched industrial production in the eurozone, drawing a tightrope for policymakers to walk as withdrawing stimulus to quash inflation risks further crimping the economic recovery.In September, prices in the euro area rose 3.4 per cent year on year, a 13-year high pushed by the cost of energy, and well above the bank’s two-per cent target.At the same time, material shortages linked to the pandemic have stalled the economic recovery in parts of the eurozone.Eurozone business sentiment in October was at its lowest point since April, according to an IHS Markit survey published last week, with shortages being felt particularly in European powerhouse Germany and its vital automotive sector.President Christine Lagarde has however said the ECB would not “overreact” to what the bank’s economists see as “transitory” inflation driven by one-off pandemic effects.‘Getting closer’ At the end of September, the heads of the world’s biggest central banks came together at the ECB’s monetary policy summit to discuss the problems facing them.The US Federal Reserve was “getting closer” to meeting its targets to start winding down its own stimulus programme, its chair Jerome Powell said in a panel discussion with Lagarde and colleagues from the UK and Japan.Members of its policy-making committee also expect the Fed to start raising interest rates at the end of 2022 — a prospect which has yet to officially materialise at the ECB as the bank’s medium-term inflation forecasts continue to sit below its target.The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said in mid-October that his institution “will have to act” on inflation, bringing forward expectations of a rise in interest rates.Other central banks within the European Union have responded aggressively to rising prices.The Polish central bank hiked interest rates at the beginning of October for the first time in almost a decade, while its Czech counterpart raised rates sharply in September to tame soaring inflation.Zen master Despite some dissent among members of the governing council, the ECB seemed “pretty zen”, said Bruno Cavalier, economist at Oddo.In a letter last week announcing his resignation to colleagues, Jens Weidmann, the president of the German central bank and a prominent advocate of tight monetary policy, said it would be “decisive” for the ECB’s strategy “not to lose sight of future inflation risks”.Upwards pressure on prices would however “largely fade out over the course of next year,” Isabel Schnabel, who sits on the executive board of the ECB, said earlier this month.The ECB has long held its interest rates at historic lows, including a negative bank deposit rate that means lenders pay to park excess cash at the ECB.While markets are pricing in a small rates rise in 2022, analysts at ING doubted that the first increase would come “before late 2023”.The ECB’s 25-member governing council left interest rates untouched, but dialled back its bond-buying scheme at its last meeting in September.The 1.85-trillion-euro (US$2.15-trillion) pandemic emergency bond-buying programme (PEPP) is the ECB’s main crisis-fighting tool, aimed at keeping borrowing costs low to stoke economic growth.The expectation is that the scheme will end in March, but ideas are percolating amongst observers and the central bank’s policymakers as to how existing schemes could be modified to maintain support.“Flexibility” had been the success of the pandemic programme, France’s central bank boss Francois Villeroy de Galhau said earlier this month. — AFP",

    "content": "HSBC had a tumultuous 2020 as its fortunes took a hammering from both the coronavirus and simmering geopolitical tensions.— Reuters pic Follow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates. HONG KONG, Oct 25 — HSBC is emerging from its coronavirus and restructuring troubles to become more reliably profitable, boss Noel Quinn said today as he announced the start of a US$2 billion share buyback.The Asia-reliant lender had a tumultuous 2020 as its fortunes took a hammering from both the coronavirus and simmering geopolitical tensions.Quinn has since overseen a dramatic restructuring, slashing the bank’s workforce by about 35,000 and refocusing on its most profitable areas in Asia and the Middle East, a tactic he said was now paying dividends.“While we retain a cautious outlook on the external risk environment, we believe that the lows of recent quarters are behind us,” Quinn wrote in a note attached to the bank’s third-quarter results.“This confidence, together with our strong capital position, enables us to announce a share buyback of up to US$2 billion (RM8.3 billion), which we expect to commence shortly,” he added.The results statement showed HSBC’s pre-tax profit more than doubled on-year in the third quarter to US$5.4 billion. Profit after tax came in at US$4.2 billion, up from US$2.2 billion the same period last year.HSBC makes 90 per cent of its profit in Asia, with China and Hong Kong the major drivers of growth.In February it published a new strategy laying out plans to redouble its attempt to seize more of the Asian market.Weighed down by low interest rates, it is planning to seek out more fee-based income, especially wealth management for Asia’s increasingly affluent.Earlier this year the bank sold its 90 branches in the United States and completed a long-running disposal of its unprofitable French retail business.While all banks were hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, HSBC also had to deal with another added wrinkle — geopolitical tensions.HSBC’s historical and present-day connections to China are both its major selling point and a source of vulnerability.It has found itself more at risk than most global banks to the increasingly frayed relationship between China and western powers — especially after Beijing imposed a draconian security law on Hong Kong last year.HSBC endorsed the security law, a move that led to criticism from lawmakers in Britain and the United States, and has frozen the accounts of some Hong Kong democracy activists at the request of local authorities.At the same time the lender has found itself called out by Chinese state media for providing information that helped lead to the arrest in Canada of a top Huawei executive.HSBC says it has to obey the laws in each jurisdiction it operates in. — AFP",

Supported by many leading VCs and famous Grammy-winning artists, the NFT platform raised $1.0 million during the private sale that generated major interest from top investors and venture capitalists in the finance and blockchain industries. A major milestone for Label Foundation The private sale round was led by HG ventures and backed by some of the leading venture capitals and institutions in the blockchain sphere, such as GBIC, Mindfulness Capital, IOST, M6, Adaptive, and Icetea Labs, Alphabit,, and Pragma. These Venture Capital firms have joined forces to fund the next generation NFT infrastructure that provides the P2P incubating platform to foster the education platform. Speaking on the development, Simon Jeung co-founder at HG Ventures, revealed his delight in the development. “As the lead investors in the LABEL Foundation, we are first and foremost fascinated by the dedication of the core team to the unified goal to revolutionize the entertainment education market by bringing the MOOC industry and blockchain technology together. Jeung also added, ‘’We believe that NFTs will definitely need the next level of adoption, and the musicians, artists and other content creators that were previously restrained from their legitimate profits will now be able to protect their rightful IP rights in the most innovative NFT infrastructure platform.” He concluded. Fostering next-gen blockchain-based educational ecosystem Label is an NFT infrastructure protocol built on the Ethereum Network to establish a fair profit-sharing ecosystem. Its ecosystem is powered by LBL utility and governance token. To achieve its goals, LABEL introduces a decentralized P2P incubating platform to invest in world-class entertainment educational content through the DAO voting system that allows contributors to claim profits through its native NFT shareholding mechanism. This system provides content creators in the MOOC industry easy access to investment, promotion and distribution of their IP rights. It solves the problems of unfair structure that exists in the sphere. Tokenizing IP rights using NFTs Label Foundation further innovatively uses NFTs enabling content creators to tokenize their IP rights to allow investors to fund their prospective courses. These courses are listed on the Label platform and, over time, become profitable and influential for investors. The interests on these tokenized IP rights can be accessed by LBL Holders that stake their tokens in the DAO governance mechanisms for voting rights on which courses are registered and receive financing in the Label ecosystem. The courses, that have successfully received investments, will be registered in the ERC-1155 NFT standard, which will clearly illustrate the share ratio of the ownership according to the contributions of instructors, voters and investors. The information on sales revenue from partner platforms will be released on the special NFT Page, and the revenue generated by the course will be accurately distributed based on the NFT Shares held by the contributors. Furthermore, the investors that are willing to liquidate their NFT shares will be able to register it freely in the NFT Marketplace of the LABEL Foundation, or similarly they can retain their access to the IP rights and claim the partial profits that will be generated by the content creators’ courses. Key partnerships established Label Foundation has extended its ecosystem with key partnerships within the blockchain and education industry. It has already collaborated with OPENTRACK, a leading music education platform operated by Clesson. The partnership will provide a batch of world-class instructors that will provide early content within the LABEL ecosystem. The LABEL Platform will feature the top stars such as Mark Lettieri (3x Grammy Winner), Scoop DeVille (2x Grammy Nominee), Robert Sput Searight (6x Grammy Winner), Docskim (BTS producer) and many other influential artists and instructors, that will be sharing their knowledge and insights and perhaps offer their IP rights through the incubating system to register their courses as NFTs and further allocate the NFT shares to the early investors.

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - Jawa’s upcoming cruiser was spied during a road test in India, and we believe it will be powered by the brand’s 334cc 30.64 PS engine Classic Legends has a few new models in the pipeline, under the existing Jawa brand and the upcoming Yezdi brand, to expand its lineup in our market. Spy pictures of these forthcoming motorcycles have been floating around the internet, and recently, a new cruiser model was spotted undergoing road tests. In the spy pictures we have here, we see that the cruiser was covered in full-body camouflage. Despite that, a few design details are visible here; the motorcycle gets a split-seat setup, and the cushioning seems great, which could be great for long rides. The rear fender stretches out long and gets round taillights and round turn indicators at the end. The motorcycle gets a blacked-out exhaust, featuring the same design as other Jawa motorcycles. We also see dual rear shockers and conventional telescopic front forks here, along with grab handles just below the pillion seat. Both the rider and pillion footrests are slightly forward-set, which should give the bike a relaxed seating posture. The instrument cluster can’t be seen here, so we can’t comment on that. The cruiser will get single disc brakes on both wheels, likely with dual-channel ABS, and bar-end mirrors. We’re not sure how close this test model is to production, but there might be a few changes to the bike before the final version is unveiled. Sadly, we only have a single snap of the test bike here, which limits our speculations. We believe this upcoming Jawa cruiser could be powered by the brand’s 334c, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder engine, the same one that powers the Jawa Perak. This powerplant is rated at a peak power of 30.64 PS and a maximum torque of 32.74 Nm, and it comes paired with a 6-speed sequential gearbox. We expect Jawa’s cruiser to launch in India sometime during 2022, and it will likely be priced in the same ballpark as the Jawa Perak. Its chief competitor in the Indian market will be Royal Enfield Meteor 350, and it will also rival the likes of RE Classic 350 and Honda H’ness CB350.

    "content": "If governments won’t act quickly enough on climate change, who will? Enter the new breed of (mostly young) billionaire philanthropists. Their goal is to use their influence and money to push the boundaries of science and technology for society’s benefit. One example is Mike Cannon-Brookes, billionaire co-founder of software developer Atlassian and his partner Annie Cannon-Brooke who this month pledged A$1.5 billion to invest in climate projects by 2030. $1 billion will be in financial investments and $500 million in philanthropic and advocacy work, with the aim of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees. He wants other executives to follow suit. In the US the world’s largest funds manager Blackrock has injected funds into billionaire Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, which is using philanthropic money to accelerate investments in new technologies. Breakthrough has reportedly secured US$1 billion in investments from Microsoft, General Motors, American Airlines, Boston Consulting Group, Bank of America and ArcelorMittal. In India, in Denmark, in Australia In India, its richest citizen Mukesh Ambani has pledged to take his energy giant net-zero by 2035, an undertaking he will fulfil by switching to renewable sources and converting carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals. Australia’s Andrew Forrest has established Fortescue Future Industries as part of Fortescue Metals with a mandate to invest billions in Green Hydrogen projects in Queensland and NSW and to take the mining group carbon-neutral by 2040. Read more: The AFR's 2021 Rich List shows we're not all in this together Elsewhere a Danish sceptic on carbon pricing Bjørn Lomborg has made a case for innovation in energy research in energy research as the way to limit carbon emissions, citing a parallel from the 1860’s when whales were hunted to near extinction for oil that was used to light homes. He says the solution was not to tax whales, it was the invention of kerosene that undercut the cost of whale oil. What’s happening isn’t new In 1919 businessman Raymond Orteig offered US$25,000 for the first person to fly non-stop from New York to Paris. The prize was won by an unknown 25-year-old US Army Reserve officer, Charles Lindberg, spurring enormous advances in aviation. Le Journals’ coverage of Charles A. Lindbergh’s 33 hour flight from New York to Pariswhich won him US$25,000 in prize money. Today, the X Prize Foundation and the Musk Foundation are offering a US$100 million X Prize for Carbon Removal funded by billionaire Elon Musk. The prize will go to the team from anywhere on the planet who can invent a machine that extracts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or oceans at gigatonne-scale. Previous X Prizes have been awarded for the application of artificial intelligence to global issues, turning carbon dioxide into useful products, developing cheaper methods of mass testing for COVID, and creating water from thin air. Horses for courses There is a sound argument that important pledges and projects should be the responsibility of governments rather than individuals. Billionaires often get where they are by acting on self-interest, so it isn’t reasonable to expect them to act in the interest of the entire public. Read more: Bill and Melinda Gates: philanthropy caught in the crosshairs of society's obsession with celebrity On the other hand, some problems are too important and time sensitive to leave in the hands of governments that can’t act with agility. If an individual loses their money, it’s their loss. If the government loses the money, its the taxpayer’s loss. So governments have to be cautious. It’s probably not a matter of one or the other. Governments shouldn’t abandon their responsibility to act in the public interest. On the other hand, wealthy philanthropists throughout history have been prepared to help.

    "content": "GaadiWaadi - Royal Enfield Himalayan 650 is expected to make a global debut in late 2024 and it could be offered in two variants Royal Enfield introduced the new Classic 350 only a few months ago and it has been well received amongst customers. The brand is working on a number of new launches over the next twelve months and is expected to host the global premiere of the Super Meteor, a cruiser based on the 650 Twins’ platform, at the 2021 EICMA show in Milan, Italy before likely launching it in early 2022. The homegrown manufacturer has been reaping the benefits of its latest product range in the international markets as the Himalayan, Interceptor 650, Continental GT 650, and Meteor 350 have gained tremendous attention. The 650 cc platform will further be strengthened with the arrival of the Himalayan 650 in the near future. Here are the five things we know about it already: 1. Launch: The Royal Enfield Himalayan 650 is only expected to go on sale around 2024 as the world debut is planned for the same year and the project has reportedly commenced around a year and a half ago. It was also said to be not part of the initial plan when the 650 cc platform with a parallel twin-cylinder motor was developed. The report further suggested that the architecture was initially thought to be difficult to adapt for an adv. Representational 2. Different Positioning: The project for the flagship dual-purpose adventure motorcycle was given the nod when the oldest motorcycle maker in continuous production found that plenty of demand exists for such a machine with a 650 cc engine as the current Himalayan has its limitations while cruising on the highway. 3. Could Carry A Different Name: RE may give a separate identity to the upcoming adventure motorcycle as a different name could be given. It will be offered in two variants – one with alloy wheels and the other with spoked rims. The former will be positioned as a sports tourer and the latter will be known as the adventure tourer but the Himalayan 650 in its entirety won’t be a proper adv reportedly. 4. Mechanicals: The upcoming Royal Enfield Himalayan 650 will ride on a 19-inch front wheel and not 21-incher and the seat height will be higher than the existing model alongside a high-mounted exhaust system. It will carry a similar styling as the Himalayan 400 by about 80-85 per cent. In addition, better brakes, a TFT instrument cluster, ride modes, and traction control will be available. 5. Price: The Royal Enfield Himalayan 650 is expected to carry a starting price of around Rs. 4 lakh (ex-showroom) and thus it will undercut a host of middleweight premium adventure motorcycles.

[+] basket to force overtime during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the New York Knicks Wednesday, Oct. 20, 2021, in New York. The Knicks won 138-134. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) ASSOCIATED PRESS The first three games of the 2021-22 regular season haven’t been particularly pretty for the Celtics. Boston’s offense has yet to find its rhythm, with turnovers plaguing Ime Udoka’s team through its first two losses. Despite the ups and downs, Grant Williams has been a major bright spot early on, and that continued Sunday night against the Houston Rockets. Williams entered training camp down 15 pounds from last season. He put on weight earlier in his career to play the role of a small-ball big man, but this summer he cut down to regain his quickness and versatility. The 22-year-old spoke about his shooting at length during the preseason, and he’s backed it up with his play so far this season. Williams scored 18 points on 6-of-8 shooting in 30 minutes in Sunday’s win over the Rockets, going 5-of-7 from 3. He’s now 8-of-12 from deep through three regular season games. The improvement might come as a surprise for some fans, but Udoka and Williams spoke about his shooting shortly after Udoka took the Celtics head coaching job this summer. “He works on it every day, he works extremely hard,” Udoka said Sunday. “Came back in great shape. He asked me in the summer, months ago when I got hired, what can he do and I said, ‘Get that 3-point percentage up to 40 and defend,’ and he’s doing all of that right now.” Williams has made a massive impact on both ends of the floor for Boston through its first three games. The Celtics had a dramatic double-overtime loss to begin the season against the Knicks, but if it weren’t for Williams’ 11-point fourth quarter, they wouldn’t have even had a chance to tie the game at the end of regulation. On Sunday, it was his steadying presence as a perimeter threat and capable switcher on defense that helped keep Boston afloat after an ugly start. Entering the preseason, there was set to be a roster battle for minutes toward the back-end of the Celtics rotation. Williams was in the thick of that fight, alongside players such as Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith and Juancho Hernangomez, to name a few. Just a week into the season, it is clear that Williams separated himself and came out on top, something Udoka credited to his consistency.

He’s been shooting it great throughout camp, not that the other guys haven’t, but some of the things he does on both ends of the floor are what kind of separated it. He’s just a young guy and we don’t always look at him in the same mode as Payton (Pritchard), Aaron (Nesmith) and Romeo (Langford) and those guys, but he’s a young guy as well and somebody that we want to see that growth from. He came back, like I said, in shape and has really taken advantage of his opportunity with Al (Horford) and some of the guys out.” All of those characteristics are things that Williams embodies, and it shows on the floor. The Tennessee product isn’t going to let the good start go to his head, however. He’s determined to stick to what helped him in training camp. “Just consistency,” Williams said Sunday. “Biggest thing for me is just trying to stay consistent throughout the whole year. Not go through ups and downs and be a person that is relied on and reliable. That is probably my most important thing. Everything else will take care of itself.” The Celtics roster lacks shooting, which makes Williams’ recent improvements that much more important. The offense has looked choppy to say the least, even in Sunday’s win, but having Williams as a reliable constant makes a major difference. If Williams can be a consistent perimeter threat for Boston while bringing his defensive versatility, it will make life a lot easier for Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and, more than anyone, Udoka. Filling whatever role is needed of him with his versatility is something Williams takes pride in. “It’s a difficult job, but it’s what I signed up for,” Williams said. “Provide value to this team in any way possible. Whatever they need me to do. That’s something I take pride in. Being a versatile guy — a guy that can stay on the floor no matter what the situation is. If I ever get to a point where that’s not important to me, then I’ll be out of this league.” Tatum knows how important Williams has been for the Celtics of late. “I’m happy for him. We need it,” Tatum said. “Grant has worked extremely hard on his shot since he first got into the league, and being able to be a threat out there is only going to make us better. ... For us to be a good team we have to space the floor and need guys to knock down shots like that. He knows his role and he plays it very well. Just adding the ability to hit those shots is big for him and big for us.”",

    "content": "TORONTO – The ousted chairman of Rogers Communication Inc. says he’ll go to the British Columbia Supreme Court in a bid to wrest back control of the company. Edward Rogers made the assertion after holding a meeting that included five hand-picked directors, meant to replace members of the board that on Thursday removed him as its chair. Edward Rogers was replaced as chair of Rogers Thursday after media reports that he tried but failed to put former chief financial officer Tony Staffieri into the role of CEO and replace other members of the leadership team. A statement from his camp says Edward Rogers was elected chair of the board at Sunday’s meeting. An earlier statement from Rogers’ three siblings and the board they endorse pre-emptively rejected any outcome of Sunday night’s meeting, saying that only the board as it existed Thursday has any authority. The statement says it comes from a group representing the majority of the board. But Edward Rogers remains chair of the Rogers Control Trust, the controlling shareholder, which, along with Rogers family members, owns 97 per cent of Class A voting shares. In a series of tweets on Sunday, Martha Rogers, brother of Edward, said she promised to share “the truth” about her brother’s “Trump scandal” from May when he and his family were photographed with the former U.S. President. “[I] haven’t gone anywhere, and not [am] deterred by Navigator’s lame personal attacks,” read one of Martha’s tweets. “Just wanted to thank everyone for calling them out when they do, you guys are my heroes.” Haven’t gone anywhere, and not deterred by Navigator’s lame personal attacks. Just wanted to thank everyone for calling them out when they do, you guys are my heroes. ???? — Martha Rogers (@MarthaLRogers) October 24, 2021 Martha also tweeted that her brother “won’t win” any lawsuit.

The largest city on Lake Erie is causing a stir in London, as healthcare provider Cleveland Clinic is plotting a foreign expansion that is promising doctors across the pond salaries unheard of in England. A Whole New Ball Game Private hospitals in the UK normally hire doctors employed by the publicly funded National Health Service as consultants in their spare time on a fee-for-service basis. That keeps costs down, as doctors only get paid when they are treating patients. But Cleveland Clinic — a multibillion dollar healthcare powerhouse headquartered in Cleveland with affiliate hospitals in Florida, Nevada, Canada, and Abu Dhabi — is throwing that model out the window for its UK debut, offering hefty salaries to doctors at its soon-to-open 184-bed hospital near London's Buckingham Palace: Cleveland Clinic London is offering at least 270 specialists salaries of £300,000 ($413,000) to £350,000 ($482,000) per year for just two days of work a week or less — while allowing them to keep their jobs with the NHS. One private hospital anonymously told the Financial Times that an expensive bidding war ensued that was akin to \"the Premier League on transfer deadline day\" — when soccer teams there drop big bucks on top-line free agents. Health Scares: \"By employing them directly for all their non-NHS work, the Cleveland Clinic is taking the financial risk of finding enough patients to keep the consultant busy,\" Ted Townsend, an analyst at LaingBuisson, told the FT . Even though there has been a surge in private healthcare treatments in the UK during the last year, it is likely due to a backlog caused by the pandemic — not a change in consumer behavior.",

It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day. Depending on who you ask, trendy hard seltzer brand White Claw is either the greatest thing since humans started fermenting drinks in 7000 BC or the most annoying Instagram accessory since the app was founded in 2010. But for Boston Beer, the storied maker of Sam Adams, the hard selter craze prompted by White Claw has turned from boon to bust — the company lost money in a quarter for only the fifth time in 26 years thanks to a big bet on its bubbly alcoholic drink, Truly. The Morning After Led by White Claw, the hard seltzer market took off in recent years and hit $4.3 billion in annual sales last year as waist-watching consumers flocked to low-calorie alcohol options. At the peak of the craze, in late 2019, sales were so high that stores were rationing White Claw before rationing was a thing. Molson Coors, Constellation, Anheuser-Busch, and other big brewers rushed in with their own hard seltzers to capitalize. But hard seltzer sales are now coming down from a malted, gluten-free sugar high. Beginning in June, monthly retail sales growth of hard seltzers fell from 16% in the previous three months to around 10%. And no one has been hit harder than Boston Beer: Boston lost $58 million in the latest quarter because demand for its hard seltzer fell off a cliff, forcing the company to take a $100 million writedown after throwing out inventory and paying shortfall costs to vendors. Its stock already down 47% on the year, Boston said 2021 retail sales for the hard seltzer market will come up 100 million cases short of estimates. We Are Not Alone: Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona and Model, took a $66 million obsolescence charge on its hard seltzer line in August, which caused it to miss Wall Street earnings estimates. No Can Brew: Beer sales, meanwhile, continue to fall. Molson Coors' ale sales, for instance, were off 6.4% in the first six months of the year.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Jeff Scott took over as head coach at South Florida in December 2019. A 34-14 win over visiting ... [+] Temple on October 23, 2021 was his first over an FBS program. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) ASSOCIATED PRESS They were not tearing down the goalposts like they did at Columbia in 1988 after the Lions defeated Princeton to snap a 44-game losing streak. Or rush the field to prop players up on their shoulders and march one of the uprights out of the stadium (and deposit it into an adjacent reservoir) like the cadets did when Army defeated Cincinnati in 2004 to snap what at the time was the nation’s longest losing streak at 19 games. No such displays of jubilation took place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa on Saturday night following South Florida’s 34-14 relentless pounding of Temple. However, while the Bulls were not lugging around a streak like those noted above, it was three years since they last won a conference game on their own turf and were within three days of the two-year mark since they last defeated an FBS opponent. Hence, snapping losing streaks of 17 games to FBS teams, 13 games versus conference opponents and 10 games against conference opponents at home — and how they did it — provided a much-need dose of euphoria for coach Jeff Scott’s team. “It was a long time coming,” said Scott, who took a long time to make it down the hall to his press conference as a prolonged celebration in the home locker room was, well, a long time coming after what was his first victory over an FBS program as a head coach. What made the win especially rewarding for the second-year coach, whose ever-flowing enthusiasm, class and character have resonated throughout the USF community and points beyond since taking over the program in December 2019, is that the victory came one week after what he described as his toughest loss in quite some time, a 32-31 heartbreaker against visiting Tulsa.

The team he inherited last year did not have the foundation, or character, to respond to tough losses in a positive way. This year’s group, which has displayed the effort and maturity instilled by the 40-year-old former Clemson co-offensive coordinator as he continues to put his stamp on the program, responded to the adversity by quickly turning the page from Tulsa, but not forgetting the bad taste the defeat left. “I have felt that this group is different,” said Scott. “But these are the weeks you have to show that difference. If we came out and had the same response as we did last year, then it is hard to say that we are really different. I expected them to play the way they did (Saturday night) because of how they have stuck together.” In particular, Scott praised the players that predate him at USF, a core group that endured 27 losses in 33 games (since a 7-0 start in 2018) and the aforementioned streaks. It is, after all, very easy to enter the transfer portal and search for greener grass. “It’s been tough on our staff for two years,” he said. “It has been a challenge, but these guys have been here three and four years and have not had a lot of success. For that group to continue to stay together is very uncommon (in college football these days).” Perhaps not surprisingly, it was one of those veterans who, through his effort Saturday night, underscored what Scott is attempting to build at USF. The Bulls took the opening kickoff and drove to Temple’s 10-yard-line, where the drive stalled resulting in a field goal attempt. An errant snap was scooped up by the Owls’ Keyshawn Paul, who was on his way for what seemed to be a 66-yard return for a touchdown and an early Temple lead. Instead, 6-foot-4, 240-pound tight end Chris Carter sprinted down the field to tackle the 5-foot-11, 195-pound Paul, who had roughly a 15-yard head start, at the five yard line. (Paul was a freshman at UConn when he started against the Bulls on October 20, 2018. USF defeated the Huskies that day in what was their most recent home win against a conference opponent.) Four plays later, the Bulls’ Mekhi LaPointe intercepted a D’Wan Mathis pass in the end zone. USF took the ensuing drive 80 yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead, a lead they would not relinquish. “It was a great example of when an event happens, what is your response going to be,” said Scott. “You can’t control the event that just happened, but your response will dictate the outcome. To see Chris Carter run (Paul) down, that is the heart of this team right there. That effort he had in running him down, and then our defense to go out and have first-and-goal at the five and allow zero points, I think that set the attitude and mindset for the game right there.” True, it was only one game and one win and it came against an inconsistent Temple squad. How does Scott’s team respond to such a victory with a short week before taking the field at ECU on Thursday night? Did the victory serve as a starting point for a prosperous second half and a springboard into something much bigger and better down the road? All that, of course, remains to be seen. What is evident is how a team, one that has mightily struggled to pick up wins, has stuck together to give itself something to build on.",

It’s happening,” he predicted. Many people disagreed with him, however. US Will Soon Experience Hyperinflation, Says Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey The CEO of Twitter and Square Inc., Jack Dorsey, tweeted a warning about hyperinflation in the U.S. Friday. “Hyperinflation is going to change everything. It’s happening,” he wrote. Comments flooded his tweet. At the time of writing, it had garnered more than 7K comments and had been liked 70.1K times and retweeted 22.9K times. In a follow-up tweet, Dorsey emphasized: “It will happen in the U.S. soon, and so the world.” The Twitter CEO’s tweet came as consumer price inflation is running near a 30-year high in the U.S. and there are increasing concerns that the problem could be worse than what policymakers led on. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged Friday that inflation pressures “are likely to last longer than previously expected,” and could run “well into next year.” However, many people disagreed with the Twitter boss that hyperinflation is going to happen in the U.S. Patrick Horan, program manager for Monetary Policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, opined: “In the United States, hyperinflation is not happening.” His colleague, Lawrence White, professor of economics at the same university, chimed in: “What’s happening is higher inflation, not hyperinflation (except in Venezuela). It’s too bad that Twitter doesn’t allow Jack to edit his tweet.” Daniel Drezner, professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, noted: “I lived through actual hyperinflation in Ukraine in the early 1990s. This ain’t it mate.” Economist Steve Hanke, a bitcoin skeptic who prides himself as an expert on inflation and hyperinflation, commented: There have been 62 certified hyperinflations in world history. At present, no country is experiencing hyperinflation. Jack should know better than to tweet irresponsible public statements. While a number of people on Twitter disagreed with Hanke’s statement, Dorsey simply replied with a “rolling on the floor laughing” emoji. Some people heeded Dorsey’s warning, tweeting, “Thank God for bitcoin,” noting that BTC will inevitably become the world’s reserve currency. Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, commented on Dorsey’s hyperinflation tweet: Those shocked by this tweet live in a bubble of financial privilege. 1.3 billion live under double, triple, or quadruple-digit inflation: Turkey, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Iran, Lebanon, Venezuela, Cuba, Sudan, and beyond.

[+] wife of popular Indian actor Ayushmann Khurrana. Tahira Kashyap Indian writer-filmmaker Tahira Kashyap’s fifth and latest book, 7 Sins of Being A Mother is out and she has not shied away from any detail in her journey of motherhood. After hopping careers for a few years, Kashyap settled for her passion - storytelling - only a few years ago. She has since written books such as The 12 Commandments of Being A Woman . She has also made critically acclaimed short films including Toffee, Pinni and Quaranteen Crush . Next up, she has her debut feature film Sharmajee Ki Beti slated for release soon. The filmmaker is the wife of popular Indian actor Ayushmann Khurrana and believes in making space for herself. In her new book, Kashyap talks about taboo subjects such as sexual desire of women. She also opens up on how her husband, unknowingly, played a role in her guilt trips during early motherhood. Given the set-up that she lives in, even immediate family may not cheer her endeavours. The filmmaker-writer says she is yet to show the book to her mom or mother-in-law. “They are going to hit the roof when they read it. I am going to be disowned soon. I will be kicked out of the house. The book is very blasphemous and very intimate. It is about how women are put into stereotypes and how they think each woman is a prototype of others. The box and the mould becomes smaller when you become a mom and you are expected to be this holier-than-thou person. My book does not offer any tips or any kind of expert help for moms. It is just my journey which was pretty sinful.” Talking about the desires of women is not normal in Indian set-ups. Things become tougher if you are talking about sexual desires, more so if you want to talk about sexual desires of mothers. However, Kashyap wants to break the stereotypes and open up conversations. “The fact is that you do not just stop having sex when you become a mother. You may want to, because as a mother your priorities are different. But, you will not stop sleeping on the same bed as your partner. Sadly, it (expectation of lack of sexual desire in women after having babies) is not just something that comes from our age-old family traditions it is also something that my doctor told me. Kashyap goes on to elaborate and says, “The doctor expected us to maintain distance, and not have ‘relations’ which I could not understand for the longest time. What does relation mean? He is my husband, I am his wife that is our relationship! But, she kept harping ‘relations, relations’. Then I understood that she was talking about sex. I asked her if there was anything wrong with me biologically or physically. She said I was, adding that it was ‘just good to have holy and pious thoughts during pregnancy’. I was shocked this was coming from a doctor. With my book, I want to address these things.” MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge She also says that she was “not always born to be a mother”, adding that she was just 28 when she had her first child. “Honestly speaking, it was a role that I learnt along the way. It is expected that you have gamut of emotions and you embrace and fall in love with your child instantly. My instant reaction was ‘get this thing out of me’. I mean, I had had 12 hours of excruciating labour that ended with a cesarean. The doctor was waiting with my baby and I could see two sets of eyes judging me, one was my baby and the doctor’s. Both of them staring at me and I just could not bring myself to open my arms and embrace my son and smother him with my kisses. I was just amused and the maximum I could do was wriggle my nose against his. Then I told the doctor that take him to his family and the doctor was shocked. If that is a sin, it is but my love for my child grew over time. It was just not love at first sight.” Kashyap says that her new book is not just meant for moms. “Not just moms, women in general. If you are a woman or identify as one, you are subjected to so many expectations in the patriarchal set-up that we are in.” “I am obsessed with women, you are right. I feel very less has been told about them and the little amount that has been told is very stereotypical. I want to say we are equally heroic, interesting dark and villainous. I will continue telling stories i would love to tell stories of men too but somehow I gravitate to talk about women and their liberation,” she says as she wraps up. (The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.)",

[+] Region International Airport in Lansing, Michigan, on October 5, 2021. - Biden traveled to Michigan to speak about his infrastructure bill and Build Back Better agenda. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Senate Democrats continue to fight among themselves over President Joe Biden’s proposed $3.5 trillion 10-year spending plan for so-called “human infrastructure,” a massive expansion of the social safety net. Most likely, it will be killed or scaled back into a “skinnier” version . Nevertheless, in real time, the $3.5T bill is the only legislation on the table and many provisions will likely be resurrected in future legislation. While the Democrat-backed bill dubbed the Build Back Better Act has no Republican support, it only needs 51 votes to pass — 50 votes plus VP Kamala Harris breaking a tie — going through a process called reconciliation . Our auditors at OpenTheBooks.com read the bill and reviewed what Congressional Democrats packed into this massive legislation: $500 billion over 10 years to give 12 weeks of paid time off to workers to care for new children or an ailing relative “by blood or affinity.” $1 trillion to extend a turbocharged child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under age six and $3,000 for older dependents $108 billion for tuition-free community college , making states partially pick up the tab after a few years. Undocumented immigrants and the wealthy would be eligible. $200 billion for universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds, benefitting about 5 million children from families of all income levels and making states foot about 50 percent of the bill. $250 billion for childcare to all families, including the wealthy , to keep the cost of child care at or below 7 percent of most families' income. Beyond the pricey agenda for children and families, OpenTheBooks.com found massive spending on climate change and green energy policy, among other things: $3.5 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps at public land agencies to advance a green agenda, which is on top of $4.5 billion for the same purpose at the Department of Agriculture $960 million to install and upgrade biofuel infrastructure in gas stations and fueling facilities, as well as giving $9.7 billion in grants and loans for clean energy repowering of rural utilities $34 billion+ in subsidies to “green” energy special interests to advance radical elements of the Green New Deal, allegedly addressing air pollution. Create a $1,500 per ton tax on natural gas, costing the economy as much as $9.1 billion and cost as many as 90,000 American jobs . $222 billion+ in green energy tax credits and $42 billion in subsidies for the rich through green energy tax credits for electric vehicles for which Americans making over $450K a year could qualify.

A five-page memo outlined $2.9 trillion in tax increases proposed by House Ways and Means Democrats, the largest increase in decades. About $1 trillion will come from high-income Americans, Fortune reported . Democrats propose raising the top income tax rate for people making over $400,000 from 37 percent to 39.6 percent. The top capital gains rate would also be increased from 20 percent to 25 percent. There would be a 3 percent surtax on people with adjusted gross income over $5 million. Corporate tax rates would increase from 21 percent to 26.5 percent for businesses with income over $5 million. Small businesses with income below $400,000 would see their rate lower to 18 percent and all of those in between will have their rate remain the same, at 21 percent. The Democrat-led bill would make is harder for small businesses to keep their doors open and involves the federal government in local housing and zoning planning. The bill increases Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties by over 500 percent — up to $700,000 per violation — for small businesses that don’t abide by the vaccine mandate and increases penalties under the Fair Labor Standards Act by 900 percent. $3.6 billion on getting ex-cons jobs . $80 billion on public housing improvements, including to public housing authorities that are in substantial default and violated federal laws. $4.5 billion on a new grant program that injects the federal government into state and local planning and zoning. And there’s more... $5 billion for “environmental and climate justice” block grants via the Environmental Protection Agency. $200 million for the Presidio Trust in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district, some of the priciest real estate in the country. The bill would stop drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, killing up to 130,000 American jobs and losing billions of barrels of oil. While Democrats say the bill will cost $3.5 trillion, that figure “is a phony number,” according to the Wall Street Journal editorial board . The spending plan is “full of delayed starts, phony phase-outs, and cost shifting to states designed to fit $3.5 trillion into a 10-year budget window that can pass with a mere 51 Senate votes,” the editors wrote. Democrats also say the $3.5 trillion will be paid for with $2.3 trillion of tax increases, $700 billion in savings from changing how Medicare and Medicaid buy pharmaceutical drugs and the rest would be paid for with future economic growth. Reason points out that federal government hasn't fully paid for its regular spending since 2001. The Congressional Budget Office projects that there isn’t a single year in the next 30 in which the budget will balance. There are massive public policy consequences from this legislation lasting decades. Maybe, Congress should consider passing legislation along bipartisan lines with 60 votes in the Senate.

Three letters that have taken over the headlines. You can’t understand the future of the internet as we head into the Web 3.0 era without understanding digital currencies and the means of value exchange. Enter NFTs, or as Elizabeth Strickler from Georgia State University says in her TEDx talk : The three letters that are changing digital experiences now. NFT stands for “non-fungible token” It’s essentially a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger such as a blockchain. You may have heard of forms of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin before. These are fungible tokens since one Bitcoin can be exchanged for another, just like one dollar can be exchanged for another dollar. NFTs, on the other hand, are not interchangeable, since each of them represents or links to a piece of digital media, whether that’s art, text, videos, or even bits of code. NFTs are typically released in drops, where a limited number of digital media are made available on an NFT marketplace for purchase. If the artist or creator has done a good job promoting their drop, the available items will be sold in minutes and then resold again on the secondary market for even more than their original value. Many brands have already made their first foray into the NFT world. Some of these brands are Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Stella Artois, The Economist, P&G, and many more. Beauty brands like Clinique , for example, launched their first NFTs with a focus on community and utility. Athletes and stars are also entering the space at a record pace, from Martha Stewart to Snoop Dog, Lionel Messi and Lindsay Lohan, and Tom Brady. Vogue Business captured it well. In a recent article , they mention NFTs evolving from being collectors’ items to include loyalty rewards and physical product perks, as brands find more purposeful brand uses of non-fungible tokens.

It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day. It has been troubling times for the country's biggest tech companies. Apple and Microsoft are scaling back production amid the global chip shortage. The House Judiciary Committee is wondering aloud if Amazon executives lied to Congress while under oath. Dozens of state attorney generals are pursuing Google on antitrust grounds. Facebook faces a brand new existential crisis seemingly every other day. And now, trust on Wall Street is waning. Faith No More The tech giants were riding high during much of the pandemic. On the surface, things appear to be going smoothly: Bloomberg Intelligence projects the cohort of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft — collectively known as FAAMG — to report combined profits of $67 billion in the third quarter, a 30% year-over-year increase roughly in-line with growth of the S&P 500. But as growth slows, optimism is diminishing. According to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s prime broker, hedge fund exposure to the big five tech companies is now at a two-year low, andi it isn't hard to see why: For each quarter through June 2022, the big five are expected to see profit growth stay behind the broad market: Analysts expect an 11 percentage point gap in the current period, the worst mark in nearly a half-decade. FAAMG stocks lost nearly $1 trillion in combined market value in September, and have yet to climb back to their peaks — even as the S&P 500 sits steady near all-time highs. Interest-ing Factor: Interest rates are rising, which means smaller companies will suffer, right? Not so, says a new study being circulated by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Lower interest rates helped the big five grow much faster than smaller firms, while high rates may see a competitive rebalancing, the study shows — yet another reason for hedge fund caution. Oh, Snap!: Snap, the plucky little sibling of FAAMG stocks, reported a revenue miss in its third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, placing the blame on new iOS privacy changes that are disrupting the digital ad agencies. The bad news for Snap was a warning sign for Facebook and Google — and sparked a sell-off in both ad-dependent firms.",

Tmall Singles’ Day, China’s annual shopping phenomenon makes a return this year with new products and services to re-energize consumers’ appetite. In 2020, the Chinese e-commerce platform raked in $74 billion in Gross Merchandising Volume and is expected to achieve a sizeable revenue once again. Taking last year’s learnings powered by failproof livestreaming strategies and the new NFT (non-fungible token) trend, China is set to break another record success. Just shy of a month away from the cyber festival, Alibaba’s Tmall marketplace has kicked off its ‘Tmall Super Brand Day’. A mega-sale campaign driven to spotlight select brands for Chinese consumers, foreign brands flock towards the opportunity to cement their footprint in the lucrative China market and at the doorsteps of 1.4 billion consumers. Tmall Enters the Metaverse This year, Tmall launched a ‘Double 11 Metaverse Art Exhibition’ within its mobile app, presented by meta-human virtual idol Ayayi. Developed by Ranmai technology, the avatar is a hyper-realistic digitalized person who has an appearance comparable to a real human. With Chinese consumers increasing interest to engage with new technologies and flawless virtual idols, Ayayi has already amassed near 114,000 followers and attracted the attention of top luxury brands including Guerlain. The exhibition acts as a campaign leading up to the Double 11 event, showing eight limited collections from different brands in the form of NFTs, with British luxury label Burberry being a part of it. The NFTs are sold at affordable price points removing the barriers of entry to improve consumer acceptance and participation of the new digital art form. Burberry releases NFT collection in Mythical Games' Blanks Block Party. Burberry MORE FOR YOU ‘No Christmas Trees, No Christmas Trees’ Another Shortage May Be On The Way The Grocery Business Is Going To Get Much More Competitive Costco Addresses Supply Chain Pains By Chartering Their Own Ships Being a pioneer in innovative digital technology within the fashion realm, it comes as no surprise Burberry is involved. Having debuted luxury’s first-ever social retail store in Shenzhen equipped with social commerce and a gamified AR experience, the label this time has forayed into the blockchain scene. Previously, the brand partnered with Mythical Games and created a vinyl NFT toy of its signature Sharky B character clad in Burberry’s monogram print, and sold out all 750 NFT units within 30 seconds. The brand participates in Tmall's Metaverse Art Exhibition, releasing only 1000 units of its NFT. Tmall For Singles’ Day, Burberry unveiled a 3D animation of its deer mascot. Users can interact with the digital piece, clicking into the museum gallery to view the deer donning a Burberry scarf. As per the gallery’s description, the design concept of the NFT was ideated from Ayayi’s friendship with Burberry’s deer, who plays the part of being her fashion advisor. In promotion of Singles Day, Burberry will be launching 1000 units of the deer NFT with a limited-edition scarf at RMB2900 ($454). Each with a unique identifier, the piece is guaranteed to be one-of-a-kind. Upon purchase, buyers will also receive the scarf physically and can access their NFT collection within an Alipay mini program. As of current, Tmall only accepts a RMB100 deposit before the piece is open for sale on November 11. Purchase of an NFT comes with a limited-edition Burberry scarf in celebration of Double 11 sales ... [+] season. Tmall Trading NFT’s in Crypto-less China Since May, China’s central bank and the National Development and Reform Commission outlawed cryptocurrency mining and declared all transactions illegal. The June publication of Communist Party-owned People’s Daily stated that the NFT Market “can be hyped up, leading to chaos, while decentralisation may lead to security concerns.”. Despite so, China’s recent 14th Five-Year Plan which runs from 2021 to 2025 has pinpointed blockchain to be a key technology and priority in the build of its digital economy. The only digital currency currently legal for tender is China’s own digital yuan (e-CNY) pegged to the renminbi. However, even China’s largest technology players cannot disregard the NFT trend. Despite the ongoing crackdown on Big Tech firms in an attempt to regulate the financial market, this has not stopped the BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) trio from building their own semi-private blockchain infrastructure as a workaround of the system. The tokenless blockchain infrastructure is adapted in compliance with the local regulatory environment, further monitored by a selected group of members including government bodies. Alibaba has since launched its own NFT marketplace, inviting budding creatives to tokenise their intellectual property on its platform. However, users are unable to sell or transfer purchases without violating the nation’s financial law. While typically NFT transactions are bound with cryptocurrency, the tech giants have been able to decouple the digital currency by allowing consumers to make payments directly with Chinese yuan as paid through Alipay and WeChat pay. The Future of China’s NFT Landscape Among Chinese consumers, the ownership of an NFT is not to make money, but a status symbol for the new generation of Chinese who are well-versed in technology with an appreciation for the arts – valuing experiences and intangibles over the materialistic goods they are known for. Despite NFT trading being prohibited, China has shown innovative ways to bypass the ban with a unique blockchain system that does not require crypto to trade. For this, creators can continue to monetize their work and brands will leverage NFTs to generate engagement with new experiences. Many brands are also traversing the digital ledgers into tangible items as an extension of their engagement with the buyer in the real world. The connection between the virtual and real-world is no longer restricted within a game, a showcase of how society is evolving towards a hybrid metaverse future. Despite the stringent surveillance on cryptocurrency movements, the NFT market will still be rapidly developing with continued high valuation among the arts, gaming and investment field in China.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Stena Line's Irish sea ferry Stena Emba is loaded with freight and passengers in Liverpool, United ... [+] Kingdom. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images) Getty Images Ferry routes between the U.K. and European Union are seeing some dramatic retail sales rises, so much so that the ‘booze cruise’ is making a comeback, while new port stores are being built as a way to recoup losses from the Covid pandemic. It seems that a ‘ Brexit bounce ’ is a reality in some sectors. Both Sweden’s Stena Line and Denmark’s DFDS have reported growing interest in their new land and sea shopping facilities connected to Britain-EU ferry routes. This is thanks to duty-free pricing being reintroduced at the start of the year by British government, with sales uplifts becoming noticeable this summer after lockdowns started to be lifted . The biggest saving are on wine and spirits and tobacco where duties are heaviest. On routes between Ireland and Wales for example, Stena Line has seen a boom. In a statement, Stena Group said: “Early figures show the huge potential (of onboard shopping) to help the travel sector bounce back after the pandemic.” Spend per passenger in the company’s shops jumped by 400% in August 2021 versus August 2019, before the pandemic started. Saving of up to 50% are touted by the company. Stena Line’s Irish Sea trade director, Paul Grant, commented: “As our passengers start to return in large numbers, we are delighted to be in a position to offer them the added benefit of duty-free shopping for the first time in over 20 years.” The ‘booze cruise’—where consumers take round-trip ferry journeys from and back to their port of embarkation just to avail themselves of duty-free bargains when in international waters—also disappeared at the end of 1990s when intra-EU duty-free sales were banned. MORE FOR YOU ‘No Christmas Trees, No Christmas Trees’ Another Shortage May Be On The Way The Grocery Business Is Going To Get Much More Competitive Costco Addresses Supply Chain Pains By Chartering Their Own Ships Bargain shopping at sea With those bargains back again, Stena Line has reintroduced low-priced return tickets at just £10 for these cruise sailings across the Irish Sea, with Friday and Sunday sailings staring from 5 November. Without leaving the ferry, passengers can shop onboard with access to, for example, a 1-litre bottle of Jameson Irish whiskey for £15, a very popular choice; 1-litre of Hendricks gin for £21; and two 1-litre bottles of Absolut vodka for £16. Duty-free savings of up to 50% are tempting passengers in Dunkirk. DFDS Meanwhile, DFDS opened a new €290,000 duty-free store in Dunkirk port in France earlier this month to take advantage of duty-free demand, just as Stena did with a port store in Holyhead . The 7,500 square feet of retail space in the Dunkirk terminal building follows the August unveiling of a 12,000 square foot shopping space, the largest of any ferry on the English Channel on the company’s Côte D’Opale vessel. The Dunkirk duty-free port store is aimed at consumers looking to buy in bulk and expectations are high that volumes will be strong due to the substantial savings compared to U.K. local prices. DFDS believes that the new shop will add 140 million Danish krona ($22 million) in revenue for the company over the next five years and also help to drive tourism in the Calais and Dunkirk areas of northern France. DFDS believes that the ferry business is entering a “new era of cross-channel shopping.” Steve Newbery, commercial onboard director, for DFDS in the U.K. said: “We need to educate the passenger where there are real savings to be had. Perfume is already our biggest sales category but spirits, wines, beers and new categories like electronics will feature heavily. A consumer education process “Back in 1999 the English Channel business suffered a huge drop after the end of duty-free and took many, many years to recover. This new opportunity combined with higher limits (on allowances) is a real positive for the ferry industry.” Shopping spaces on DFDS's Côte D’Opale ship have been upgraded. DFDS DFDS—the market leader on the Dover, U.K. to France route running up to 54 sailings a day—recently surveyed passenger attitudes to duty free shopping. Newbery’s comment about passenger education reflects the finding that there is a lack of national awareness of the impact of Brexit. Just over one-third (35%) of respondents said they didn’t know anything about the changes to duty-free this year—though almost half (45%) said they always take advantage of travel discounts when available. The most popular products bought by those saying they avail themselves of duty-free bargains are spirits (64%), beauty (61%) and wines (51%), with the majority of respondents spending between £100 and £199 in a duty-free shop. The DFDS strategy, like Stena’s, is to encourage the purchase of more premium, higher-priced products on board its ships through trading up, while bulk buying of standard lines is being shifted more to port shops.",

BEIRUT, Oct 25 — The Lebanese foreign minister said yesterday that negotiations with the International Monetary Fund would likely start in November, Lebanon’s Al Jadeed TV reported.Economy Minister Amin Salam had said on Friday in an interview with Reuters that the new government aimed to make progress towards starting full negotiations for an IMF deal by the end of this year or early next but was not expecting funds to be dispersed before elections in March.Lebanon is experiencing its worst-ever financial crisis and an IMF deal is widely seen as the only way for it to secure aid.Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib also spoke about the maritime border dispute between Lebanon and Israel, telling Al Jadeed that he was “optimistic about reaching an agreement”.The two countries are in a dispute over the delineation of their territorial waters and negotiations could lead to Lebanon being able to unlock valuable gas reserves.They have been holding on-and-off US-mediated talks to try to resolve the issue.Bou Habib also said the Iranian nuclear negotiations have an impact on Lebanon.He added that talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia “will reflect positively” on Lebanon.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said in Beirut earlier this month that the talks between Tehran and Riyadh aimed at reducing tensions have gone a “good distance”.Iran and Saudi Arabia, the leading Shi’ite and Sunni Muslim powers in the Middle East, have been rivals for years and cut diplomatic ties in 2016.Bou Habib said there was no close relationship with Saudi Arabia at the moment. “Improving the relationship isn’t in our hands.”Saudi Arabia, which once spent heavily in Lebanon, has shunned it for years because of Iran-backed Shi’ite Hezbollah’s influence in Lebanese affairs. — Reuters",

    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared what he believes to be the most important dogecoin improvements. He also clarified that he does not have anything to do with the Dogecoin Foundation and is not investing in the shiba inu (SHIB) token. Musk confirmed that he is only holding three cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk on Dogecoin Improvements, Shiba Inu Token Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk made several tweets about cryptocurrency, bitcoin, dogecoin, and the shiba inu token Sunday. Regarding Dogecoin’s improvements, he was asked whether he had any recent interactions with the Doge development team. While admitting that he had not interacted with them lately, Musk shared: What matters imo is lowering fees, decreasing block time & increasing block size. A single layer network with exchanges as de facto layer 2 seems like the simplest solution for a medium of exchange. Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus chimed in and responded to Musk’s Doge improvement tweet. He stressed that in his opinion, “dogecoin being fast, scalable, and inexpensive to send around is all it needs to be,” adding that “it doesn’t need to be yet another blockchain that hosts NFTs or other tokens or whatever.” Musk replied with a “hundred points” symbol. Furthermore, Musk responded to another Doge supporter who asked: “Do you think if Dogecoin accomplishes the goals you put forth here then it could be more practical and efficient than something like the Lightning Network as a medium of exchange?” The Tesla executive answered: “Possibly. Bitcoin was conceived at a time of relatively low bandwidth & high latency. If both continue to improve substantially, we will reach a point when no second layer is needed.” In August, Musk agreed with the billionaire owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, that “The community for doge is the strongest when it comes to using it as a medium of exchange.” Musk also clarified Sunday that he does not have anything to do with the Dogecoin Foundation in response to a comment on Twitter stating: “Jared Birchall represents Elon Musk, but as all advisors he has no direct voting rights. This guarantees the foundation stays independent while taking advantage of the expertise of shibes like Elon.” The Spacex CEO wrote: Neither Jared, nor me, nor anyone I know has anything to do with this foundation. The Dogecoin Foundation relaunched in August. Its website lists Jared Birchall as one of its four board advisors, describing him as a “legal & financial advisor” to Musk. Other board advisors include Markus and Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. Musk was asked how much shiba inu (SHIB) he is holding. The Tesla technoking simply replied, “None.” Besides SHIB, Musk was asked whether he had holdings in several other cryptocurrencies, including FLOKI, the token named after his shiba inu puppy. Instead of responding about each coin, Musk confirmed that he only owned bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin. “Out of curiosity, I acquired some ASCII hash strings called ‘Bitcoin, Ethereum & Doge.’ That’s it,” he affirmed. “As I’ve said before, don’t bet the farm on crypto. True value is building products & providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form.” Musk previously said that his companies, Spacex and Tesla, only owned bitcoin. The electric car company released its Q3 earnings report this week showing $1.26 billion in BTC. What do you think about Elon Musk’s tweets? Let us know in the comments section below.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Eternals cr: Marvel Studios Chloe Zhao’s newest film, Eternals , has grand ambitions (to put it mildly). It literally gives our planet’s origin story, introduces us to literal gods, and retcons the history of human civilization before our eyes. Ultimately it is a big swing of a film (the biggest swing in the history of the MCU) with a lot to accomplish in its runtime, and that alone is no mean feat for any filmmaker. While much in Eternals is accomplished skillfully it’s ultimately a messy, inconsistent affair. Long ago, a massively powerful race of beings called the Celestials created immortal beings named Eternals, sending them across the universe to protect species from the Deviants, a dangerous race of interstellar predators. A group of Eternals lived amongst humanity, forbidden from intervening in any crisis that isn’t Deviant related until that’s challenged and they have to fight for humanity’s future. Among the Eternals are Sersi (Gemma Chan), who can change matter; Ikaris (Richard Madden), who can shoot powerful eye-beams, fly, and is quite strong; Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) with the power of finger guns (he can shoot blasts via his hands); the inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry); mind-controller Druig (Barry Keoghan); the strong warrior Gilgamesh (Don Lee); and more. Conceptually, it’s perhaps Marvel’s biggest story in terms of raw scale in that it boasts the largest MCU worldbuilding outside of Shang-Chi and the Thor franchise at its very best. At the same time, the success of the worldbuilding is unfortunately rather hit-or-miss. It has an unenviable amount to accomplish within a reasonable length, but much of that worldbuilding is achieved through massive, sudden exposition dumps in ways that make it needlessly confusing at times and oddly paced in others. The entire first hour feels like a series of said clunky information dumps followed by a casual scene of Eternals walking around, followed by another information dump, rinse and repeat. The latter half of the film has much better pacing, but one can’t help to wish that the massive amount of information was paced out in a more streamlined, gradual way. Visually, the film is a treat with great effects and action choreography, adept production design, and lovely cinematography choices. The Celestials themselves are pictured in an appropriately menacing way, and the massive grandeur and power comes across. At the same time, the Deviants leave something to be desired in design, with the colorful, sinewy design losing some of the menace that intergalactic apex predators should have. The performances are unsurprisingly exceptional (you have cast like Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie, of course they’re incredible), but some of the strongest performances in the cast are not who you’d expect. Barry Keoghan’s struggles with Eternal inactivity in the face of human suffering is subtle but excellent emotional work. Brian Tyree Henry’s struggle with the complex legacy of intervention in human affairs is also a high point, while Kumail Nanjiani steals every scene he’s in. (Shout out to Don Lee as well for making Gilgamesh such a charmingly gleeful warrior badass). MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge At the same time, some characters are inexplicably removed from the central plot for clearly contrived plot reason. In advance of one key conflict scene, Kingo just… leaves, for no real reason at all? And Jolie’s Thena is routinely taken out of the film in the first half because she becomes a glass-eyed war berserker for reasons that are explained but never feel like anything other than an inconsistent plot contrivance… she’s genuinely just pulled from the action repeatedly in the first half and then suddenly is just fine exactly when she needs to be. Moreover, the film is at its strongest when the characters are musing about their role in human civilization, but that too is inconsistent... they defend their inaction against non-Deviant threats via claiming they were commanded not to interfere, but is Sersi facilitating agriculture and Phastos making a plot not intervening? And there’s a line about how warfare is allowed because it facilitates medical technology which ultimately saves lives, but why not just facilitate improved medical technology as a bigger net gain? From a purely conceptual level, most of the big picture concepts hold less rhetorical water the longer one thinks about them. Altogether, Eternals isn’t a bad film. The A-list cast produces many genuinely moving scenes, the action sequences largely land, the effects are great, and it opens up the cosmic side of the Marvel universe with major, massive brushstrokes. At the same time, there a number of clear plot contrivances, moments of clunky exposition, and sections of odd pacing that severely hamper it’s potential. It’s certainly worth seeing for some stunning performances, intriguing intellectual groundwork, and to see the future of the MCU, but the bright lights can’t outshine the parts that don’t work.",

Schools will reopen and small businesses will be revived, he said.The country will announce details on easing social distancing rules for gradual return to normal life on Oct. 29 after holding a public hearing on Monday.Inner Mongolia County Tells People to Stay Indoors (8:18 a.m. HK)Ejina, a county in western Inner Mongolia, asked all residents and travelers to stay indoors starting Monday to contain the spread of coronavirus, the local government said in a statement on Sunday.Ed Sheeran Tests Positive (2:17 p.m. NY)U.K. pop star Ed Sheeran told fans he’s tested positive and will perform and do interviews from home. “I’m now self-isolating and following government guidelines,” Sheeran, 30, wrote on Instagram.Florida Surgeon General Refused to Wear Mask (1:57 p.m. NY)Florida’s new surgeon general refused to wear a mask offered to him by a state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition -- and she ultimately asked him to leave her office. The encounter, earlier reported by Florida Politics, took place between Senator Tina Polsky and Joseph Ladapo, who met her in her office regarding his upcoming confirmation after being appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. “He’s very smug,” Polsky said. “And I told him several times, ‘I have this very serious medical condition.’ And he said, ‘That’s OK,’ like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.’”Ladapo has questioned the vaccine’s efficacy and safety, and like DeSantis, opposes shot mandates. Florida was hit hard by the latest wave of the virus, accounting at one point for a fifth of U.S. cases. Pediatricians Should Vaccinate Kids, Gottlieb Says (1:09 p.m. NY)Children ages 5 to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician’s offices, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He’s a board member of Pfizer Inc., whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children. “Getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “You don’t want children to have to go to mass vaccination sites or even necessarily a pharmacy. You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician’s office.”He said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors’ offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.”His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don’t support a move to harsher restrictions. Speaking against a backdrop of rising virus cases and ahead of his budget this week, Sunak said a return to the furlough program that saw the government pay as much as 80% of the wages of idled workers was not on the cards. “We don’t envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year.”Malaysia Sees Further Drop in Cases (4:49 p.m. HK)Malaysia recorded the fewest cases since the end of June. The Southeast Asian country added 5,666 new infections Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to more than 2.43 million, according to a tweet by Health Malaysia Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah. Meanwhile, almost 95% of Malaysia’s adult population have received a complete dose of vaccines, according to the health ministry’s data.Russia Deaths, Cases Remain Near Record (4:17 p.m. HK)Russian coronavirus cases and deaths remained near record levels on Sunday ahead of the implementation of strict nationwide curbs to stem a surge in infections.There were 35,660 new cases and 1,072 deaths over the past day, slightly below records set Saturday, according to data from the national coronavirus headquarters. Last week, President Vladimir Putin ordered nationwide non-working days for the first week of November to slow the spread, while Moscow will be closed for most business from Oct. 28 through Nov. 7.China Expects Outbreak to Widen (4:08 p.m. HK)China’s new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the pandemic may continue to expand.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday. The outbreak has expanded to 11 provinces in the week since Oct. 17, Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission, said at the same briefing.Earlier on Sunday, Beijing authorities announced the city is halting cross-province tourism and closing card and majhong rooms. China’s capital will also cut the number of large events and increase supervision over small clinics and pharmacies, according to the official WeChat account of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.Belgium to Weigh Stricter Rules (3:21 p.m. HK)Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will meet with his cabinet Monday to discuss the virus situation and consider tighter curbs. The government is mulling a return to stricter mask rules, Belga reports, citing a government spokesman. Belgium, like other European countries, is seeing rising infections, with more than 8.5 million of a population of about 11.5 million being fully vaccinated. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.With assistance from Bloomberg.

[+] quarter in the game at Nissan Stadium on Oct. 24, 2021. (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images) Getty Images The Kansas City Chiefs contained Derrick Henry, limiting the NFL’s leading rusher to 3.0 yards a carry (86 yards on 29 carries). That was the only good news against the Tennessee Titans. Everything else seemingly went wrong for the Chiefs in the 27-3 loss to Tennessee. That Murphy’s Law certainly applies to the overhauled offensive line, which starts five new players this season and had been playing well. But against the Titans, the Chiefs allowed four sacks, and Patrick Mahomes was hit nine times. “We came in, knowing that it was a good defensive front,” head coach Andy Reid said, “and you want to stay out of third and longs.” The breakdowns along the offensive line were reminiscent of Super Bowl LV — when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers sacked Mahomes three times and hit him eight times — and prevented the Chiefs from taking advantage of the Titans’ injury-ravaged secondary. The most worrisome gaffe occurred on a 4 th -and-18 play with 8:24 left in the game. Defensive linemen Jeffery Simmons and Denico Autry converged on Mahomes, hitting him and forcing him to exit the contest. Mahomes cleared concussion protocol, but Reid chose to keep him out for the rest of the game. “I feel fine now,” Mahomes said. “Y’all saw the hit. I mean, I kind took my time getting up, but I felt fine.” MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers Mahomes, who has been pressing all year, committed two costly errors. But the offensive line played a role in both. On the Chiefs’ second possession of the second quarter, Mahomes was picked by linebacker Rashaan Evans for the quarterback’s ninth interception of the season. He forced the throw in part due to interior pressure. On the next drive and with just 1:56 left in the half, the pocket collapsed, forcing Mahomes to scramble. Safety Kevin Byard hit him, forcing a fumble recovered by safety Matthias Farley. The offensive line struggled from the get-go. On the Chiefs’ opening drive, their most consistent lineman Joe Thuney, who was signed to a lucrative five-year, $80 million contract that makes him the second-highest paid guard in the league and has been playing with a broken hand, committed a false start. Two plays later left tackle Orlando Brown allowed Bud Dupree’s first sack of the year. Brown, who the Chiefs acquired in a trade before the draft presuming they would sign him to a long-term deal , had his worst game as a Chief. In the fourth quarter on 3rd and 8, linebacker Ola Adeniyi got past him. Three plays later, he allowed a sack by Harold Landry on a play in which Dupree also beat Mike Remmers, who replaced Lucas Niang in the starting lineup at right tackle, the previous week. Remmers also committed a costly hands-to-the-face penalty that wiped out a Tyreek Hill catch on the play prior to Mahomes’ fumble. Rookie right guard Trey Smith, who had been one of the best values in the NFL , also struggled with penalties and protection. On the Chiefs’ last drive of the third quarter, the sixth-round pick and final selection of the Chiefs’ 2021 draft class, committed a hold on first down. On third down of that drive, he was partly responsible for a sack by Autry, forcing the Chiefs to settle for a 57-yard, field-goal attempt, which Harrison Butker missed. It was all part of a dismal performance in which the Chiefs were never competitive. The Chiefs didn’t covert a third down and had the ball for just six minutes and 44 seconds in the first half. They also allowed quarterback Ryan Tannehill to complete his first 11 passes. With the Chiefs falling to 3-4 and the offensive line having their worst performance since Super Bowl LV, Kansas City is experiencing the kind of adversity that has been rare in the Mahomes Era. “It’s been kind of rainbows and flowers and awesome for these last few years,” Mahomes said. “But whenever you want to build something substantial and you want to build something great, you’re going to go through parts like this.”",

    "full_description": "Seniors receiving Social Security checks are entitled to periodic benefit increases called Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs). These COLAs are critical to ensure retirees don't lose buying power as prices rise over time due to inflation. In recent years, however, the COLAs have been very small. That's all changing in 2022, though, as this year's benefit increase is more than four times higher than the average in recent years. Image source: Getty Images. Retirees will get their most generous raise in decades Over the past 12 years, Social Security's cost of living adjustments have been meager. In fact, they've averaged just 1.38%. And, as the table below detailing past COLAs shows, in some years retirees haven't received any Social Security benefits increase at all . Year COLA January 2021 1.3% January 2020 1.6% January 2019 2.8% January 2018 2.00% January 2017 0.3% January 2016 0% January 2015 1.7% January 2014 1.5% January 2013 1.7% January 2012 3.6% January 2011 0% January 2010 0% Table source: Social Security Administration. In 2022, however, the newly announced COLA dwarfs the meager raises retirees have received for more than a decade. Seniors will be getting a 5.9% benefit increase in 2022, which is the largest increase since 1982. The reason the COLA dwarfs recent past raises is because inflation is so much higher than it has been recently. See, COLAs are calculated using a very specific method. The annual Social Security raise is determined based on how much prices have risen year over year as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W showed massive inflation this year, with prices spiking in key areas. When costs rise, if Social Security benefits didn't increase, seniors would end up losing buying power. Eventually, benefits wouldn't be worth much at all and retirees would find themselves struggling to afford basic necessities. COLAs are intended to help ensure that doesn't end up happening. Unfortunately, the low COLAs in recent years may actually not have been high enough to help retirees avoid losing ground. That's because the composition of goods and services that makes up CPI-W doesn't perfectly mirror the spending habits of retirees who have different needs than urban wage earners and clerical workers. Retirees tend to spend less on things like entertainment while a larger percentage of their money goes toward medical and housing expenses. Benefits have actually seen a 30% reduction in value over the past two decades because of this. And while it would be nice to think that a 5.9% COLA in 2022 will help retirees make up for some of the buying power they've lost, the reality is that even with such a large raise, it still may not reflect the real rise in prices older Americans experience. Still, the fact that seniors will see more money in their checks next year can help with budgeting since they'll at least be bringing home more cash to spend -- even if it doesn't go as far. Retirees should take advantage of the extra benefits by reworking their budgets to ensure they are making the most of the additional money that will start showing up in their checks in 2022.",

    "content": "While the African continent is generally viewed as one of the most ideally placed to embrace and fully exploit the blockchain, the reality on the ground suggests otherwise. The East Africa Blockchain Expedition As Adedayo Adebajo, the managing director of Jelurida Africa and a blockchain enthusiast told Bitcoin.com News, much of the focus in terms of investment has been on two regions, Southern and West Africa. Adebajo suggests in written responses to questions sent to Bitcoin.com News that the East Africa region is being left behind. Therefore, to correct this anomaly, Adebajo has organized the East Africa Blockchain Expedition, an education and awareness campaign that will see him tour several African countries. This expedition, which commenced on October 23, is set to run for 30 days. To learn more about this expedition as well as its objectives, Bitcoin.com News sent questions Adebajo, and below are his responses. Bitcoin.com News (BCN): Can you explain in brief what this blockchain expedition is all about? Adedayo Adebajo (AA): The blockchain expedition is a journey across East African countries that seeks to educate, train, create communities and then showcase areas where blockchain technology is already being used in the zone. The intention is to increase developer’s communities, encourage more adoption and enhance public and private knowledge especially in areas where blockchain technology can help businesses and standards. BCN: What prompted you to do this? AA: The main activator was the open statement by the President of Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan encouraging the banks and other sectors to look into blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. It was an open invitation considering Tanzania’s position in the East African region. This is an opportunity that evangelists and stakeholders like me have been waiting for. Taking the awareness campaign to another level of all-around engagement. I believe now is the perfect time to educate more people and by so doing foster more adoption. BCN: Why East Africa and are there plans to do this in other parts of the continent? AA: I guess everyone is always on the lookout for opportunities. While most will seek greener pastures that enable them to scale easily, I’m more of a pathfinder and pacesetter creating opportunities where others might consider a crazy journey. The focus of most tech giants is mostly in Western and Southern Africa and that has got to change. You’d be amazed at the amount of tech genius present in East Africa that the rest of the world didn’t know about. So my expedition is set to commence from the East and as a reference point to the rest of the continent. BCN: What do you hope to see after this expedition has ended? AA: By the end of the expedition, I hope to have: Gathered hundreds of thousands of communities across the region to continue spreading the awareness, The backing of specific public offices after having technology-focused interactions that foster a dynamic and startup-friendly regulatory framework for blockchain technology. Successfully convinced and planted a seed for mass adoption in the private and public sectors. Increase the blockchain developer’s community by hundreds. BCN: Charles Hoskinson, the creator of the Cardano blockchain, has seemingly identified Africa as the most ideal market for the blockchain and is currently touring the continent. On the other hand, the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey has in the past tweeted about the potential of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in African countries like Nigeria. Why do think influential people like Hoskinson or Dorsey are repeatedly highlighting the blockchain’s potential in Africa? AA: I see them basically as investors, and like any other person that sees the potential in the population and the need for decentralized solutions. Africa despite the numerous resources, likes of which isn’t possessed by the other part of the world is still considered poor and underdeveloped. These are great enough potentials for decentralized technologies to scale and any investor would see that. BCN: Do you agree that the blockchain can potentially be more useful in Africa than in North America or Europe? AA: As earlier mentioned, we have the population and resources, what we lack in the journey of becoming the most sought-after continent is proper utilization and allocation using these emerging technologies such as blockchain. If adopted and deployed in the right sectors and used, it (blockchain) will foster fast developments across the continent allowing us to compete with other developed continents. BCN: Do you think that African governments fully understand the blockchain and what it can do? AA: With respect to what the African government understands, I will say not enough. Most of the people in the seat of power aren’t from the new generation. Most are from the analog age who still see value in using a typewriter rather than printing, then some are from the intermediate generations. The adoption and embracement of these 4IR technologies would have been increasing if the government understood it and fully understand its potentials. Do you agree with Adebajo’s idea of raising awareness about the blockchain in East Africa? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.",

Adedayo Adebajo (AA) : The blockchain expedition is a journey across East African countries that seeks to educate, train, create communities and then showcase areas where blockchain technology is already being used in the zone. The intention is to increase developer’s communities, encourage more adoption and enhance public and private knowledge especially in areas where blockchain technology can help businesses and standards. BCN: What prompted you to do this? AA : The main activator was the open statement by the President of Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan encouraging the banks and other sectors to look into blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. It was an open invitation considering Tanzania’s position in the East African region. This is an opportunity that evangelists and stakeholders like me have been waiting for. Taking the awareness campaign to another level of all-around engagement. I believe now is the perfect time to educate more people and by so doing foster more adoption. BCN: Why East Africa and are there plans to do this in other parts of the continent? AA : I guess everyone is always on the lookout for opportunities. While most will seek greener pastures that enable them to scale easily, I’m more of a pathfinder and pacesetter creating opportunities where others might consider a crazy journey. The focus of most tech giants is mostly in Western and Southern Africa and that has got to change. You’d be amazed at the amount of tech genius present in East Africa that the rest of the world didn’t know about. So my expedition is set to commence from the East and as a reference point to the rest of the continent. BCN: What do you hope to see after this expedition has ended? AA : By the end of the expedition, I hope to have: Gathered hundreds of thousands of communities across the region to continue spreading the awareness, The backing of specific public offices after having technology-focused interactions that foster a dynamic and startup-friendly regulatory framework for blockchain technology. Successfully convinced and planted a seed for mass adoption in the private and public sectors. Increase the blockchain developer’s community by hundreds. BCN: Charles Hoskinson, the creator of the Cardano blockchain, has seemingly identified Africa as the most ideal market for the blockchain and is currently touring the continent. On the other hand, the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey has in the past tweeted about the potential of blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in African countries like Nigeria. Why do think influential people like Hoskinson or Dorsey are repeatedly highlighting the blockchain’s potential in Africa? AA : I see them basically as investors, and like any other person that sees the potential in the population and the need for decentralized solutions. Africa despite the numerous resources, likes of which isn’t possessed by the other part of the world is still considered poor and underdeveloped. These are great enough potentials for decentralized technologies to scale and any investor would see that. BCN: Do you agree that the blockchain can potentially be more useful in Africa than in North America or Europe? AA : As earlier mentioned, we have the population and resources, what we lack in the journey of becoming the most sought-after continent is proper utilization and allocation using these emerging technologies such as blockchain. If adopted and deployed in the right sectors and used, it (blockchain) will foster fast developments across the continent allowing us to compete with other developed continents. BCN: Do you think that African governments fully understand the blockchain and what it can do? AA : With respect to what the African government understands, I will say not enough. Most of the people in the seat of power aren’t from the new generation. Most are from the analog age who still see value in using a typewriter rather than printing, then some are from the intermediate generations. The adoption and embracement of these 4IR technologies would have been increasing if the government understood it and fully understand its potentials. Do you agree with Adebajo’s idea of raising awareness about the blockchain in East Africa? Tell us what you think in the comments section below.

[+] provided by The Sports Seoul, Aespa attends the 30th High1 Seoul Music Awards on January 31, 2021 in Seoul, South Korea. (Photo by The Sports Seoul via Getty Images) Getty Images South Korean girl group Aespa started releasing music less than a full year ago, but they have already experienced success far beyond the borders of their home country. In fact, this week, the still-new band appears on a number of Billboard charts for the first time, with their debut collection becoming not just a massive and important win for the quartet, but among all female acts from their nation. Aespa’s debut set Savage opens at No. 2 on this week’s Top Album Sales chart, Billboard ’s look at the 100 titles that actually sold the most copies in the U.S. The EP sold nearly 17,500 copies in its first frame of availability (according to information shared by MRC Data), which is enough to put it in second place on the purchase-only list. The K-pop outfit comes in behind only Don Toliver’s Life of a Don , which wins the week by fewer than 1,000 copies. Simply by appearing inside the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart, Aespa makes history and becomes only the fourth South Korean girl group to break into the highest tier on the tally. They join Blackpink, Twice and Itzy in this feat, which remains out of reach for many of the biggest names from the K-pop capital.

The four-member vocal troupe’s debut full-length The Album went right to No. 1 a year ago, and before that, their EP Kill This Love rose as high as No. 10. They remain the only K-pop girl group to break into the area more than once, at least for now.

Earlier this month, Itzy became the third South Korean girl group to land a top 10 bestselling album in America, as their full-length Crazy in Love also conquered the list, arriving at No. 1. On the Billboard 200, Savage starts at No. 20, quickly becoming one of the most successful releases in U.S. history by a South Korean girl group. The more-closely-watched ranking is compiled using sales and streaming activity in an effort to paint a picture of what Americans are consuming, not just buying.

Adshares ($ADS) decentralized network working since 2017, created the possibility to connect Publishers and Advertisers directly with the use of blockchain and allows them to sign advertising contracts without intermediaries. The Adshares team is constantly putting in a lot of effort to grow their ecosystem which shows that Adshares is considered one of the biggest players in the decentralized ad network market in the world for a reason. This is well illustrated by the number of impressions of their ads, which surpassed 200 million per month. Metaverse is a concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared 3D visual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe. The metaverse in a broader sense may not only refer to virtual worlds, but the Internet as a whole, including the entire spectrum of augmented reality. Metaverse is just a big evolution of physical reality, augmented reality and virtual reality all combined into one creation. Lots of big companies invest in metaverse, for example Facebook who launched Horizon Workroom which is a new way for office workers to connect using virtual reality and an Oculus headset which allows people to work from home and at the same time feel like in office with other colleagues who are using that as well. Adshare’s goal is to utilize NFTs in order to help projects with marketing in the Metaverse. “Adshares is the first 100% decentralized marketplace for programmable advertising, also being one of the most advanced blockchain-based projects in the advertising market. We use our own, unique blockchain to connect publishers and advertisers, allowing them to make direct deals. We currently have over 500 publishers and more are coming all the time! Using Adshares open source software, anyone can join the ecosystem and start their ad-related services in a just, transparent and egalitarian marketplace. Our vision for Adshares is to become the biggest decentralised marketing blockchain governed by DAO ” said CEO of Adshares, Krzysztof Bochenek. Ultimately Adshares wants to have their ads in the metaverse creations such as games, events, concerts and many more. Adshares aims to get rid of Google’s monopoly on the advertising market by allowing anyone to enter without a start-up fee. It also allows users to set at will the ads they want to be displayed without any restrictions and what is important for everyone, low fees which attracts users. Company wants to apply the same to the metaverse on an even larger scale than before. Adshares Web3 blockchain technology allows it to process 1.4 million transactions per second, which gives us the ability to compete with the aforementioned Google Ads. Adshares as a web3 solution for advertising Adshares as a decentralized web3 network wants to give people authority over their own ads.

Adshares isn’t only an interesting alternative for GoogleAds. Adshares technology is likely to become GoogleAds successor.

(Photo by Emilee Chinn/Getty Images) Getty Images Anti-vaccine protesters marched through Brooklyn to Barclays Center on Sunday where they chanted “Stand with Kyrie” outside the Nets home opener with the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday. According to video reports, some protesters jumped the barricades and pushed toward a main entrance, chanting “Let Kyrie play.” The crowd reportedly included a mix of protesters supporting various political causes and sides of the political spectrum. The Nets on Oct. 12 banned Irving from practicing or playing with the team until he either receives a Covid-19 vaccination or New York City regulations on the matter change.

He will still be paid for road games. Nets GM Sean Marks said then that Irving had essentially forced the Nets into this position. “Ultimately, yes,” he said. “He has a choice to make and he made his choice. And my job here is to make what we deem is the best choices for the organization moving ahead and as a whole. They’re not always ones that are going to be met with open arms and a thumbs up. These are hard decisions. “And just like I’m sure it wasn’t easy for Kyrie, either, to have to not be around his teammates.” Irving has reportedly taken his anti-vaccine stance to support others who have lost their jobs over vaccine mandates. “Kyrie wants to be a voice for the voiceless,” one source told The Athletic. Irving has given no indication whether he might get vaccinated or what his timetable is. Meantime, Nets owner Joe Tsai Team recently said the team has “moved on” from Irving. “This season we have unfinished business,” Tsai said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference on Digital Transformation of Sports, according to the New York Post . “We all know how last season ended. We feel like our collective goal is to go for a championship this season. “I respect individual choice. But when individual action is not consistent with the collective goal, the team has to move on. And that’s what we’ve done. For me, as the owner, it’s the only fair thing to do for our fans, our players, our coaching staff, everyone involved in our organization. It’s the only fair thing to do.”",

The market-leading cryptocurrency's price per token has surged roughly 113% year to date even with some recent pullback after hitting a new lifetime high of roughly $67,000 per token. Bitcoin appears to be gaining traction as \"digital gold\" and as a potential safe haven at a time when inflation and other factors are casting uncertainty over equities markets. As impressive as the crypto token's performance has been, a panel of Motley Fool contributors has identified three cryptocurrencies they believe are primed to deliver better performance from here on out. Read on to see why they think Ethereum ( CRYPTO:ETH ) , Cardano ( CRYPTO:ADA ) , and Solana ( CRYPTO:SOL ) offer superior opportunities for investors. Image source: Getty Images. Crypto's second-biggest player could be a better bet Keith Noonan (Ethereum): The Ethereum blockchain is rapidly gaining favor as a network for smart contracts and decentralized application development. With a market capitalization of roughly $469 billion, Ethereum stands as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Many fast-growing cryptocurrencies, trading platforms, and smart-contract services are built on top of Ethereum, and the network's Ether token looks poised to benefit from rising utility and surging valuations for crypto assets. Like Bitcoin, Ether has recently attracted attention as a speculative asset that could have explosive upside and a potential hedge against inflation and other destabilizing economic and market factors. There's a seemingly unusual combination of market forces helping to drive rallies for both crypto tokens. However, I think the long-term application building potential of the Ethereum network makes Ether a more attractive option for investors looking to benefit from the evolution of blockchain technologies. While Bitcoin has gained favor as a digital store of value, Ethereum's blockchain network has gained attention as a launching ground for innovative new applications and services. The decentralized computing platform could be a starting point for groundbreaking projects. Bitcoin's price per token may very well continue to climb higher and higher, but the superior utility offered by the Ethereum blockchain and its developer network lead me to think the Ether token is a more promising forward-looking bet. Ether's price per token has surged roughly 458% across 2021's trading. Despite significantly outpacing Bitcoin's gains across the stretch, I still think Ethereum stands a good chance of outperforming Bitcoin over the long term. This third-gen option solves previous crypto problems James Brumley (Cardano) : While Bitcoin has clearly been the poster child for the cryptocurrency movement -- particularly now that it has its own ETF -- the explosion of alternative digital money has thrust a major problem into the spotlight. That is, \"mining\" these things consumes a massive amount of electricity. Given how the green/renewable energy movement is going just as strong, this clearly creates a marketability problem. Cardano is an exception to this norm, however. It's kind of complicated, but here's the simple, condensed explanation: Bitcoin miners use their computer rigs to compete for the right to produce an eligible blockchain; this is the \"mining\" process you hear about. This is very energy intensive, as a mining computer must prove to all other miners that the calculations that have identified a newly found Bitcoin are legitimate. Cardano is different in that the energy-intensive mining process doesn't start by proving that the calculation work has been done. Rather, Cardano mining starts with stunningly simpler (although still secure) proof that the miner in question already owns a stake in Cardano. That miner then is randomly assigned the right to create a new digital coin. Not only does this process require less than 1% of the electricity needed to mine a bitcoin, Cardano's underlying tech makes it more interoperable. That just means it's more usable in more ways, and not stymied the way other cryptocurrencies' 24/7 networks are. If that's too much technical jargon, here's the quick and dirty explanation: Cardano is a true third-generation altcoin that was designed to sidestep flaws seen with first- and second-generation cryptos. The heart and SOL of DeFi Daniel Foelber (Solana): Solana has emerged as arguably the hottest altcoin on the market today. In the last six months alone, its price is up nearly five-fold and is hovering around an all-time high at the time of this writing. The triple constraint of blockchain is scalability, speed, and decentralization. It's impossible to have all three, as each currency compromises strengths in certain categories. For example, Bitcoin is very scalable and incredibly decentralized , but it is painfully slow. Its rigidity is its advantage , as its network is virtually impenetrable . Ethereum, by comparison, is somewhat in the middle of all three categories. It's not the fastest, the most scalable, or the most decentralized; but it's pretty good in all three categories . Solana is lightning fast, incredibly scalable, but fairly centralized. Similar to Ethereum, Solana has its own blockchain and is considered to have what's called a \"layer-1\" protocol. By comparison, tokens like Polygon are what's called \"layer-2\" scaling, meaning they are third-party integrations that run on top of a layer-1 blockchain. Polygon relies on the Ethereum blockchain to verify transactions, taking advantage of its decentralization in the process. Solana's uniqueness is that it's the fastest sizable layer-1 blockchain out there, all the while having low transaction fees. Its blockchain is currently processing between 1,000 and 2,000 transactions per second at an average cost per transaction of less than one-tenth of a penny. One of the reasons it has low transaction fees is because there are only around 1,100 validators helping run the Solana blockchain. This means that Solana is, theoretically, easier to hack. But it also means processing and verifying transactions on its blockchain are much faster compared to the over 10,000 nodes that are actively supporting the Bitcoin blockchain. Like anything with cryptocurrency, it's important to know what you're getting into and why you're getting into it . Solana is a much riskier investment than Ethereum, and magnitudes riskier than Bitcoin ; but its growth is something that's sure to appeal to risk-tolerant investors .",

[+] win over the Washington Football Team. ASSOCIATED PRESS Trap game? What trap game? Green Bay hosted Washington — one of the NFL’s most disappointing teams in 2021 — on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. And with games at Arizona and Kansas City on deck, many wondered if the Packers might take Washington for granted. Not a chance. “You can’t take anything for granted in this league,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said last week. “We know every game is a challenge in this league. Most of these games are decided by a couple plays, so if you have your focus anywhere else, you’re going to get beat.” The Packers were focused from the start, had most big plays go in their favor and defeated Washington, 24-10. Green Bay won its sixth straight game and improved to 6-1. Washington fell to 2-5. Here’s the good, bad and ugly from Green Bay’s victory. MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers THE GOOD RED ZONE: Green Bay entered the day with a legendarily awful red zone defense. Opponents had made 15 trips inside the Packers’ 20-yard line and scored touchdowns all 15 times. According to Elias Sports Bureau, no NFL team in at least 40 years had failed to come up with a single red zone stops in the first six games. Well, Green Bay’s brutal drought finally ended Sunday. Washington drove deep into Green Bay territory four times and came away with just a single field goal. On the first, quarterback Taylor Heinicke appeared to have a 3-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter that would have pulled Washington within 21-14. Instead, the play was reversed when it was ruled Heinicke gave himself up at the 1-yard line. On the following play — a fourth down run — Heinicke fumbled, recovered, but was stopped short of the goal line. On Washington’s next possession, it drove to Green Bay’s 3-yard line. On fourth down, though, Heinicke fired incomplete to tight end Ricky Seals-Jones who was blanketed by safety Adrian Amos. And on Washington’s third trip, Packers cornerback Chandon Sullivan had an interception. For one brief day, Packers much-maligned defensive coordinator Joe Barry — a failure in both Detroit and Washington — had his moment in the sun. ALLEN LAZARD: Green Bay’s wide receiver entered the day with just 10 catches for 124 yards this season. On Sunday, Lazard had five receptions for 60 yards and a touchdown. Lazard caught a 10-yard touchdown pass before halftime to give Green Bay a 14-7 lead. And after Lazard’s TD, the Packers never trailed again. AARON RODGERS: The Hall of Fame quarterback was incredibly sharp, completing 27-of-35 passes (79.4%) for 274 yards and three touchdowns. Rodgers threw touchdowns to Davante Adams, Lazard and Robert Tonyan and finished with a passer rating of 127.6. Green Bay’s offense — which ranked No. 1 in the NFL with 31.8 points a year ago — hasn’t been nearly as explosive and is averaging just 24.0 points per game this year. But Rodgers has been patient, is managing the game well and taking what defenses are giving him. That’s helped Green Bay post the NFC’s second-best record to date. THIS AND THAT: Outside linebacker Rashan Gary had a strip sack on the second play of the third quarter that was recovered by end Dean Lowry. That led to an Aaron Rodgers to Robert Tonyan touchdown pass three plays later that gave Green Bay a commanding 21-7 lead. … Packers inside linebacker De’Vondre Campbell forced a fourth down fumble on Washington quarterback Taylor Heinicke at the goal line. … Defensive end Dean Lowry had a sack and a fumble recovery. THE BAD PROTECTION ISSUES: Washington’s terrific defensive line made life tricky for the Packers’ offensive line all day. Defensive tackle Jonathan Allen had a pair of sacks — beating center Lucas Patrick once and guard Jon Runyan on another. And defensive end Montez Sweat beat Billy Turner for a sack. That marked the second straight game Green Bay has allowed three sacks. A.J. DILLON: Packers running back A.J. Dillon had a pair of fumbles. On the first, Packers center Lucas Patrick bailed Dillon out by recovering the fumble. On the second, Dillon wasn’t as fortunate as Washington safety Landon Collins recovered to set up a field goal. THE UGLY UNIFORMS: For more than a century, the Packers’ team colors have been dark green gold and white. They possess one of the most traditional looks in the NFL. On Sunday, the Packers wore what they called their “classic” uniforms which included yellow helmets over green jerseys, green pants and green socks. The uniforms resembled those worn by the University of Oregon. While the uniforms sold well to the general public, historic franchises like Green Bay don't need to deviate from the colors and uniforms that people have come to know. Marketing gimmicks and tricks might be needed in places like Jacksonville and Houston. Teams like the Packers shouldn't resort to such tomfoolery. KICKING GAME: Two weeks ago, Packers kicker Mason Crosby missed three field goal and an extra point. Some chalked it up to being “one of those days”, but it’s clearly more than that. Crosby had a 34-yard field goal blocked in the second quarter when he failed to get much loft on the kick. Crosby later had an extra point that hit the upright and bounced through. Crosby is now just 11-of-15 on field goals this season and his 73.3% would be the second-lowest of his career. And what’s worse? The weather will get much nastier over the next two-plus months.",

This statement is probably even more true after last week's news that sent shares on a roller-coaster of a ride, up and then down. On Wednesday, reports came out that financial tech giant PayPal ( NASDAQ:PYPL ) is in late-stage talks to acquire Pinterest at about $70 per share. If these reports prove true, that would be good news for investors who bought Pinterest stock before late 2020, as it traded below that level up until then. For context, Pinterest stock closed at $58.06 on Friday. On Friday, Pinterest and other social media stocks dropped following Snap 's release of its third-quarter results . The owner of the Snapchat messaging app reported revenue and revenue guidance that were weaker than Wall Street was expecting. The company said Apple 's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) privacy changes related to advertising on mobile apps hurt its revenue. Investors are concerned that a similar dynamic occurred with Pinterest. In 2021, Pinterest stock is down 11.9% through Friday, trailing the S&P 500 's 22.4% return. Despite being 35% off its all-time high, set in February, it's still a big winner since 2020, when the pandemic-driven surge in users powered it to a 254% gain. Since Jan. 1, 2020, shares are up 212%, compared with the broader market's 45% return. Here's what to watch in Pinterest's Q3 report. Image source: Getty Images. Pinterest's key numbers Following are the company's results from Q3 2020, its Q3 2021 guidance, and Wall Street's consensus estimates to use as benchmarks. Metric Q3 2020 Result Pinterest's Q3 2021 Guidance Wall Street's Q3 2021 Consensus Estimate Wall Street's Projected Change (YOY) Revenue $442.6 million Growth in the low 40-percentage range $631.2 million 43% Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) $0.13 N/A $0.23 77% Data sources: Pinterest and Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year. Note: Pinterest didn't issue earnings guidance. For context, in the second quarter, Pinterest's revenue surged 125% year over year to $613.2 million. That result sped by Wall Street's consensus estimate of $561.9 million as well as the company's guidance of 105% growth. Adjusted net income was $169.9 million, or $0.25 per share, up from an adjusted loss of $38.4 million, or $0.07 per share, in the year-ago period. That result was nearly double the $0.13 per share analysts had been expecting. Shares fell more than 18% the day after the release, despite the upside surprises on the top and bottom lines, and third-quarter revenue guidance that also was higher than widely expected. The culprit was U.S. user growth that fell short of management's guidance. Key user stats Management didn't provide guidance for Q3 monthly active users (MAUs), citing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. However, last quarter's earnings release did say: \"Engagement headwinds on Pinterest have continued in July. As of July 27, 2021, U.S. MAUs have declined approximately 7% and global MAUs have grown approximately 5% year over year.\" Pinterest's revenue is determined by two metrics: the number of global MAUs and global average revenue per user (ARPU), which reflects the advertising rates it achieved. Last quarter, global MAUs rose 9% year over year to 454 million, and global ARPU soared 89% to $1.32. \"What spooked many investors was U.S. MAUs falling 5% year over year to 91 million,\" as I previously wrote . \"Pinterest had guided for U.S. MAUs to be roughly flat with the year-ago period.\" Fourth-quarter guidance The market looks ahead, so Pinterest's guidance could be even more important than its third-quarter results relative to moving its stock. For the fourth quarter, analysts are modeling for Pinterest's revenue to increase 24% year over year to $876.7 million and its adjusted EPS to rise 9.3% to $0.47. Focus on the long term Long-term investors should remember that one quarter is just one quarter and not overreact to the third-quarter results. If you're not a short-term trader, Pinterest's prospects over the next few years and beyond is what's important. I continue to favor Pinterest in the broad social media category. The key reason is that the company's \"platform is product-centric -- in a way not unlike Amazon 's -- so it's a particularly good alignment with an advertising business model,\" I wrote in the fall of 2019, and still believe.",

    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is leading Turkey toward its biggest showdown with key Western allies since he assumed power two decades ago. At the heart of the row is a joint call on Turkey by ambassadors from 10 countries -- including the U.S. and Germany -- to free Osman Kavala, a 65-year-old businessman and philanthropist sent to jail four years ago, when Erdogan’s allies began accusing him of conspiring to overthrow the president. Kavala denies the accusations. Erdogan says the call for his release is an attack on Turkish sovereignty. The added strain on already tense ties with Western partners is likely to spur more volatility in the lira, which could push inflation even higher than its current level of around 20%.Continue Reading.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Pakistan had a statement victory over rivals India. (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Getty Images Away from the politicking and pettiness , in neutral terrain of Dubai, arch-rivals India and Pakistan provided a rare chance of diplomacy between the bickering neighboring countries in a T20 World Cup blockbuster on Sunday. They did it with smiles and sportsmanship, images of rival captains Virat Kohli and Babar Azam sharing a laugh should act as an unifying tool, something that political and cricket leaders from both countries would be wise to take heed of. Watched by hundreds of millions worldwide, who had waited more than two years for these teams to finally play each other, underdog Pakistan ended a World Cup jinx against India with a remarkable 10-wicket victory. In the first match between the countries since the 2019 World Cup - and the first at T20 level since 2016 - Pakistan flipped the script to lit a fuse under the T20 World Cup and ensure their long-suffering fans enjoy bragging rights. As they’ve grown in stature through an unparalleled reservoir of depth and resources, while Pakistan had to endure being cricket vagabonds for most of last decade, India have turned this rivalry into an anti-climax on the biggest stage.

They won the toss and soon enough a cacophony from the stands - a spine-tingling roar of pent up emotion - greeted Shaheen Afridi as he glided to the crease. And the left-arm ace produced two pearlers to dismiss dangerous openers KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma, rekindling images of lore during the heyday of the rivalry when the irrepressible Wasim Akram used his sublime skill to probe those great Indian batsmen. Shaheen Afridi starred for Pakistan. (Photo by Michael Steele-ICC/ICC via Getty Images) ICC via Getty Images Rahul and Rohit can win games single-handedly but they were no match for Shaheen’s menace in a reminder of why Pakistan has intoxicated cricket fans like no other over the years due to a rotating line of beguiling quicks. India, however, were favored to go all the way because of their sheer firepower honed in the breeding grounds of the Indian Premier League (IPL) - cricket’s richest tournament where Pakistani players are unfortunately banned from. Underlining this, the audacious Rishabh Pant cared not that his team were in an early hole by hitting two ridiculous one-handed sixes in the 12th over as India made their move. Pant only knows one way, even in the longer and more sedate formats, but he straddles a fine line which sometimes veers into recklessness. And, on cue, he holed out in the 13th over. Kohli, in the familiar role of riding his country’s hopes, played anchor with a top-score of 57 as he batted almost the whole innings but couldn’t quite get into his full flow despite moments of brilliance. India's captain Virat Kohli top scored for India. (Photo by AAMIR QURESHI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images After Kohli was dismissed in the 19th over, Pakistan being Pakistan let the initiative slip slightly in late chaotic scenes through trademark brainless fielding. India still finished with a middling score of 15o for 7 but the momentum had shifted and Pakistan were left rattled after such a disciplined bowling and fielding effort for the most part. Spoiler alert, this did not go to script. There was no Pakistan crumble in the chase as red-hot Babar and Mohammad Rizwan coolly dispatched India’s star-studded attack to make a statement in a powerful first-up victory. Pakistan came into the tournament largely written off with little match practice after controversial cancellations of tours from New Zealand and England while being engulfed in an exodus of leadership . Unless they meet in the business end of the tournament, these great rivals will not be pitted against one another probably until the next T20 World Cup - which is fortunately just 12 months away in Australia. The only salvation is that the lack of fixtures keeps this contest fresh magnifying the hype and spectacle. Every match, no matter where and when, is very much a blockbuster event - like a much-anticipated release of a Quentin Tarantino film with the legendary Hollywood director renowned for taking his sweet time on projects. Maybe less is more, a notable juxtaposition to the ‘big three’ powers of India, England and Australia who increasingly play each other on a continual loop making it hard to differentiate between series. Cricket fans watch the live telecast on a television at a shop in Karachi. (Photo by ASIF HASSAN/AFP ... [+] via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images It’s undoubtedly quite enthralling seeing Indian and Pakistani cricketers playing cat and mouse with each other, having to strategize on the fly against opponents they aren’t familiar with. Whereas the ‘big three’ countries know each other so well it’s like looking into a mirror. Still, despite that silver lining, it remains a travesty that these two great cricket nations don’t play one another in bilateral series across formats. It undermines the legitimacy of the new World Test Championship and Cricket World Cup Super League. It is cricket’s great shame but, sadly, it’s become accepted - even by the powers that be who just seemingly shrug their shoulders. There could, however, be a thawing in relations between India and Pakistan’s cricket boards with new Pakistan cricket boss Ramiz Raja indicating a pivot after his predecessor Ehsan Mani agitated BCCI chiefs, according to sources. The cavalier Mani, a former ICC boss, was not shy of admonishing cricket’s power trio even publicly when on election eve late last year he stated that the ICC chair should not be from the ‘big three’. According to sources, he was a key figure in the rival camp on the board mostly opposed to the ‘big three’ who have gained a stranglehold since the elevation of their preferred candidate Greg Barclay. Perhaps the high-profile Ramiz can usher in a new era starting at a pivotal ICC board meeting scheduled in the aftermath of the T20 World Cup - the first in-person meeting since the pandemic. However, given the bad blood at higher levels beyond cricket, the grim reality is that India and Pakistan won’t play each other regularly for a long time yet. But after this unexpected beat down, maybe Kohli’s men will be grateful for that.",

The report notes that China is also pushing companies like Visa and Nike to join in on the central bank digital currency (CBDC) rollout. Chinese Government Pushes McDonald’s, Visa, Nike to Accept CBDC The People’s Republic of China is preparing for its full roll-out of the CBDC in February 2022, during the introduction of the Beijing Winter Olympics. According to the Financial Times’ (FT) unnamed sources, the Chinese government wants McDonald’s to get on board with the digital yuan. FT notes that a large quantity of McDonald’s restaurants in Shanghai are currently testing China’s CBDC. Now Beijing is pressing the company itself to get more McDonald’s restaurants to follow Shanghai’s lead. A source stemming from McDonald’s told FT: “Shanghai is our pilot city and we will learn from customers’ response.” The information regarding the pressure from the Chinese government derives from sources that are “close to China’s financial regulators,” the report emphasized. China Is Gunning for a Winter Olympics Roll-Out — Digital Yuan Testing Continues to Increase Every day, China seems closer to launching the digital yuan as news of the testing has been leaked to the media on a regular basis. For instance, two prominent financial institutions, China Construction Bank (CCB) and Bank of Communications (Bocom), are testing the CBDC for investment funds and insurance services. For the first time, China’s CBDC was leveraged in the country’s futures market at the end of August. In mid-July, the country published the digital yuan’s white paper, which described smart contracts and tracing large transfers. On July 10, the digital yuan’s wallet was opened to 10 million Chinese citizens and the following day a report noted that over $40 million in ‘digital yuan red envelopes’ has been dispersed since the project started. The country seems like it could be ready to launch the CBDC by the 2022 Winter Olympics, but it’s only three months away. Meanwhile, as China’s CBDC is leaps and bounds further ahead than most countries, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said at the end of September that he doesn’t think the U.S. is behind the eight-ball in terms of a CBDC launch.

Dhirender Singh Bisht, senior research analyst (derivatives) at SMC Global Securities Ltd, said: \"From derivatives front, Call writers remained active at 18200-18300 & 18400 strikes, while Put writers hold maximum Open Interest at 18000 strike and seen not adding much Open Interest at lower levels. This shows that bulls are not feeling comfortable at current levels.\" Since May 2021, the NSE Nifty has been undergoing minor corrections up to three per cent. Considering VWAP of the September F&O series, the 18,050 level is also placed around the correction level. A move below 18,050 points may extend the current profit booking leg. Hence from a short-term perspective, longs should be avoided below this level. \"Indian markets remained mixed during the week as NSE Nifty slipped sharply from its record highs on the back of profit booking, while Banking index outperformed other sectors to end the week in green zone,\" added Bisht. For the week ended October 22, 2021, BSE Sensex closed at 60,821.62 points, a net loss of 484.33 points or 0.79 per cent, from the previous week's closing of 61,305.95 points. Registering a decline of 223.65 points or 1.21 per cent, NSE Nifty ended the week at 18,114.90 points from 18,338.55 points a week ago. Bisht forecasts: \"For upcoming week, we expect markets to remain on a volatile path on the back of October series expiry. On the lower side, now the 18000-17900 zone is likely to give support to Nifty while 18400 is a strong hurdle level.\" For the most of the series, the 18,000 Call strike held the highest Call base and any move above this given sharp up move towards 18,600points, based on which analysts predict that these levels should extend support on downsides. However, breach of these levels may push the index towards 17,600 in coming sessions, according to ICICI Direct.com. India VIX declined 2.72 per cent to 17.54 level. The volatility index India VIX is indicating caution in the market and after recent outperformance a leg of profit booking cannot be ruled out. \"Implied volatility (IV) of Calls closed at 16.75 per cent, while that for Put options closed at 17.31. The Nifty VIX for the week closed at 18.04 per cent. PCR of OI for the week closed at 0.79,\" remarked Bisht. Bank Nifty NSE's banking index closed the week at 40,323.65 points, a net recovery of 982.5 points or 2.49 per cent, from the previous week's closing of 39,340.90 points. The NSE banking index, which started witnessing fresh moves, is expected to continue its outperformance and may support markets in case of extended profit booking seen in technology and consumption stocks. The F&O data on ICICI Direct.com indicates that the banking index has surpassed its highest Call base placed at 40,000 strike and significant closure was observed in the last two sessions. Moreover, the low leverage in banking stocks may provide support on downsides. Hence, short-term positive bias should remain intact above 39,500 level, which has seen significant Put additions recently The Bank Nifty-Nifty price ratio has finally started moving on the back of outperformance of banking space, towards 2.22 level from 2.14 in a week. Derivatives analysts believe this trend may continue and the price ratio may move towards 2.26 in the short term.",

[+] HUBBS/NETFLIX) RICARDO HUBBS/NETFLIX © 2021 The Netflix NFLX limited series, Maid , was released on the streaming platform on October 1 and has remained in the Top 5 Shows most viewed ever since in many countries. According to Netflix, the series is on its way to reach 67 million households in its first four weeks, surpassing the record set by last year’s big hit, The Queen’s Gambit , which was watched by 62 million subscribers. If you’ve not seen Maid yet, its popularity being overshadowed in the headlines by Squid Game ’s overwhelming success (viewed by an amazing 142 million accounts), the 10-episode limited series takes viewers on the personal emotional journey of a young woman dealing with domestic abuse, the precarity of poverty and homelessness, and a troubled mother/daughter relationship. Maid is inspired by Stephanie Land’s Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother’s Will to Survive , a New York Times best-selling memoir. The series expands on the book, putting more emphasis on Alex’s relationship with her ex-Sean and her mother Paula. Alex, played by Margaret Qualley, is a young mother escaping an abusive relationship. As the series opens, Alex is leaving her boyfriend Sean (Nick Robinson) in the middle of the night, taking their daughter with her. Homeless and without a job, Alex battles to make ends meet for her and her young daughter Maddy, played by Rylea Nevaeh Whittet, to survive. Alex has no one really to turn to for help. Her mother Paula, played by Qualley’s own mother Andie MacDowell, is an eccentric artist who proves to be unreliable and incapable of looking out for Alex. Her absent father Hank (Billy Burke) is at first unwilling to help. Alex’s friends are all Sean’s. She is alone, fending for herself and her daughter. She seeks help from social services, but finds no real support. The social worker though does help her find a job at Value Maids, but the pay she gets from it barely covers her finances. From the synopsis, the series sounds like a dire ten hours to go through, so why has it become so popular? What showrunner and writer Molly Smith Metzler, and her team of writers, Marcus Gardley, Bekah Brunstetter, Colin McKenna and Michelle Denise Jackson, along with the directors John Wells, Nzingha Stewart, Lila Neugebauer, Helen Shaver and Quyen “Q” Tran, have managed to create is a tender and at times funny series that makes viewers feel invested in Alex’s journey. The camera never strays too far from Alex, showing her point of view of the situations she finds herself in. We, the viewers, go through her experiences with her, thanks to Qualley’s incredible performance. MORE FOR YOU ‘Dune’ Tops Foreign Box Office With Promising $77M Cume ‘Shang-Chi’ Box Office: Marvel Movie Tops $360M Worldwide 4 Series Coming To Netflix In October That Are Worth The Binge The series is at its most powerful in its raw depiction of the devastating impact domestic abuse has, showing the clear difference between couple arguments and emotional abuse. The series emphasizes the sense of complete isolation in which a young woman such as Alex would find herself. One of the most chilling moments (amongst many) in Maid is a scene where Sean is emotionally abusing Alex, forcing her to go sit at the table, while her father looks on, not saying a word. It is one of the most difficult episodes of the series, showing Alex sinking, removing herself from reality, only her unmoving shell remains, inert. Throughout the episodes, Alex has received no support. No one around her seems to understand her actions. In the opening sequence, when seeking refuge at her friend’s, one of Sean’s friends appears telling Alex “to stop being a bitch.” Perhaps none of them have seen the way Sean can be with Alex. But in that scene with Alex’s father Hank, there is a witness to the behavior. And he does nothing. There is a rawness to Maid that prevents it from falling into the melodramatic. It plunges us into Alex’s reality, her tender moments with her daughter, her difficult relationship with her mother, who needs help herself, and her darkest moments. It is a must-see.",

[+] Hitij/Getty Images) Getty Images It is a decision that is only a surprise at first glance. Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg has sacked head coach Mark van Bommel after just 13 games in charge. Van Bommel was hired in July to replace Oliver Glasner, who has led the club to a top-four finish last season but moved on after internal differences with director of sport Jörg Schmadtke. Schmadtke then surprised many by hiring van Bommel, who at his previous job at PSV Eindhoven averaged 1.95 points per game in 75 games but failed to win a major title. Van Bommel then inherited a squad that finished in the top four and invested $57.75 million in new players . The relationship then went off the worst possible way when Van Bommel made a substitution mistake in the first round of the DFB Pokal against the fourth division side Preußen Münster. Wolfsburg won that game but was eliminated by the DFB court for arbitration after Van Bommel made a sixth and illegal substitution in extra-time. In retrospect, that game might have been the first nail in the coffin for van Bommel. Schmadtke's displeasure at the time highlighted that he was not impressed by the decision-making of his coaching staff. But four wins to start the Bundesliga campaign quickly painted over cracks. Wins against Bochum, Hertha, Leipzig, and Fürth, however, masked the fact that van Bommel never seemed the perfect fit for the club. The first cracks appeared in the 0-0 draw against LOSC Lille, a game in which Wolfsburg was played off the pitch. From that draw onwards, Die Wölfe would not win another game under van Bommel.

Some might suggest that the 2-0 defeat to Freiburg on Saturday was the final nail in the coffin. But the heavy defeat to Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League was more likely the trigger. A substitute error against Preußen Münster may go down as the first nail in the coffin for Mark van ... [+] Bommel. (Photo by Christof Koepsel/Getty Images) Getty Images For Wolfsburg and the German Bundesliga, it was a historic defeat. For the first time in history, a German club had lost to an Austrian club in Europe's top club competition. Even worse, Wolfsburg was never in that game; Salzburg was dominant, playing brilliant football against a team whose market value is almost three times higher. The faces and reactions after the game were telling. \"We know we have to get ourselves out of it but to do that, we want to show our strength,\" Van Bommel said after the game against Salzburg. \"You can see that in training, and I’m completely confident you’ll be able to see it against Freiburg.\" Against Freiburg, it was much of the same, and the club saw no alternative but to sack van Bommel on Sunday afternoon. \"The bottom line is that there have been more separating than connecting factors,\" Schmadtke said in a statement on Sunday. \"The conviction that this constellation could maneuver us out of a difficult sporting situation is lacking and, therefore, we have made the decision to no longer work together.\" Van Bommel, in the meantime, was disappointed and surprised by the decision. \"I was convinced that together we could have returned to a path of success.\" The 44-year-old Dutchman is the first coach in the Bundesliga this season to be relieved of his position. Schmadtke has not yet communicated who will replace van Bommel. But the director of sport is considered one of the most talented managers in German football and would not have made this decision with a proper backup in mind. One coach currently available is Lucien Favre. Another option is current PSV head coach Roger Schmidt.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Sydney Wiseman, vice president of brand development and creative strategy at WowWee, with a licensed ... [+] Barbie version of the Pop2Play slide. WowWee The WowWee toy company’s roots are in robotics, and its first hit toy, Robosapien, was designed by a NASA scientist. For one of its newest toys, it decided to reinvent something low-tech - cardboard. The result was a toy line that could disrupt a significant industry category - plastic slides, playsets, and vehicles. It also turned out to be fortuitously timed to benefit from three factors - the desire of millennial parents to not have their living rooms constantly cluttered with large plastic playthings, a growing aversion by those same parents to plastic toys, and the need for playsets that take up less room in the cargo ships currently in short supply due to the global shipping crisis. WowWee used reinforced cardboard and a “Strongfold Technology” technique developed by an inventor to create a line of Pop2Play slides and playsets that are strong enough to withstand being climbed on by kids, but that fold flat and can be stashed under a couch when parents want to reclaim the living room. The first Pop2Play slide, released this spring, sold out on Amazon within 24 hours, and sold out three more times in the spring and summer. The Pop2Play slide is advertised at being able to hold children up to 50 lbs.. WowWee That success landed WowWee a licensing deal with Mattel for a foldable, cardboard version of a Barbie dreamhouse, which will launch in November, and a Barbie slide, to be released in the spring. MORE FOR YOU ‘No Christmas Trees, No Christmas Trees’ Another Shortage May Be On The Way The Grocery Business Is Going To Get Much More Competitive Costco Addresses Supply Chain Pains By Chartering Their Own Ships The Pop2Play slide isn’t just a new product for WowWee, it is another sign of how the company is positioning itself to become a bigger player in the industry by moving into new toy categories, both low- and high-tech, during a period of strong sales and healthy consumer demand for toys. “This is a very interesting time for the toy industry because a lot of the smaller companies are being very opportunistic and asking ‘Where can I go? Where’s the white space in the industry’,” said Chris Byrne, an independent toy consultant and co-host of The Playground podcast. Fingerlings and Baby Shark WowWee, founded by two Canadian brothers more than 30 years ago, is a privately-held company that doesn’t release its sales figures. That makes it hard to know exactly where it ranks in the toy hierarchy, but a series of hit products over the past five years have placed it among the toy companies in the tier below the three biggest players, Mattel, Hasbro, and Lego. WowWee hit a home run in 2017 with its Fingerlings toys, animatronic monkeys, unicorns and sloths that cling to a child’s finger and respond to sound and touch. It followed that with singing puppets featuring the wildly popular Baby Shark licensing property. The company says its sales grew 50% from 2020 to 2021. “We are expecting at least the same results going into 2022 as we expand into all sorts of new categories, including new and evergreen licenses and exciting original toy properties,” said Sydney Wiseman, vice president of brand development and creative strategy at WowWee. The Pop2Play slides and playsets fold flat for storage and can easily be returned to play mode. The ... [+] slides sold out on Amazon in 24 hours when they were first released this spring. WowWee Pop2Play is part of a lineup of bestsellers WowWee launched this year, one that includes the Got2Glow Fairy Finder, and the My Squishy Little dolls, two toys that employ the interactive tech WowWee is best known for. With the Pop2Play line, however, WowWee is hoping to develop a category that will be more resistant to the fads and fashions of hot toy trends, and will become a repeat seller for years to come. The cardboard alternative to plastic “Looking at how consistently the slide is selling, I think what our retailers are feeling that it is going to become a staple - like how a competitor with their plastic slide is there every single year,” Wiseman said. “We’re going to be the cardboard alternative to that.” Wiseman, who has been credited with engineering the success of the Fingerlings launch, also is a driving force behind Pop2Play. Her uncles, Richard and Peter Yanofsky founded the company, and she and her cousins have key roles in the family-run company. WowWee, which has offices in Hong Kong and Montreal, has, over the course of its history, been an independent company, been acquired by Hasbro, left Hasbro and become independent again, become part of a public company in a merger , and then went private again. When WowWee was approached about the Pop2Play concept, Wiseman said, the company realized “this can solve so many problems we were trying to crack, the biggest one being how do you eliminate or reimagine the big, bulky, plastic playset.” The toy was developed before the pandemic began, but its release this spring was hailed as a godsend by parents, particularly urban apartment dwellers, looking for indoor play options for kids. The slide, Wiseman said, turned out to be “the word-of-mouth toy of the century.” A New York City mom posted about it to her mom group on social media, and WowWee sold 250 slides within an hour. WowWee had lined up paid influencers to promote the toy, but had to tell them to hold off on their posts because the slide was already selling out. The Barbie Pop 2 Play playhouse WowWee The cardboard used to create the slides and playsets is strengthened with a proprietary laminate, but WowWee said it can be recycled in the same way as other cardboards. For parents, Wiseman said, being able to stash away a large toy out of sight when a child isn’t playing with it seems to be the biggest selling point, although the added sustainability is a benefit. “Bringing outdoor play indoors is our biggest unique feature, with the fold-away and put away, with the bonus that you’re being a little bit better for the environment,” Wiseman said. Zeitgeist of the millennial times James Zahn, senior editor of the Toy Insider and Deputy Editor of the Toy Book, said the Pop2Play slide fits into the zeitgeist of the millennial era. “We’ve seen a real movement over the past few years in which new generations of parents are looking for very specific features driven by a variety of factors, including space constraints, pricing, and sustainability,” Zahn said. “A traditional toddler slide takes up a big footprint,” he said. “Being able to collapse a slide and stash it under a couch, under a bed, or in a closet is fantastic.” While other companies in the action figure category have introduced large, foldable cardboard playsets previously, Pop2Play appears to be the first toy line “able to adapt that concept into something strong enough to be used by kids in a rugged way - like a slide,” Zahn said. All of the major toy companies have initiatives to eliminate plastics in their packaging, and to switch to recycled and recyclable plastics as much as possible in their toys. WowWee’s top goal in developing new toys, Wiseman said, is to be innovative, whether with tech or not. “Pop2Play still is incredibly innovative and feels different and fresh and fun, but in a way that doesn’t need batteries,” she said. WowWee Got 2 Glow fairy maker WowWee But the company isn’t breaking up with tech. Its Got2Glow Fairy Finder, which lets kids catch virtual electronic fairies, and play with them, in a tech-enabled “jar”, has made numerous retailer “hot toy” lists for this holiday season. WowWee announced this month that it had a licensing deal to produce collectible dolls tied to the Roblox game Twilight Daycare. And it is creating digital-first content for its My Squishy Littles dolls, with animated videos on the Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. YouTube channels. “WowWee seems to have taken a page from the major toymaker handbook with its recent focus on diversification, and that will allow the company to survive as trends come and go,” Zahn said.",

    "content": "Market likely to remain range-bound Market likely to remain range-bound New Delhi: The ongoing quarterly earnings will be the major factor driving market trends going ahead and benchmark indices may face volatility this week amid derivatives expiry, analysts said.Markets will also track global equities for further direction, they added.Yesha Shah, head (equity research) at Samco Securities, said: \"The market may struggle to hold its footing this week and is likely to stay range-bound. With the monthly expiry this week, market volatility may linger.\" Santosh Meena, head (research) at Swastika Investmart, said: \"If we talk about the cues for this week then the next batch of earnings season and the October month F&O (futures and options) expiry may cause volatility in the market.\" Meena added that the market will react to earnings of Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank on Monday. Siddhartha Khemka, head (retail research) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, adds: \"On Monday, investors will react to Reliance and ICICI Bank results along with global cues.\" \"In the week ahead, domestic markets will continue to track Q2 results for further direction. Any, further inconsistency, as seen in recent numbers, can lead to further fall in the short term,\" Vinod Nair, head (research) at Geojit Financial Services, said. \"Tech Mahindra, Ambuja Cement, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Adani Ports, L&T, Bajaj Auto, ITC, Maruti Suzuki, DLF, Indigo and Tata Power will come out with their earnings during the weak,\" Meena said. ICICI Bank on Saturday reported its highest-ever quarterly profit on a standalone basis at Rs 5,511 crore for the September 2021 quarter, on the back of healthy loan growth across verticals, aided by a fall in bad loans. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries on Friday reported a 43 per cent jump in its September quarter net profit, as its businesses from oil to retail fired on all cylinders, growing both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. Last week, the 30-share BSE benchmark declined 484.33 points or 0.79 per cent. Trading in the markets will also be influenced by movement in rupee, Brent crude oil and foreign institutional investors.",

    "content": "Approach markets in a high stock-specific wayApproach markets in a high stock-specific wayDomestic equity market benchmark indices snapped two-week winning spree and ended on a negative note. The NSE Nifty went down by 223.60 points or 1.22 percent during the last week and settled at 18,114.90 points. The NSE Nifty started the week on a positive note as it gapped higher on Monday. It made a new lifetime high on Tuesday at 18604. The Nifty Midcap-100 and Smallcap-100 indices were down by 4.4 percent and 5.4 percent. They declined seven percent and eight percent respectively from the high. The Bank Nifty gained by 2.5 percent and Fin nifty up by 1.9 percent. The Nifty FMCG index is the top loser with 6.1 percent. The remaining sector indices fell by 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent. The broader market breadth is extremely negative. Both the foreign and domestic institutions have become net sellers during the current month till now. The FIIs sold Rs9,869.93 crores and DIIs also sold Rs4,956.24 crores in the current month.The Nifty has met our target of 18600-650 on Tuesday. Bang on!!!. After meeting pattern target and Fibonacci extension levels, the benchmark index has reacted to the downside. It registered four consecutive negative sessions last week. The weekly chart has formed a dark cloud cover candle, which is bearish in nature. In any case, the Nifty closes below the 18,034 level, the bearish implication of dark cloud cover will get confirmation. In recent history, we have experienced that many of the bearish patterns failed to get the confirmations. We need to wait for confirmation to exit the market and change the stance to the downside. The market, as we are reiterating for the past few, is overbought and overextended. To come out of this condition, the profit booking is inevitable. Some of the indicators are already coming out of the overbought condition as the indices corrected in the last week. On a weekly chart, still, some indicators are in an overbought condition. The RSI has formed a double top and negative divergence on the weekly chart. In any case, the RSI closes below 73, the bearish implications of the negative divergence will get confirmation. The Stochastic oscillator is in the extreme overbought condition and forms a negative divergence. The ADX shows that the trend strength is deteriorating in the daily time frame. During the last week, the Nifty took the support at near 50 percent retracement level (18028). The 20 DMA support is at 17,952. This 17952-18028 zone of support is very critical for now. The VWAP Anchored at 1st October low is at 18041. And the 20 EMA is at 17957. So there are multiple supports around the 18000 zone. Unless the support is broken decisively, otherwise will not disrupt the ongoing trend. As the index is at multiple crucial support levels, we need to be cautious. In any case, the Nifty comes under further selling pressure and breaks the support levels, the market will witness a steeper correction. As stated above, a move above 18320 will bring some positive sentiment into the market. There is the probability that the Nifty may undergo the consolidation between 18000-18600 for some period before taking a decisive direction. The India VIX surged above 18 level during the week and settled at 17.55, up by 11.27 per cent. In the Options market, the Implied Volatility (IV) also advanced to near 15 levels. Sustaining above 18 levels will increase the swing lengths and it will become an extreme difficulty in shorter period trades. Even within 17940-18600 zone consolidation also experience volatility. Currently, the Nifty holds four distribution days in the last 45 days. Any addition of another three distribution days next week will change the market direction. One distribution day is expiring next week. The previous week's over two percent decline has resulted in momentum loss. Given the current technical setup, we can expect the pockets like PSE, Banks, PSU Banks, Auto, and select Financial Services stocks to put up a resilient show. We recommend avoiding excessive leveraged exposures and continue approaching the markets in a high stock-specific way while vigilantly protecting profits at higher levels.

    "description": "Investing in BTC is relatively more stable than other listless currencies that are being offered, from the risk perspective",
    "content": "Is it advisable to invest in bitcoin ETF?Is it advisable to invest in bitcoin ETF?Last week has seen some historic happenings in the financial markets. No, I'm not commenting about the newer equity highs by the world indices, but the launch of crypto based ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) approved by the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission), US. The ProShares bitcoin strategy ETF (BITO) debut is significant because it kind of marries the conventional financial markets (stocks, ETF, derivatives, etc.) and the crypto markets (digital-coins, -currencies, -assets, etc.). The approval of SEC to trade, albeit in the futures of bitcoin (BTC), provides for a tacit approval of the emerging avenue of these kinds. For the uninitiated, ETF (Exchange Traded Funds) are the securities that usually track an index, sector, bonds, commodity, or asset but which could be traded (purchase/sell) over a stock exchange like that of a stock. So, these could be representing a single commodity like that of a gold/silver/oil, etc. or a bunch of homogeneous stocks/securities like healthcare index, technology index, etc. and even a collection of heterogeneous stocks/securities like S&P 500 Index, NIFTY 50 Index, etc. or derivatives of any of these assets like that of Crude futures, Stock/Index futures, etc. These could be used as good diversification tool depending upon the underlying securities they chose to. Also due to the passive nature (just tracking a sector/index, etc.) these are cheaper option to the actively managed investment avenues like MF (mutual funds), PMS (Portfolio Management Services), etc. Over the weekend, SEC also has given green signal to Valkyrie ETF (BTF) on bitcoin Futures, a similar strategy that of BITO and there could be a flood of further such offerings in the coming months. While quizzed about the regulatory purview, the SEC chair, Gary Gensler has cleared the air over the approval of 'bitcoin futures ETF' and not 'bitcoin ETF' saying that they're \"technology neutral but not policy neutral\". He further explained that the offering is not directly invested or related to the bitcoin (project) but the underlying asset is bitcoin Futures. The current offering is different from those rejected earlier (earliest being in 2017) proposal for a bitcoin ETF which were to be tracking the spot price of the BTC. The reasons for the denial were that BTC was traded largely on unregulated exchanges, leaving it susceptible to fraud and manipulation. But things began to change as Coinbase (COIN) was listed on NASDAQ in April of this year. COIN is a centralized exchange for crypto assets/currencies and has come under the purview of the SEC through its listing. And the futures markets are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a sibling of SEC, as mentioned by the chair, the best we can is to bring projects into the investor protection perimeter i.e., the SEC. So, in a way a product which is overseen by the US regulator, CFTC, for four years has been wrapped inside which is in our jurisdiction, called the investment company. In simple terms, the ETF, regulated by the SEC, doesn't track the spot price of the BTC but the futures (derivative) of the BTC, regulated by the CFTC. These developments have helped the BTC and other crypto currencies to notch up higher values in trading, sensing that the regulators/govt. are warming up to mainstreaming these projects. The overall positivity around the offering ensured that the BITO has amassed over $1bn in assets under management (AUM), the second biggest on debut for an ETF. This ETF offering also addresses another issue for the investors or prospective investors on not just the trust factor but also the ownership infrastructure issues. Crypto currencies need wallets (store them) and required to be traded upon the designated crypto exchanges (COIN or Uniswap, etc.). This requires a fair amount of knowledge to overcome the complexity involved in executing these transactions as most of this infrastructure is private and out of the purview of any regulators or governments. What's for the Indian investor with this advancement. The Indian regulations have allowed foreign investments of up to $250,000 for annum through LRS (Liberalized Remittance Scheme) and now could take advantage of that facility to explore a proxy of the crypto markets and bitcoin, legally. Also, investing in BTC is relatively stable than the other listless currencies that are being offered, from the risk perspective. However, as the SEC chair cautions, it's still highly speculative asset class and underneath has a same aspect of volatility and speculation. Also there are other concerns which are technical and could have an adverse impact on how these ETFs operate. The bitcoin futures contracts are traded at the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) as BTC$ and the exchange has restrictions on the number of contracts an individual/entity could hold and is limited to 2000 in a month. The liquidity of BITO has already reportedly sucked in 1900 contracts of the current month and are also fast closing on the November limit. Either the regulators underestimated the demand or have a plan to amend the rules depending upon the situation. With more entrants possible in the coming months this could lead to higher demand and less liquidity that could eventually hold fresh subscriptions into these funds impacting the investors' prospects. This artificial demand could create differentiated price in the futures than the spot prices of BTC could lead to a condition called 'contagno', where the long-ended futures have higher prices compared to the shorter end contracts. We've witnessed recently last year in the US Oil ETF such a situation and confusing the investors further. Also, this could lead to losses as investors can't take advantage of the premium due to illiquidity. So, caveat emptor! (The author is a co-founder of 'Wealocity', a wealth management firm)  ",

Best Western Hotels Group The incoming president and chief executive officer for Best Western Hotels Group, Lawrence (Larry) M. Cuculic, shares how the pandemic affected his company and what’s next for its 18 hospitality brands. Cuculic was previously senior vice president and general counsel for the company. He begins his new role on Dec. 1. As he prepares for being at the helm of the international hotel group, he discusses how the company fared during the height of the pandemic and what it has its sights set on for 2022. What are Best Western’s goals as the industry recovers? The lobby of the Aiden By Best Western @ Cape Point in West Yarmouth, Massachusetts. Aiden is one of ... [+] Best Western's newest brands. Best Western The hospitality industry has endured its greatest crisis in history. Best Western is tremendously proud of how the organization and its hoteliers responded to the pandemic. The company is fortunate to be in the strongest financial position in its history allowing it to leverage this position of strength to increase revenue delivery to hotel owners. As the industry continues to recover, Best Western is planning to strengthen its loyalty program, work to increase brand revenue and drive development efforts across key markets in North America and across the globe. How will Best Western strengthen the loyalty program? An outdoor fire pit area at the Best Western Sevierville/Kodak Inn in Tennessee.

Through this program, consumers who do not have enough points for a free room can discount their room rate by using points. This is especially helpful since Best Western Rewards points never expire. GLo Best Western is one of the company's more youthful, design-focused brands. Best Western A recent McKinsey report showed that Best Western’s loyalty program, which spans 18 brands , delivers a higher revenue contribution than those for Wyndham, IHG or Choice, but that increasing enrollment is key. In regards to revenue contribution from the loyalty program, the report shows that Best Western Rewards has the third highest in its competitive set. During the pandemic, acquiring new loyalty program members became a challenge for hospitality reward programs. As travel rebounds and consumers are traveling, Best Western Rewards is hoping to expand its membership, which currently stands at 47 million members worldwide. New promotions are helping such as one for this fall that awards a $20 gift card for each night a member stays at a Best Western family hotel in the United States, Canada or the Caribbean (up to five nights) between now and Nov. 22. What plans do you have for Best Western Plus? A Best Western Plus hotel's exterior Best Western Best Western Plus has always been a preferred brand among both business and leisure travelers. According to that same McKinsey survey, Best Western Plus was underperforming in its competitive set on average rate and revenue per available room (RevPAR). There is potential for the brand to increase the average daily rate, occupancy, and RevPAR. Best Western is focused on attracting more weekday business to make that happen. As a membership organization, the company has asked hoteliers to consider incorporating enhancements including a variety of potential new amenities, such as specialty coffee machines in the lobby and breakfast areas, in-room Keurig coffee makers, larger televisions in guest rooms with streaming/casting capabilities and enhanced fitness equipment. How did Covid-19 affect Best Western’s balance sheet? A treadmill at the Best Western River North Hotel in Chicago sports an individual hand-sanitizing ... [+] station.

Best Western was able to provide over $65 million in financial relief to hotel owners over the past 18 months, and the brand is seeing both an increased average daily rate and occupancy due to the pent-up demand. In addition to the austerity plan, Best Western was among the first to roll out enhanced cleaning protocols and operational best practices during the pandemic.

Consumers are relying more and more on the mobile experience, and the brand is working to make digital experiences more user-friendly. Best Western is also developing the ability to accept additional forms of payment. This includes making gift cards easier to use by enabling them to be redeemed online and the ability to use points to reduce the room rate (Pay With Points).

    "full_description": "In 2022, the average Social Security benefit will be a bit higher than in 2021. But, would you be able to live on your retirement benefits if you collected anywhere close to what the typical senior receives? The answer may surprise you. Image source: Getty Images. Living on the average Social Security benefit could be a challenge In 2022, the average Social Security benefit is going up to $1,657. This is a $92 increase from the $1,565 average benefit retirees received in 2021. The big benefit increase is a result of the fact that inflation is high, and seniors get periodic cost of living adjustments when prices are going up. Next year, retirees will be getting a 5.9% raise because consumer expenditure costs are rising so much. If you do a little quick math, you'll see that retirees who are on track to get the average amount of Social Security income would be left with an annual income of $19,884 in 2022. Sadly, you'll likely find that this is not nearly enough money to live comfortably on during your later years -- especially with the federal poverty level at $12,880 for a single-person household. An income just a few thousand dollars above the federal poverty level can leave seniors facing the worst of both worlds. They'll make too much to be eligible for many of the state and federal benefits programs that could help them make ends meet but too little to afford all the essentials. While it may come as a surprise that Social Security benefits aren't enough to live on, the reality is that the program wasn't meant to be your sole source of support and was supposed to be supplemented by savings and a pension. If you have neither, you'll almost inevitably find yourself struggling. What to do if you can't live on the average Social Security benefit Since living on the average Social Security benefit is difficult or impossible -- even in 2022 after retirees receive the largest cost of living increase in 40 years -- it's important to plan for additional income. If you haven't yet retired, make sure to set a savings goal so your nest egg produces enough money to supplement your retirement benefits. Start saving as soon as possible and aim to automate contributions to a retirement account so you end up with the money you need. If you're already in retirement, working part time could help you bring in additional much-needed funds if you don't have a lot of savings. You may also want to relocate to an inexpensive community if you are trying to live on Social Security alone. Delaying a benefits claim can also increase the amount of Social Security income you receive if you haven't yet filed for your checks to start. By waiting, you avoid early filing penalties that would reduce your check if you applied for it before full retirement age, and you can earn delayed retirement credits until age 70 that increase your benefit amount. These steps still aren't going to give you a Social Security check that you can easily live on, but they can help you make the most of your benefits if you'll rely heavily on them to support you after leaving the workforce.",

Before Goff could face the Rams on Sunday, L.A. moved some numbers as it tiptoes around the fringes of the salary cap with a roster built for a deep playoff run. The Rams, who took a $24.7 million dead cap hit when trading Goff for Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford, restructured right tackle Rob Havenstein’s contract, according to the NFL Network. It’s estimated that L.A. was under the cap by about $152,000 before revisiting Havenstein’s four-year, $32.5 million deal. The maneuver will free up some $3 million in cap space. The Rams (5-1) could also be clearing room to complement their squad before the trading deadline on Nov. 2. Yet coach Sean McVay said he doesn’t anticipate “any big splash moves.” Considering L.A.’s financial restraints by absorbing more than $33 million in dead money from just Goff and ex-running back Todd Gurley, that’s a fair prediction. Considering general manager Les Snead’s track record in which he’s acquired safety Jalen Ramsey and dumped cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Marcus Peters at the deadline, it’s also fair to be aware. “I would never say never,’’ McVay said, “as you know.” The Rams have needs at linebacker, running back, tight end and in the secondary. Yet staying under the cap is job No. 1, and with Havenstein being agreeable to pushing money out, the Rams pulled back from its brink.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 03: Jimmy Garoppolo #10 of the San Francisco 49ers looks to throw ... [+] a pass during the second quarter against the Seattle Seahawks at Levi's Stadium on October 03, 2021 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images) Getty Images Jimmy Garoppolo will be back as the San Francisco 49ers' starting quarterback on Sunday when they face the Indianapolis Colts in primetime in a matchup that could mark his last chance to prove he should remain in that position ahead of Trey Lance this year. Garoppolo will know that, for all intents and purposes, this is his final season with the Niners. San Francisco traded three first-round picks to acquire Lance and will want to see a return on that investment in the not-too-distant future. But head coach Kyle Shanahan has made little secret of the fact he does not believe the third overall pick is ready to take the reins yet and, with Lance out injured after suffering a knee sprain in his start in relief of Garoppolo against the Arizona Cardinals, the former New England Patriot will be tasked with getting the 49ers back on track after three successive losses. Garoppolo's mission for 2021 was clear: shrug off an injury curtailed 2020 and restore the Niners as a playoff contender while giving Lance chance to develop. The added benefit of that scenario would be Garoppolo increasing his trade value and helping the Niners recoup some assets given the significant amount they parted with to land their quarterback of the future. However, to this point, Garoppolo has not adhered to that brief. Garoppolo ranks an impressive fifth in Expected Points Added per play among quarterbacks, according to Ben Baldwin of The Athletic. However, those numbers are partially a reflection of the quarterback-friendly nature of Kyle Shanahan's offense along with Garoppolo's experience in running it.

His completion percentage over expected is minus 1.4, per the NFL's NextGen Stats , with Garoppolo completing on 66.1 percent of his passes when expected to connect on 67.5. Garoppolo is not enjoying a strong season in terms of accuracy, and he is continuing to serve as a very conservative quarterback who struggles to push the ball downfield consistently. His intended air yards per attempt average of 6.7 is the third lowest in the NFL, per NextGen Stats. For Shanahan and the Niners to make a convincing case for Garoppolo remaining as the starter, there must be an imminent upturn in his performances and their results. The Colts, who rank 29th in Football Outsiders pass defense DVOA, perhaps provide the ideal opponent for him to get back on track, though a forecast of heavy rain may limit his opportunities to take advantage of Indianapolis' weakness in that area. Should he again fail to impress and the Niners suffer another dent to their playoff aspirations by falling to 2-4, it will be tougher to make the argument for Garoppolo staying ahead of Lance on the depth chart and taking reps away from the rookie that would benefit his development. The further the 49ers fall behind in the playoff picture, the more the 2021 season needs to become about preparing Lance for a full season as a starter in 2022. In that sense, a favorable matchup at home against a 2-4 Colts team should represent the last-chance saloon for Garoppolo. It is one he looks set to face without his starting left tackle, as Trent Williams is doubtful with an ankle injury, but that is unlikely to be accepted as an excuse should the Niners fall short against a Colts team they are favored to beat. Garoppolo is at the stage of his 49ers career where he is out of excuses. He has performed efficiently but not at a particularly high level and has already missed a game due to injury. The 2021 season has to this point served as a frustratingly familiar tale for San Francisco's starter and Garoppolo's time in that role could soon come to an end if he fails to write a positive chapter in Week 7.",

In this video clip from \"Beat & Raise,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Neil Patel and Demitri Kalogeropoulos discuss how this piece of the business is contributing to the retailer's phenomenal growth. Neil Patel: It's like you said, Demitri and Brian, I think both of you alluded to this, that it seems impressive they're still growing. I don't know what revenue growth that you mentioned, sorry, but they're still growing after last year's surge. I think for a company this size, I think investors who are on the sideline think that, OK, very happy, 100 plus warehouses, how much more can they grow? Last year was basically free marketing for Costco. People who weren't already members, now you have a reason to be a member of Costco. I think they're going to attack members who see the value proposition of being a customer there, and so the fact that they're still growing compared to 2020 is pretty remarkable. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: On that point too, one other cool thing about Costco is, they're obviously a consumer staples they're in that category of obviously pantry staples, and that's why they were an essential retailer through the pandemic and they stayed open and people just flock to their stores. But they also have a huge consumer discretionary business, I mentioned there was travel, you can buy vacations and stuff: cruise ship, cruise lines, whatever you want. I was reading the conference call today and they mentioned they sold over $100,000 rings, which is interesting when a single-product sale is big enough that the CFO would mention in their earnings call. [laughs] But Costco does that. They've also got that really high-end. If you want to be very discretionary with your spending, you can do that at Costco too.",

Start-up electric vehicle automaker Xpeng has latched onto this date for its annual Tech Days, and this year, for the third Xpeng Tech Day, the company is announcing a slew of updates, including improved smart driver assist technology, better supercharging technology that will shorten charging times for the brand's EVs in China and a surprising flying car. Xpeng flying car in road form. Xpeng Xpeng's plans to take to the sky are due to HT Aero, the automaker's affiliated Urban Air Mobility (UAM) company. HT Aero has already tested its flying drone/car prototypes on over 15,000 flights, XPeng said, but the next-generation flying car design unveiled today shows just how ambitious the company is. Supposed to roll out in 2024, this new road-capable EV features a rotor mechanism that folds into the car, so you can either speed down the road or helicopter your way out of traffic. Whether or not this ever becomes a reality, James Bond would certainly approve. Xpeng Lidar Rendering Xpeng Back down on earth, Xpeng's limited self-driving technology - it does not offer full autonomous driving - is called XPilot, and the 3.0 version of this software has been around since early 2021. It offers Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) on highways and limited Valet Parking Assist (VPA) memory parking functions. XPeng said today that Xpilot 3.0 has already been used to drive almost 7.5 million miles on China's highways, and accounted for 60 percent of the highway driving mileage that XPeng's drivers put on their cars in the third quarter of 2021.

For this update, XPeng is introducing a new sensor suite that uses \"the industry's first mass-produced quadruple perception fusion solution, with dual-camera-vision coverage, complemented by ultrasonic, millimeter-wave radar and LiDAR sensors.\" All of that will allow the car's visual perception network to get upgraded from 2D detection to 3D, the company said. Xpilot 3.5 also represents the world's first LiDAR perception system in a mass production model. Coming in the first half of 2023, then, will be Xpilot 4.0, which Xpeng claims will \"be first to deliver full-scenario assisted smart driving experiences from vehicle switch-on to parking.\" That's an ambitious promise, but Xpeng says the system will require a \"comprehensive hardware upgrade,\" that will significantly increase the system's perception capability.

    "full_description": "Covering your costs in your retirement will probably be the largest financial goal in your life. Your retirement can potentially last for decades, and once you no longer collect a paycheck, your savings and investments will probably have to cover a huge chunk of your expenses. With that in mind, it's incredible important to start saving for retirement early, making use of tools that are designed to help you get there effectively and efficiently. These three approaches are among the absolute best ways to invest for your retirement. Image source: Getty Images No. 1: Roth 401(k) A Roth 401(k) can be the most powerful tool you can use to invest for your retirement, if your employer offers it and if you still have over a decade or so until you retire. Roth 401(k)s allow you to invest after-tax dollars in the plan and then withdraw the money completely tax-free once you reach age 59 1/2 as long as you've had money in the account for at least five years. In addition, your contributions come directly out of your paycheck, which makes it much less tempting to spend the money. When you're early in your career, your income (and thus tax rate) will probably be lower than later in your career. As a result, you won't benefit as much from the immediate tax deduction that a Traditional-style 401(k) offers. Early in your career, your money will also have longer to compound on your behalf, making the tax-free withdrawals in retirement that much more valuable for you. That's particularly true when compared to Traditional style 401(k) plans where your withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. In 2021, if you're under 50, you can generally contribute up to $19,500 to your Roth 401(k) plan. If you're 50 or more, you can make an additional $6,500 in catch-up contributions, making the typical limit $26,000. No. 2: Roth IRA The Roth IRA brings with it a ton of flexibility and key features that makes it a very high-powered retirement account. In particular, the withdrawal rules can be very friendly and flexible for both early retirees and those retiring at a more standard age. That makes the Roth IRA a key tool for people with earned income looking to manage their retirement money effectively and efficiently. What keeps it from the top spot is that contribution limits are lower than a Roth 401(k) and have tighter restrictions on who can contribute. In 2021, contribution limits are generally $6,000 for those under 50 or $7,000 for those 50 and up. In addition, if your income is too high, your contribution limits start to phase out. The limits start coming into play above $125,000 if you're single, above $198,000 if you're married filing jointly, or if you have any income at all if you're married filing separately. Still, as a testament to the flexibility of a Roth IRA, you can typically roll money into your Roth IRA from other qualifying retirement accounts to build up your balance that way. Building up a big Roth IRA balance is beneficial because the withdrawal strategies are so flexible. First, you can withdraw money you directly contribute to your Roth IRA at any time for any reason and pay no taxes or penalties on that withdrawal at all. Next, you can withdraw money you rolled over into a Roth IRA after it has sat in the Roth IRA for at least five years and pay no taxes or penalties. In addition, once you've reached age 59 and a half, you can withdraw money from your Roth IRA completely tax and penalty free for the rest of your life, as long as the account has had money for at least five years. Perhaps the most powerful benefit of all, though, is that you never have to take a withdrawal from your own Roth IRA during your lifetime. Only inherited Roth IRAs are subject to Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), which means money in your own Roth IRA can continue to compound completely tax free for the rest of your life. For retirees who have significant balances in Traditional retirement plans, those RMDs can add substantial costs and taxes that can be sidestepped with a Roth IRA. No. 3: Traditional 401(k) When you're later in your career and if you don't already have a large balance in Traditional-style retirement accounts, a Traditional 401(k) can be a very savvy investment vehicle to use. Like a Roth 401(k), your contributions come directly out of your paycheck, but they are made pre-tax. If you're in a high tax bracket, that immediate deduction can come in incredibly handy. Contribution limits are the same as for a Roth 401(k). The key downsides of a Traditional 401(k) are that your withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement and that your balance is subject to those RMDs once you reach age 72. If your balance isn't too large, the RMDs can be manageable. Indeed, when paired with the immediate tax deduction for your contribution and the fact that most people's income's drop once they retire, a Traditional 401(k) can offer the best of both worlds. After all, if your income is essentially $0 other than your 401(k) withdrawals, those withdrawals first cover your standard deduction and then low tax brackets before the taxes really start to bite. As a result, you can get a big tax deduction for putting money in while you're making high income and then take money out when your taxes are lower because your income is lower, too. Just be wary of letting your Traditional 401(k) balance get too large. Once you reach age 72, you are required to take distributions from that account based on your age and account balance. Those distributions are treated as ordinary income. As a result, they can raise your Medicare Part B costs, the portion of your Social Security income that is subject to taxes, and your ordinary income tax bill as well. If your projections of your balance starts to get high enough that you're worried those costs will start to bite hard, consider rolling a portion of your balance to your Roth IRA. You'll pay taxes on the conversion, but once the money is in your Roth IRA, you could potentially never pay taxes on it again. Do note that once your Traditional 401(k) is subject to mandatory withdrawals, you must take those withdrawals out of your retirement accounts, but you can roll any additional amount into your Roth IRA. Get started now Regardless of how you choose to invest and plan for your retirement , the most important thing you can do is get started now. The sooner you begin your journey, the longer you can let compounding work on your behalf. That can both reduce the amount of money you need to sock away each month and ultimately add up to a much more financially comfortable future. You will never again have more time before you retire than you do right now. So make today the day you start making use of at least one of these three tools to build a better retirement for yourself.",

The most recent examples are the explosive upward moves by shares of Donald Trump's social media-associated stocks, Digital World Acquisition ( NASDAQ:DWAC ) and Phunware ( NASDAQ:PHUN ) . Last week, Digital World Acquisition's shares rose by as much as 1,500%. Phunware's shares, for their part, posted a jaw-dropping intraday high of over 2,000% during a single trading session last week. This week, it might be biotech 's turn at the parabolic-move game. Shares of Aurinia Pharmaceuticals ( NASDAQ:AUPH ) and Ocugen ( NASDAQ:OCGN ) could both move sharply higher this coming week. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Aurinia Pharmaceuticals: A buyout special Mergers and acquisitions have been the name of the game for biotech investors this year. While the industry as a whole has trended lower in 2021 for a variety of reasons, shareholders of Acceleron Pharma , Trillium Therapeutics , and Kadmon Holdings , among several others, have all done fairly well this year because the companies were all bought out at a hefty premium. Aurinia Pharmaceuticals may be the next big pharma acquisition. A deal, in fact, could happen as soon as this coming Monday. Last Friday, Bloomberg News reported that Bristol Myers Squibb ( NYSE:BMY ) was in talks with Aurinia about a potential buyout. Although the report made it clear that a deal wasn't a sure thing, biotech is notorious for its pre-merger news leaks. Such leaks occur for a host of reasons. But the typical reason is to increase a company's leverage in the buyout negotiations. In effect, Bristol might be trying to lowball Aurinia. Aurinia's brain trust, in turn, might have leaked the news in an attempt to force the pharma giant to up its offer. Why would a company like Bristol be interested in Aurinia? Well, Aurinia sports an oral lupus nephritis (LN) medication called Lupkynis that could eventually haul in multibillion-dollar annual sales. Now, the drug probably won't be a huge seller with a small company like Aurinia heading up its commercialization. But Bristol, with its vast salesforce and commercial infrastructure, could probably get the most out of this novel LN drug from a sales standpoint. Keeping with this theme, Wall Street has pegged Lupkynis' peak sales at close to $2 billion a year. Aurinia, in a buyout scenario, should be fairly valued at somewhere between 3 to 5 times this peak sales forecast. On Friday's close, Aurinia's market cap stood at approximately $3.6 billion. So a buyout could come at a premium -- relative to Friday's close -- of between 66% and perhaps a whopping 177%. Either of those premiums would arguably constitute a parabolic move by Aurinia's stock. Ocugen: Waiting on WHO Ocugen, a small-cap biotech, has already seen its shares go parabolic over the past year. Thanks to a North American co-commercialization deal with India's Bharat Biotech for the COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin, this tiny biotech has become one of the best-performing stocks in the entire market this year. Ocugen's shares, however, have lost almost half of their value in the past few months because of a multitude of regulatory delays and setbacks for Covaxin. For example, the vaccine will now reportedly go through the full vetting process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), instead of the coveted emergency-use authorization route. That news hasn't sat well with Ocugen's shareholders of late. But the next major catalyst for the company could be close at hand. What's the catalyst? The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently evaluating the vaccine's emergency use listing (EUL) application. This key regulatory decision is supposed to come down before the end of October, and perhaps as soon at next Tuesday during the WHO's next technical advisory group meeting. WHO officials, however, said last week that they cannot \"cut corners\" and that these decisions can take longer than expected. So a delay of a few days or weeks certainly isn't out of the question. Now, a WHO EUL green light wouldn't directly affect Ocugen from a top-line standpoint. The vaccine still needs approval from the FDA and Canada's regulatory body before the company can start booking sales in these territories. But this key regulatory designation would go a long way toward validating Covaxin as a globally important COVID-19 vaccine. A positive WHO EUL decision for Covaxin, therefore, could light a fire underneath Ocugen's shares next week.",

Unfortunately, earning too much money could sometimes affect your continued eligibility for Social Security retirement benefits. The good news, though, is that fewer older Americans will have to worry about that next year because of this important change. Image source: Getty Images. A higher paycheck won't affect Social Security benefits as much in 2022 For seniors interested in working while receiving retirement benefits, it's crucial to know the rules that apply because running afoul of them could accidentally result in a loss of Social Security checks. See, if you are over full retirement age (FRA) , you are allowed to work and earn as much as you'd like without any consequences for your Social Security checks . But seniors won't reach that milestone until they're at least 66 years and 2 months old. Depending on birth year, some retirees won't hit FRA until 70. Since retirement benefits can be claimed starting at age 62 , many seniors have years they could potentially receive paychecks from a job before hitting FRA. During these intervening years when you're getting benefits but haven't reached your full retirement age, working can have consequences with regards to Social Security checks. But that only happens once your income hits a certain threshold -- and the income you can bring in before benefits are affected is going up in 2022. Here's the 2022 change to Social Security's work rules Next year, retirees who will not reach full retirement age for the entire year are allowed to earn up to $19,560 per year or $1,630 per month without having their Social Security checks affected. This is up from $18,960 annually or $1,580 monthly in 2021. For seniors who will reach FRA at some point during the year but who are working before that time, they can earn $51,960 per year or $4,330 per month in 2022 before losing benefits, up from $50,520 or $4,210 per month in 2021. Working seniors who won't hit FRA at any point during the year will lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in income above the income limit, while those who will reach FRA but are working before it end up forfeiting $1 in benefits for every $3 in excess income. The loss of Social Security funds can be a big hit to retirees, many of whom may have been counting on getting both a paycheck and retirement benefits to help them make ends meet. That's why it's such good news that the earnings threshold before benefits are affected is going up. Of course, those who do forfeit benefits won't lose them forever. Retirees who miss checks because they earn too much will have their Social Security benefit amount recalculated when they do reach full retirement age. Their checks will grow because of the foregone benefits, although the increase is small and it can take years to earn back all the missed money. The good news is, with next year's higher earnings threshold, fewer seniors will be subject to this benefit reduction and more retirees who work part-time or full time will still get to keep the full amount of their Social Security while also bringing home a paycheck.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Kai-Fu Lee, chairman and chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures. Photographer: Joe ... [+] Buglewicz/Bloomberg © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP AI is changing the way we live and the global balance of military power. Ex-Pentagon software chief Nicholas Chaillan said this month the U.S. has already lost out to China in military applications. Even 98-year-old Henry Kissinger weighs in on AI as co-author of a new book due next month, “The Age of AI: And Our Human Future.” Kai-Fu Lee has been sizing up the implications for decades. The former Google executive turned venture capitalist looked at U.S.-China competition in his 2018 book, “AI Superpowers.” His new book, “AI 2041,” co-authored with science fiction writer Chen Qiufan, suggests how AI will bring sweeping changes to daily life in the next 20 years. I talked earlier this month to Lee, who currently oversees $2.7 billion of assets at Beijing-headquartered Sinovation Ventures. Sinovation has backed seven AI start-ups that have become “unicorns” worth more than $1 billion: AInnovation, 4Paradigm, Megvii, Momenta, WeRide, Horizon Robotics and Bitman. We discussed Lee’s new book, the investments he’s made based on his predictions in it, and where the U.S.-China AI rivalry now stands. Excerpts follow. Flannery: Before we talk about the new book, let's first look back on “AI Superpowers.” How has U.S.-China competition unfolded since it was published three years ago? Lee: Both countries have continued to become the “AI Superpowers” that I predicted, leading the world by far. The U.S. is stronger in fundamental research, enterprise software and enterprise AI. China has accelerated its robotics and manufacturing. It's a good match, right? The U.S. is stronger in enterprise software, and China is stronger in manufacturing. Naturally, each will apply AI to areas that it's strong in. Both countries have done a lot in AI for healthcare. That's kind of emergent and is beyond my predictions in “AI Superpowers” because Covid really accelerated a lot of that. And that has led to AI-based drug discovery, protein folding, intelligent AI-based radiology, AI for social distancing, and the use of robotics in laboratories. It turns out that the laboratory is a great place for robotics. An example of one of the portfolio companies we’ve invested in is a company called MegaRobo. It has developed a robotic machine that can do Covid tests 100 times faster than without the machine because it's 24-7 with everything in parallel. That same product could be extended to laboratory research, and, essentially, start to replace much of the work that laboratory technicians do. We're seeing lots of great breakthroughs in healthcare.

It’s almost caught up on top-10% papers; it's still behind in top-1% papers. One way to describe that is Chinese young researchers are very comparable to, if not more numerous than, American AI researchers. China still lags with more senior, brilliant researchers, but the young researchers in another 10 or 20 years will hopefully fill that hole. So overall, I think both countries have done well. If you go forward one or one and a half years and count the number of AI IPO companies, China will actually be ahead. We can count about 10 to 12 expected AI companies to be listed publicly at multi-billion-dollar valuations in China by the end of next year. I don't think the U.S. number will be that large. Flannery: The format for “AI 2041” differs from “AI Superpowers,” using fictional stories with follow-up analysis of their lessons. How has the response been? Lee: Mostly very positive. I wanted to use imaginative stories to introduce AI to people who might otherwise find AI intimidating. Twenty years into the future is a good period of time — anything too short wouldn’t seem revolutionary; anything too long wouldn’t be a responsible prediction. The stories take place in 10 different countries and affect 10 different industries. Flannery: If you had to pick one of the 10 as the most important, which would it be and why? Lee: “Contactless Love” would be the most important because it illustrates the power of AI for healthcare. The pandemic has woken all of us up about how fragile we human beings are. AI is ready to be adopted to help address future pandemics, future health and future healthcare. Human healthcare is being digitized in the areas of wearable computing, radiology, genetic sequencing and more detailed blood tests. Data can be fed into AI engines, whether it's for diagnosis, treatment, preventive maintenance, or health exams. An AI healthcare assistant can be invaluable in showing us where our Kai-Fu Lee is the co-author of \"AI 2041.\" Currency, Penguin Random House vulnerabilities are, how to reduce the vulnerabilities, what kind of medicine to take, and how to exercise in a way that fits us personally. When there’s a lot of data, AI is very suitable for high-precision recommendations and decisions. A lot of other AI technologies are hugely impactful, but they can be used for good or bad. One technology area that I think is really ‘AI for good’ is healthcare. Flannery: Let's connect the book with your investments at Sinovation. First, how important is AI in your investment mix? Lee: It's quite important — probably related to 70% of our investments. They're not all pure AI companies. AI’s development is such that some proven technologies are still in the process of being infused into products and industries. True breakthroughs are 10 or 15% of our investments. The other ones are what I think of as AI applications. Altogether, it’s about 70%. Flannery: Can you take us through some of the investments that you've made and how they fit into the visions you present in the book? Lee: The “Deep Fake” chapter talks about computer perception and vision. This was all largely traced back to deep learning and convolutional neural networks, which became popular around five to seven years ago. We at Sinovation saw that computer vision was going to be disruptive, and that machines would be able to see as well as people — not exactly the same as, but as well as. For example, in recognizing objects and faces, it can do better than people. We saw that this could be used for autonomous retail stores, radiology and visual inspection of quality in manufacturing. It also can be used with navigating robots and autonomous vehicles. Deep learning can be applied to computer vision, which will have many industrial applications. All told, we have about 14 companies in that category of computer vision applications. Several of them will go public before the end of next year. Another breakthrough we are seeing right now is in large, self-supervised natural language models that can be fine-tuned. I think natural language will be the next big AI application. Vision came first; natural language comes next. You can see in “Twin Sparrow” in the book how AI companions for kids have been trained, can converse fluently in human language, and can have a very coherent dialogue with kids, helping them along. We have made four investments to date in natural language, and will probably make another dozen investments to create a similar portfolio to computer vision. Flannery: What’s ahead in the entertainment industry? Lee: We are not investing in that area because I think it is a bit farther out. AR-VR is still too clumsy. The head-mounted displays are too big. People get dizzy. Content is too expensive to create. I do think those problems will be fixed over time, and the experience will be truly vivid, realistic and doesn’t make people dizzy, and it will be relatively inexpensive to create content. It will be a five- to 10-year time horizon when this happens Flannery: How will autonomous driving unfold? Lee: We see transportation as a huge revolutionary area for AI autonomous vehicles. However, if you think of it as fully replacing a human driver and removing the steering wheel, the accelerator and the brake from a car, we're still at least 10, if not 15, years away from that. It’s very hard to make a successful investment for that because you have to keep burning money and gathering data, and will have no revenue for a long, long time. A much more appropriate way is to find low-hanging fruit. A more constrained environment with a simpler problem in which you gather data and incrementally make your AI better can work. We have invested in four companies doing exactly that. One is doing airport-based transportation, and another doing is transportation at ports — moving crates. A third one is doing aftermarket products that will help drivers and gathers data. The last company is making robo mini buses – they are deploying in three cities this year. These robo mini buses are much easier to deploy than robot cars and robot taxis, because robo buses have fixed routes. Once you gather data for these Kai-Fu Lee as he appeared on the cover of Forbes China in 2018. Forbes China robo buses, then you can tackle robo taxis. For each, we don’t have to wait 10-15 years for revenue. Flannery: Toward the end of the book, you suggest that developments in AI will challenge conventional economic theory. Could you talk a little bit about that? Lee: If we look beyond 2041 at a longer 20- to 40-year time horizon, I think the cost of goods will come down dramatically. The cost of labor will become lower because of automation. The cost of materials will be also significantly reduced by advancements in life science and material science. The cost of energy will also come down with distributed solar plus battery storage. We've already seen big improvements in the last 10 years. Not just the cost of everyday goods like our cell phones or cars should come down. Currently non-manufactured things will become manufacturable. For example, food, vegetables and meat will start to be produced in the factory, not necessarily so much on the farm. We will reduce many of today's problems to manufacturing problems. At that stage, the cost of providing everyone with a home, food, basic transportation and clothing should be doable. That is, we should be able to wipe out poverty and hunger. And alongside of that, our existing economic systems are not going to work anymore. That includes the market economy or capitalism, the stock market, money and jobs. In the book, I call it “the age of plentitude.” In the future, routine jobs will all be taken by AI so the meaning of a job may change. The meaning of money may change, because the state may want to subsidize everyone with universal basic income. We also may want to motivate people not just by money; money may not be the single measure of compensation. I think the positive part will be our ability to make a lot of things at a much lower price. AI will do all the routine jobs for us, but what about jobs being displaced? What about the companies that need a profit to justify their stock prices? These are things have to solved. For every benefit, there's also a set of problems to be to be solved.

It is currently one of the fastest-growing smartphone brands in the world and sold more than one million units just in April 2021 in its home market of China, and has a plethora of models lined up for the future. It has become the fastest smartphone company ever to export 100 million smartphones internally and the feat was achieved in a span of just 37 months. A couple of months ago, Realme sold its 100 millionth smartphone as well and alongside China, the brand has India as its key market. It is no secret that electronic heavyweights would venture into (or explore the possibilities of) other disciplines. Companies like Sony and Apple are some of the prime examples. It looks like Realme might have something to say about it as the ‘Realme’ name has been trademarked under the ‘vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water’ in India. The trademark was filed by Realme Mobile Telecommunications (Shenzhen) Co Ltd back in late 2018. For reference only It is worth noting that Realme introduced its first smartphone, the Realme 1, in May of 2018 and within 40 days, its volumes got past the four lakh mark. The trademark application was filed just a few months later in October 2018. Filing a name trademark does not necessarily mean it will be used in the real world and sometimes it could be done so that others would not have the opportunity to exploit it. The name could be used for an electric two-wheeler brand but we do not have any official confirmation on it yet. However, considering the meteoric rise in the number of electric two-wheeler startup brands in recent years in India, Realme may fancy such an opportunity. It will have to be waited and seen how its approach will be in electric mobility if it decides to head that way. Ola Electric’s first zero-emission scooter with some unconventional promises could be closely watched by others and it may open up the door for brands from other greener pastures!

    "full_description": "Citing consumer complaints, regulators in the EU are proposing a common cellphone charger and have set their sights on Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) . In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers, Neil Patel, Demitri Kalogeropoulos, and Jason Hall consider whether Apple should be worried about this potential new legislation. Brian Withers: The headline is Apple faces off with Europe regulators, but wait, there's more, over phone chargers. Yeah, seriously, so EU is proposing that Apple that they consolidate all cellphones, all mobile phones into this USB, I think C thing that the Android phones use. That would effectively ban iPhones lightning port, the flat little piece that go in there and it says, I love this quote, \"European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible charges piling up in their drawers.\" They said in the press release, \"We gave the industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions. Now time is right for legislative action, for a common charger.\" Is this a good idea? Is this an overreach for the EU? Neil? [laughs] Neil Patel: I saw this new story in a daily newsletter. Again, I was like seriously, is this what we have to talk about today and this look making news? It's high level. I just think the EU's had it out for Big Tech. This is just another example of that. I think the EU's main goal here is the waste. I think there's other steps that we can take to clean up the environment than focus on this in what I think. The EU mentioned consumer complaints. Well, those same consumers are still buying the iPhone, and so it's not that big of a complaint that's turning them away from buying the actual product. Then I think Apple argued, well, if this does get implemented, first of all, it's only going to cost Apple like one billion dollars or something to change their manufacturing, so nothing to them. But Apple argue, well what happens to all of the lightning cords out there? That's going to create waste. I just think this is just an example of the EU trying to figure out another way to target a Big Tech company, and they are behind the curve. I mean, technology moves to fast. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Yeah. If they can make this change by Thanksgiving so we can all share each other's cords when we go home. [laughs] Jason Hall: Exactly. [laughs] Withers: That would be great. Kalogeropoulos: I was reading the article too. I was pretty amazed by the fact that if you look in the fine print there, this is a proposal that would have to be passed by the EU member states individually and then by the EU collectively, and then they would have to build in all this time for manufacturers to actually implement these recommendations once they do it and legislate it. As we know from the US that legislation takes a long time even under the best scenario. I think they were estimating this might be three years before this even impacted actual manufacturing. Who knows what the influence is going to look like in three years or probably wearing some version of it by then? I don't think Apple has much to worry about there. Hall: I think that actually this is a perfect example of why it's good the regulatory processes are glacial, is because by the time they figure out how to come up with something, it won't matter because we'll all be charging all of our devices wirelessly anyway. [laughs] Withers: That's what I'm hoping. Hall: It'll keep the regulators focusing on this thing instead of meddling in other stuff. [laughs] Everybody wins. Withers: Yeah. well, I am relieved that we're years away from making Apple change their plug.",

    "content": "Biotech stocks are in a slump. Despite numerous wins in the high-profile areas of COVID-19 and cancer therapy, the industry has failed to excite investors this year -- as seen in the 12% year-to-date fall in the the bellwether SPDR S&P Biotech ETF. Risk-tolerant growth investors appear to be favoring other vehicles over biotech in 2021, such as the red-hot cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB), electric-vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and emerging social media plays such as Digital World Acquisition (NASDAQ: DWAC) and Phunware (NASDAQ: PHUN).The reason for this broad shift in investor sentiment?

However, biotech stocks can rebound quickly after bad news. Should growth-oriented investors consider buying these beaten-down biotech stocks next week? Let's take a deeper dive to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Atea Pharmaceuticals: Has max pain been reached? Atea's shares crumbled last week after its Roche -partnered direct-acting antiviral pill, AT-527, flopped in a phase 2 trial for patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. The back story is that AT-527 was on track to possibly become a megablockbuster orally administered treatment for COVID-19. That investing thesis isn't completely off the table, as the drug is still making its way through a pivotal trial. Moreover, Atea and Roche are reportedly adding more high-risk COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions to this ongoing phase 3 trial, which ought to boost the drug's chances of success. But that all-important data readout is now expected to be delayed by up to six months. Can Atea's shares rebound? I think there's a reasonable chance that this small-cap biotech could indeed rebound in the weeks and months to come. The failed phase 2 trial for AT-527 contained both vaccinated patients and patients with milder forms of the disease. What's more, the drug did reportedly show a clinical benefit in higher-risk patients. The bad news is that Atea and Roche's oral COVID-19 pill would probably be the third one on the market if this phase 3 trial hits its primary endpoint. So while the megablockbuster sales thesis is probably out the window, AT-527 could still post some impressive sales at the end of the day. In short, Atea's stock will undoubtedly require investor patience, but it does come across as an intriguing rebound candidate. Agenus: A regulatory miscue Agenus, a small-cap cancer specialist, lost almost a quarter of its value last week. Shareholders hit the exits on this stock last week after the company announced that it had withdrawn the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the second-line cervical cancer drug known as balstilimab. The company did so in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s granting a full approval for Merck 's rival therapy, Keytruda, for this indication. Agenus also announced that it will discontinue the drug's ongoing confirmatory trial in this patient population, which ought to slash the company's research and development expenses by a healthy $100 million. Where do things stand now? My take is that investors overreacted to this news. Balstilimab's monotherapy indication as a treatment for advanced cervical cancer was never going to be a big moneymaker for the company. Agenus even admitted as much in its press release last week. By contrast, Agenus' next-generation checkpoint inhibitor therapies , and partnerships with the likes of Bristol Myers Squibb , Gilead Sciences , among others, will ultimately be the biotech's core value drivers. In fact, I think this tiny cancer company will have one of its partners buy it out within the next 12 months. The emerging trend in biopharma is to acquire promising cancer assets early in their developmental process, and Agenus has an expansive pipeline chock-full of those types of therapies. Novavax: Can this vaccine company deliver? Shares of vaccine developer Novavax plunged by almost 17% last week, following a Politico article claiming that the biotech's COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process may not be up to regulators' quality standards. The big deal is that the article's anonymous sources reported that the company could take until the end of 2022 to resolve these manufacturing issues and win regulatory authorizations for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. By then, the pandemic may be winding down, thereby lowering the demand for additional vaccines. So, in a worst-case scenario, Novavax's experimental COVID-19 vaccine may badly miss Wall Street's sky-high revenue projections in the coming years. Can Novavax adapt and overcome? The company has repeatedly missed its own regulatory submission deadlines for the vaccine this year, and it has no experience at scaling up its manufacturing process to bring a product to market. That's the bad news. The good news is that the company's management did note in a reponse to this article that it remains confident in its ability to produce high-quality vaccines at scale. If true, Novavax's stock should rebound nicely from this hefty downturn. The biotech's stock, after all, is currently trading at less than 2 times 2022 projected revenue -- which is dirt cheap for a biotech stock. Ocular Therapeutix: A key clinical setback Ocular Therapeutix saw its shares crater by 38% last week in response to a failed phase 2 trial for the dry-eye treatment OTX-CSI, a hydrogel insert containing the immunosuppressant medication cyclosporine. The biopharma and its shareholders had hoped that this experimental treatment would be a healthy revenue generator for the company in the years ahead. Those hopes, however, were dashed when the drug failed to boost tear production in this midstage trial. Can Ocular's stock recover this lost ground? I think there's a strong probability that this beaten-down biotech will recover, and perhaps quickly. The biotech has multiple upcoming clinical catalysts in the high-value areas of episodic dry-eye disease, glaucoma, and wet age-related macular degeneration. What's more, Ocular does have its FDA-approved eye inflammation drug, Dextenza, to fall back on. This single product is forecast to rake in over $250 million in peak sales, which is a fairly healthy revenue stream for a company with a $529 million market cap at present. Ocular's shares, therefore, might turn out to be a downright bargain after last week's massive sell-off.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin It’s great that so many have copies of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations , but very unfortunate that so few have read it. The alleged “supply chain” problems we’re enduring right now were explained by Smith in the book’s opening pages. Smith wrote about a pin factory, and the then remarkable truth that one man in the factory working alone could maybe – maybe – produce one pin each day. But several men working together could produce tens of thousands . Work divided is what enables the very work specialization that drives enormous productivity. If this was true in an 18 th century pin factory, imagine how vivid the truth is today. Figure that something as basic as the creation of a pencil is the consequence of global cooperation, so what kind of remarkable global symmetry leads to the creation of an airplane, car, or computer? The kind that can’t be planned is the short answer, but more realistically the only answer. Please keep this in mind as you read media coverage of the so-called “supply-chain disruptions” resulting in “shortages” that are said to be causing “inflation.” If you want a bigger laugh, read about what President Biden wants to do in order to get “supply” back on the market with an eye on replenishing U.S. retail shelves that are increasingly bare. He’s decreed 24-hour port operations! Yes, thanks to the 46 th president we now know what held the Soviets back, and ultimately destroyed the Soviet Union: their ports weren’t open long enough; thus the shortages of everything … All of the above would be funny if it weren’t so sad. Media members, “experts,” economists, and politicians don’t even disappoint anymore. To say they do would be to flatter them. In reality, they’re just fools. Either they think we have inflation, shortages, or a combination of both. Wrong on all counts. Really, who was talking about supply-chain shortages or inflation in early 2020? Very few were, and that’s because the U.S. economy was largely free then. At which point politicians panicked. And in panicking, they imposed a rather draconian form of command-and-control on the U.S. economy.

At which point it’s worth considering once again the simple pin factory that Smith witnessed in the 18 th century versus the global cooperation that was the norm 19 months ago. The supply lines of February 2020 were impossibly complicated structures that no politician could ever hope to design. Think billions of individuals around the world pursuing their narrow work specialization on the way to enormous global plenty. Put another way, the shelves in economically free countries were heaving with all manner of products based on economic cooperation that was staggering in scope. Brilliant as some experts claim to be, and brilliant as some politicians think they are as they look in the mirror, they could never construct the web of trillions of economic relationships that prevailed before the lockdowns. But they could destroy the web. And they did; that, or they severely impaired it. In which case let’s please not insult reason by talking about “shortages” or “inflation” now. Let’s instead be realistic and talk about central planning. We know from the 20 th century that when politicians, authoritarians or both substitute their intensely narrow knowledge for that of the marketplace that immense want for very little (and lousy) supply is the logical result. Yes it is. When we’re not economically free, bare shelves are the logical result. Conversely, product and service abundance is a certain consequence yet again of the infinite actions and trillions of economic relationships entered into by billions of people. These commercial tie-ups were constructed by consenting individuals over many years and many decades only for them to be wrecked by a political class arrogantly seeking to protect us from ourselves. That’s what happens when command-and-control replaces voluntary order. The remunerative ties that bind us fray, or vanish altogether. Consenting, remunerative economic activity was suddenly illegal. Yet politicians and other experts are only now wringing their hands about a lack of supply? Really, what did they think was going to happen? While politicians couldn’t ever create or legislate billions working together around the world, they could and can surely break voluntary economic arrangements. When you have guns, handcuffs, the power to quite literally shut off power sources to the productive, not to mention the wealth produced by the productive, you have the power to impose command-and-control. And so they did, only for the “supply chains” painstakingly created in self-interested but spontaneous form over many decades to suddenly break apart. Just don’t call it inflation, or shortages. Inflation is a devaluation of the unit of account. In our case it’s the devaluation of the dollar. And while Treasury hasn’t always done a great job as the dollar’s steward over the decades, that’s just the point. Devaluation was routine problem in the 1970s, it ceased to be in the 80s and 90s, but it reared its ugly head once again during the George W. Bush administration in the early 2000s. To say inflation is a “now” thing is to ignore that it’s more realistically been a 21 st century-long thing. We don’t suddenly have an inflation problem. To say we do is the equivalent of saying that the Soviets had inflation because all the goods worth getting were both difficult to find, and incredibly expensive if they could be found. In our case we’ve had a lockdown problem care of nail-biting politicians that suffocated commercial cooperation around the world. And with work divided less than it used to be care of government force, productivity is naturally lower than it used to be. Please consider modern productivity in terms of Smith’s pin factory example yet again, and ask what it would do to supply. The only thing is supply shortfalls are not evidence of inflation. A rise in one price due to lack of supply implies a fall in the other price. In short, we have a central planning problem. Were he around today, Adam Smith could diagnose this in seconds.",

In Snap's case, the surprise was to the downside. But that's not always the case. As earnings season continues to unfold, two Wall Street darlings are set to report their latest quarterly results this week. Social network Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) reports after market close on Monday and e-commerce and cloud-computing giant Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) reports after market close on Thursday. Here's a preview of the two growth stocks ' reports. Image source: Getty Images. Facebook After Friday's news of Snap's revenue miss due to global supply and labor shortages, as well as recent changes to advertising tracking and measurement on iOS, investors will be looking to see if Facebook was caught up in the same headwinds. Analysts, on average, expect Facebook to report revenue of $29.6 billion, up about 38% compared to the company's revenue in the year-ago period. This is a deceleration from Facebook's 56% revenue growth in Q2; although Facebook's second quarter of 2021 was helped by an easy year-ago comparison when advertising revenue was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related lockdowns. After Snap's revenue miss on Friday, many investors are likely now expecting Facebook's revenue and top-line guidance for Q4 to be below analyst estimates. But it's always possible that the social network comes out unscathed from the challenges Snap detailed last week. There are certainly some reasons to think Facebook could at least avoid some of the iOS headwinds; unlike Snap, Facebook has a meaningful presence on desktop as well -- not just mobile. Amazon E-commerce and cloud-computing giant Amazon could be similarly impacted by global supply and labor shortages. Its e-commerce business will almost certainly be affected in some way. The question, therefore, is if the guidance management provided when it released its second-quarter results baked in these challenges enough. After all, it was already clear that global supply and labor shortages would be a problem in Q3 and the during the holiday season. Many inventory-dependent companies were discussing these issues in their earnings calls, and most didn't expect challenges to subside until 2022. Amazon guided for third-quarter revenue to increase 10% to 16% year over year -- a significant slowdown from the 27% growth the company posted in Q2. Analysts, on average, are expecting the company's third-quarter revenue to come in toward the high end of its guidance. Equally as important as Amazon's third-quarter results will be its guidance for Q4. The important holiday quarter typically represents a large portion of the company's revenue and an even bigger share of its profits. Will global supply and labor shortages hold back the company during the important holiday quarter? Analysts are modeling for fourth-quarter revenue of $142 billion, up 13% year over year. Facebook and Amazon report earnings after market close on Oct. 25 and Oct. 28, respectively.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin French navy Rear Adm. Eric Malbrunot, right, deputy chief of naval operations for plans and ... [+] programs, receives a brief from Capt. Paul Lanzilotta, USS Gerald R. Ford’s (CVN 78) commanding officer, on the ship’s flight deck design. US NAVY September’s surprise AUKUS agreement on submarines may have opened a rift between them, but Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron can heal wounded Franco-US relations when they meet in Rome later this month by focusing upon a different high-value asset: aircraft carriers. Closer maritime coordination makes sense. As both France and the US seek to secure massive exclusive economic zones, they have a common interest in enhancing maritime security, law enforcement, and legal norms at sea. Deeper collaboration on aircraft carriers is a great place to start. AUKUS Made It Awkward, But French And American Strategic Interests Remain Aligned. For most of October, American diplomats have been shuttling through Paris , conducting damage control after the announcement of the tripartite “AUKUS” defense agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. French anger at the poorly communicated strategic snub was exacerbated by the simultaneous collapse of Australia’s $65 billion deal to buy 12 “Shortfin” Barracuda Class submarines from France. Presidents Biden and Macron are slated to meet at the G-20 summit in Rome between Oct. 30 and 31, where they will reportedly discuss a host of relationship-building projects. Macron faces the polls in just six months , and will be looking for wins that will play well for a domestic audience while also advancing his longstanding interest of enhancing France’s strategic autonomy. Ideally, Macron would return from the G-20 with an image-boosting set of high-profile and high-tech collaborations capable of offsetting the bad feelings around the “AUKUS” snub. While America’s rapprochement with France will be a multifaceted affair covering a range of issues, deepening the already collaborative Franco-American approach to maritime affairs offers an easy route to a high-profile G-20 “win” for both parties. MORE FOR YOU American Airlines Pilots Say Operations Managers Must Go After Summer Breakdowns The U.S. Air Force Is Gradually Rebuilding Its B-52 Bombers From The Rivets Out An American Bomber Visited Malaysia. A Bizarre Mix Of Local Jets Rose To Meet It. While America is eager to address a range of maritime security challenges, France is at the early stages of an aircraft carrier recapitalization program. Its existing carrier, FS Charles de Gaulle (R91), is set to retire in the late 2030’s. To replace the aging flat-top, France intends to build a mid-sized nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and has approached the U.S. for technological support. This would be an easy win. America and France are already working together on these maritime issues. Affirming a deeper collaborative approach to these two outstanding strategic needs offers real value for both parties. Collaboration O n A ircraft Carriers Is A Natural Next Step. In terms of prestige and power in the maritime, the only vessel that matches the strategic value of the nuclear submarine is the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. America and France have a lot to offer each other in a shared aircraft carrier project. America has the raw technology, integration expertise and the widest experience with carrier designs. France, by developing a smaller carrier of about 75,000 tons, offers the U.S. risk-reduction and a proof-of-principle demonstration of modern small-carrier utility. In a few years, America may want a smaller carrier design. Despite having one new massive, 100,000-ton Ford class supercarrier emerging from a lengthy test-and-trial period—and three more copies on the way—strategists and Pentagon budget-watchers continually balance the utility of America’s big carriers against their enormous cost. And while America has a lot of experience with Forrestal class-sized carriers , it has been over fifty years since the U.S. Navy’s last 60,000 ton (light) aircraft carrier entered service. America’s understanding of the various design trade-offs in a mid-sized carrier could use a modern refresh and France is uniquely positioned to provide that. EMALS Gives An Edge. France, of course, is eager to exploit EMALS, America’s new electromagnetic “launch-and-recovery” system. Catapult systems are at the heart of aircraft carrier design—and were, ironically enough, originally advanced by joint U.S. and U.K. collaboration. France needs the launch and recovery technology to operate heavier aircraft. America and France are already working to get EMALS into France’s next carrier. Formal discussions began in late 2018, when both countries signed a “Letter of Offer and Acceptance for a Study Case,” a first step in transferring high-tech military hardware. “Rough Order of Magnitude” cost estimates were presented in 2019. Technical discussions continued, and, in December 2020, President Macron announced the carrier project was moving ahead. In April, French Maj. Gen. Nicolas Hué, head of management unit, mission and support aircrafts, French Armaments Procurement Agency (DGA) and Rear Adm. Eric Malbrunot, deputy chief of naval operations for plans and programs for the French Navy joined USS Gerald R. Ford’s (CVN-78) final independent steaming event of post-delivery test and trials. Notional specifications reported by Naval News suggest that the new French carrier will wield three EMALS catapults, with one possibly dedicated to drone launches. Getting EMALS onto another, smaller platform—and potentially converted into a smaller form-factor—is exceedingly useful. Understanding how the electromagnetic launch system integrates into a smaller vessel is particularly beneficial, potentially opening opportunities to place EMALS onto smaller flat-decks both in the U.S. and elsewhere overseas. With more users chalking up experience with EMALS, the operational parameters of the system can get worked out far faster. Testing the platform under different loads, conditions, and maintenance regimes will only help strengthen the reliability of the launch and recovery system while speeding the development of use profiles for aircraft of different weights and acceleration tolerances. Different operational and maintenance practices may reveal efficiencies. Working together on these basic functional enablers is a necessary route to interoperability. Both parties will win. Even something as specialized as EMALS offers opportunities for mutually beneficial collaborative opportunities in maritime surveillance. With the U.S. Coast Guard actively working to develop tactical and theatre-level unmanned surveillance platforms, the prospect of expanding coverage—exploring, for example, electromagnetic launch-and-recovery systems that enable drone utilization from smaller patrol vessels, austere islands, or vessels-of-opportunity—would be a game changer. The prospect of launching and recovering an interoperable network of high-endurance unmanned surveillance aircraft from France’s low-cost Mistral class amphibious assault ships and the equally cost-effective Lewis B. Puller class Expeditionary Mobile Bases offers an interesting challenge for both countries. Coordination In Contested Exclusive Economic Zones With sprawling exclusive economic zones, France and America have a shared interest in maintaining an orderly maritime. France has several strategically placed overseas territories in increasingly contested areas. Both countries face a daunting challenge of monitoring more than 4.3 million square miles of sea; building shared sea surveillance, analysis and response resources makes sense. Collaborations are already underway. At sea, both countries regularly demonstrate aircraft carrier interoperability, cruising together and sharing flight decks. France and the U.S. Coast Guard participate in Canada’s Operation Nanook and conduct other multinational military and Search and Rescue exercises. Joint work with Interpol on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and continued coordination in Oceania offer a strong foundation for building a deeper working relationship between these two advocates for a more orderly ocean. The U.S. Coast Guard is also building collaborative partnerships and surveillance networks to track and roll back illicit behaviors in the maritime. And the U.S., as it works with France on their new carrier, will continue to mull the prospect of fielding smaller, lower-cost aircraft carriers. Quickly repackaging these ongoing collaborations into a deeper, more strategically meaningful portfolio of high-profile projects is an easy lift. Even with the tensions from AUKUS, the sea offers a solid foundation of shared interest between France and the United States. When Presidents Biden and Macron meet later this month at the G-20, they should capitalize on the opportunity, healing the rift caused by a submarine deal with something just as valuable for both countries – functional aircraft carriers fit for the future.",

    "content": "On October 22 at 4:52 p.m. (EDT), a miner that acquired 50 bitcoin on May 17, 2010, spent the funds that sat idle for 11 years and five months. There hasn’t been a 2010 block reward spent in three months and the last time a 2010 miner spent their ‘sleeping bitcoin’ was on July 4, 2021. After waiting patiently for more than a decade, the miner who spent the ‘sleeping bitcoin’ on Friday saw a percentage gain of 76,249,900% if the individual cashed out into U.S. dollars today. Old School Miner Spends 2010 Block Reward After Bitcoins Sat for More Than a Decade It’s been a while since a block reward of 2010 ‘sleeping bitcoins’ have been spent and on Friday, a block reward from that era was transferred after sitting for 11 years and five months. Prior to Friday’s 2010, block reward spend, the last 2010 block transferred was on July 4, 2021. Bitcoin.com News, alongside help from the creator of the blockchain parser btcparser.com, and members of the Telegram channel “Gold Found In Sand,” have been identifying these old school miners from 2010 and other years for quite some time. The block reward spent on Friday came from a mining reward acquired on May 17, 2010, and was transferred at block height 706,203. On September 28, 2021, an in-depth report on ‘sleeping bitcoins,’ showed that old school miners from 2010 through 2013 had moved $1 billion in BTC (using exchange rates from the day the study published) or 23,250 BTC transferred. 2010 Block Reward Transfers Become Infrequent, Friday’s Transfer Would Net 76 Million Percent in Gains if Sold for USD The 2010 block reward move on Friday, if exchanged for fiat would be worth over $3.1 million, as bitcoin (BTC) opened the day on Friday exchanging hands for $62,237 per unit. Remarkably, when the bitcoin miner acquired the coins, the entire lot was only worth $4. The miner decided to wait and not spend it at $0.08 per unit, which was the price equivalent of a single bitcoin in June-July 2010. The miner would manage to gain a whopping 76,249,900% increase in value if he or she decided to trade the funds for fiat that day. Meanwhile as mentioned above, 2010 block reward spends have been far and few between during the last four months. Although, there’s been a greater number of 2011 block reward transfers. Prior to Friday’s 2010 block, 13 block rewards from 2011 were moved on the blockchain in October alone. Using exchange rates from October 23, that’s $39.5 million in value if exchanged for fiat. This is because the terms “spent” or “spend” in this article do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party like a popular crypto exchange. The 2010 transfer on October 22, did not see the corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoinsv (BSV) moved. Those coins remain idle to this day as the stash of BCH is worth $31,312 and the BSV is worth $8,595 at the time of writing. All 2010 block rewards mined in that era will have BCH and BSV tethered to the private keys, alongside the myriad of lesser-known BTC forks. Additionally, the mystery whale that was caught by Bitcoin.com News and help from btcparser.com, has not returned to move strings of bitcoin rewards in over three months. The last time we caught the infamous 2010 mining whale was on June 9, 2021, at block height 686,865. The whale was quite special because it constantly spent 1,000 BTC or 20 block rewards from 2010 in a single block. We cannot say whether or not the whale that constantly spent 20 block rewards from 2010 will not return. Prior to the June 9 spend of 1,000 ‘sleeping bitcoin,’ worth $35 million at the time of transfer, the whale waited 78 days to come back.

    "full_description": "From $4 to Over $3.1 Million — Miner Transfers 50 'Sleeping Bitcoin' After BTC Sat Idle for 11 Years On October 22 at 4:52 p.m. (EDT), a miner that acquired 50 bitcoin on May 17, 2010, spent the funds that sat idle for 11 years and five months. There hasn’t been a 2010 block reward spent in three months and the last time a 2010 miner spent their ‘sleeping bitcoin’ was on July 4, 2021. After waiting patiently for more than a decade, the miner who spent the ‘sleeping bitcoin’ on Friday saw a percentage gain of 76,249,900% if the individual cashed out into U.S. dollars today. Old School Miner Spends 2010 Block Reward After Bitcoins Sat for More Than a Decade It’s been a while since a block reward of 2010 ‘sleeping bitcoins’ have been spent and on Friday, a block reward from that era was transferred after sitting for 11 years and five months. Prior to Friday’s 2010, block reward spend, the last 2010 block transferred was on July 4, 2021. Bitcoin.com News, alongside help from the creator of the blockchain parser btcparser.com , and members of the Telegram channel “Gold Found In Sand,” have been identifying these old school miners from 2010 and other years for quite some time. The block reward spent on Friday came from a mining reward acquired on May 17, 2010, and was transferred at block height 706,203. A visual perspective of the May 17, 2010 block reward transfer (red dot) from theholyroger.com’s The (Not) ‘Satoshi Bags’ Tracker. On September 28, 2021, an in-depth report on ‘sleeping bitcoins,’ showed that old school miners from 2010 through 2013 had moved $1 billion in BTC (using exchange rates from the day the study published) or 23,250 BTC transferred. 2010 Block Reward Transfers Become Infrequent, Friday’s Transfer Would Net 76 Million Percent in Gains if Sold for USD The 2010 block reward move on Friday, if exchanged for fiat would be worth over $3.1 million, as bitcoin ( BTC ) opened the day on Friday exchanging hands for $62,237 per unit. Remarkably, when the bitcoin miner acquired the coins, the entire lot was only worth $4. The miner decided to wait and not spend it at $0.08 per unit, which was the price equivalent of a single bitcoin in June-July 2010 . The miner would manage to gain a whopping 76,249,900% increase in value if he or she decided to trade the funds for fiat that day. Meanwhile as mentioned above, 2010 block reward spends have been far and few between during the last four months. Although, there’s been a greater number of 2011 block reward transfers. Prior to Friday’s 2010 block, 13 block rewards from 2011 were moved on the blockchain in October alone. Using exchange rates from October 23, that’s $39.5 million in value if exchanged for fiat. This is because the terms “spent” or “spend” in this article do not necessarily mean that the bitcoins were “sold” to a third party like a popular crypto exchange. The 2010 transfer on October 22, did not see the corresponding bitcoin cash ( BCH ) or bitcoinsv ( BSV ) moved. Those coins remain idle to this day as the stash of BCH is worth $31,312 and the BSV is worth $8,595 at the time of writing. All 2010 block rewards mined in that era will have BCH and BSV tethered to the private keys, alongside the myriad of lesser-known BTC forks. Additionally, the mystery whale that was caught by Bitcoin.com News and help from btcparser.com, has not returned to move strings of bitcoin rewards in over three months. The last time we caught the infamous 2010 mining whale was on June 9, 2021, at block height 686,865. The whale was quite special because it constantly spent 1,000 BTC or 20 block rewards from 2010 in a single block. We cannot say whether or not the whale that constantly spent 20 block rewards from 2010 will not return. Prior to the June 9 spend of 1,000 ‘sleeping bitcoin,’ worth $35 million at the time of transfer, the whale waited 78 days to come back .

In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributor Jason Hall reviews a list of REITs he thinks are smart investments right now. Jason Hall: ROIC, Retail Opportunity Investments Corporation , this is a West Coast based Real Estate Investment Trust that focuses on strip malls. They're really good at finding ones that have anchor tenants like pharmacy, grocery that are relatively e-commerce resistant, therein, high-wealth areas. Digital Realty Trust , ticker DLR, Brian Withers, it might sound familiar to you. This is a really interesting data center. REITs, one of the things I like about them versus some of the others is they own most of their data centers and some of the other larger ones. Actually, they lease the space and then they lease space in the data center to the users, so they don't participate as much. There's some benefits in terms of debt model there, but I prefer Digital Realty Trust because they tend to own all of their underlying assets. STAG, ticker S-T-A-G Stag Industrial . This is a large industrial REIT that focuses on things like building distribution centers, small-scale manufacturing, logistics type operations, you think about more companies looking to in-source, you think about domestic manufacturing, you think about e-commerce, logistics. STAG Industrial is a great company to own. CareTrust REIT , ticker CTR-E. This is my favorites investment and other real estate investment trust, is my favorite investment in the trend of the aging baby boomers. About 10,000 baby boomers a day turn 65, that's going to continue for the next nine years. There's going to be 80 million baby boomers in the United States. There are going to be 80 million Americans by 2020-2029 that are 65 or older. There will be 40 million Americans that are 80 year older. We simply measure double from 2010. We simply don't have enough of the right housing, the right care facilities, a care facility is a small play on that opportunity. Realty Income , ticker O. Tax itself is the monthly dividend company. Dividend Aristocrats increases dividend every quarter [laughs] for like 26 years, it's an incredible story there. Let's see, EPR , so this is another interesting REIT that I like a lot. Peloton , this is one. This is not a REIT, it's not a high yield start. Brian Withers: It's not a dividends stuff. Jason Hall: I promised Jon Quast I was going to buy some, he convinced me on another real estate. I entered that position, and there's one more that I'm not going to mention. I'm going to be selfish, I'm not going to mention it, because I'm thinking about buying more on Monday.",

But make no mistake: American's third-quarter results were easily the worst of any major U.S. airline . The carrier expects to lose more money than any of its competitors in the fourth quarter, too. The lesson for investors is clear: steer clear of this troubled company. Another bad quarter Three months ago, many airlines expected to be profitable during the third quarter, thanks to a strong rebound in summer leisure travel. However, despite the improving demand environment, American Airlines never expected to turn a profit in Q3, mainly due to its high cost structure and crippling interest costs. Management's initial guidance called for American to log an adjusted pre-tax margin between -3% and -7%, with revenue down 20% from the third quarter of 2019. Adding to the airline's woes, demand stalled out near the beginning of August as U.S. COVID-19 case numbers surged. In early September, American Airlines slashed its quarterly forecast, saying that it expected revenue to fall 24% to 28% from Q3 2019, leading to an adjusted pre-tax margin between -10% and -14%. Ultimately, American's third-quarter revenue totaled $9 billion, down 25% from two years ago. The company recorded an adjusted pre-tax loss of $833 million, putting its adjusted pre-tax margin at -9.3%: better than its most recent forecast but still considerably worse than its initial quarterly guidance. (American did earn a $169 million profit under generally accepted accounting principles , but that included a substantial benefit from the final batch of federal payroll support grants.) Image source: American Airlines. To put American's results in context, key rival Delta Air Lines ( NYSE:DAL ) reported a modest Q3 adjusted profit earlier this month. Meanwhile, United Airlines ( NASDAQ:UAL ) posted a smaller adjusted pre-tax loss of $473 million, which translated to a -6.1% adjusted pre-tax margin . The fourth quarter will be worse American Airlines' financial results will likely deteriorate further in the fourth quarter, which tends to be a seasonally weaker period for airlines. On Thursday, the company said that it expects revenue to fall 20% compared to Q4 2019 on 11% to 13% less capacity. Adding to the earnings pressure, nonfuel unit costs are on pace to rise 8% to 10% over that period and fuel prices could spike by roughly 20% compared to the $2.05 per gallon that American paid two years ago. Based on these projections, management expects American Airlines to report an awful -16% to -18% adjusted pre-tax margin this quarter. That implies a pre-tax loss of roughly $1.5 billion. Unless American beats these targets by a country mile, its Q4 financial results will lag those of Delta and United again. United Airlines' guidance implies an adjusted pre-tax loss of around $1 billion this quarter, and Delta Air Lines in turn will post a much smaller loss than United. Massive risk and little upside Analysts currently expect most U.S. airlines to earn substantial profits next year (assuming no additional pandemic-related setbacks). By contrast, the analyst consensus currently calls for American Airlines to earn a negligible profit in 2022. Image source: American Airlines. American Airlines' weak balance sheet makes its persistently weak profitability particularly dangerous. American ended last quarter with $38.3 billion of debt, plus around $15 billion of pension and lease liabilities. Moreover, the airline used over $1.7 billion of cash in its operations last quarter. Based on its weak Q4 earnings forecast, it will likely burn even more cash this quarter. To be fair, American ended last quarter with $14.5 billion of unrestricted cash and investments, giving it time to turn things around. However, the company has nearly $20 billion of debt maturing between now and the end of 2025. If American Airlines still isn't generating meaningful earnings and cash flow within a couple of years, it could struggle to repay or refinance all that debt. That creates substantial risk for investors. On the flip side, American Airlines' fully diluted market cap has rebounded beyond its January 2020 (i.e., pre-pandemic) level. Thus, investors aren't getting a discount for bearing this risk, making American Airlines stock extremely unattractive.",

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Tyler Matzek is the hub of the Braves model of run prevention baseball as a stout middle reliever. ... [+] He has made an extraordinary comeback in the game after his career nearly died. (Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images) Getty Images Tyler Matzek’s first strikeout victim as a Major League pitcher was Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman. It was June 11, 2014. Matzek was making his debut for the Colorado Rockies and whiffed Freeman on a 3 balls, 2 strikes slider going 83 miles per hour. It was a called strike three. Matzek, a left-hander from Southern California, who signed for a Rockies-record $3.9 million bonus as the 11 th pick overall in 2009, got his first win that day. He was 23 years old and on his way. And then he wasn’t. Matzek’s career got chaotic. He developed performance anxiety and mental problems cascaded. He couldn’t throw strikes and was a shipwreck. Matzek plainly called his problem “the yips” and he was utterly defeated by the game and dropped out of pro ball. He was so far gone Matzek didn’t even play baseball in 2017. When he decided to give it another try in 2018, he had to re-start his career with an independent team called the AirHogs in Arlington, Texas. It was his last chance to try and expunge the mental demons. And now look at him.

The Braves are going to the World Series for the first time since 1999. Matzek blistered the Dodgers throughout the series with a fastball/slider combination. One of the deepest lineups in the game managed one hit in 18 at bats off Matzek in his five appearances in the series. In Game 6 Sunday night, which was the Braves’ clinching 4-2 win, he entered in the top of the seventh with runners on second and third, none out, and Atlanta clinging to a 4-2 lead. Matzek struck out Albert Pujols, Steven Souza, Jr., and Mookie Betts. Matzek came back out in the eighth and retired the side in order, which included getting Chris Taylor, the LA hero of Game 5 with three home runs, on a ground out. He got the win. “It’s a dream,” Matzek said on the field after the game. “To be where I was, it’s just a dream.” Matzek has no problem telling you he was in a place of utter despair six years ago. The pressures of professional baseball had become too much. The Rockies demoted him in 2015 because of wildness and in one of his first outings in Triple-A he walked seven of the first 12 batters he faced. In one inning. “I had to work on my mentals and the physical stuff started to come back slowly after that,” he said. “It was seeing some psychiatrists and psychologists and getting the mental anxiety of playing baseball away from me and then going back out there to do what I could do.” He walked away from the game in 2017, but then decided to try one more time and that meant starting from scratch. He would play a simple game of catch with a throwing partner and it was maddening, but he dug in. “I’ve thrown a lot of baseballs to get to the point where I am able to repeat,” Matzek said. “A lot of times when I was playing catch my throwing partner had to stand up against a fence to stop the ball because I couldn’t hit him with the pitch. He would pick it up off the ground and throw it back to me.” When he signed with the AirHogs in 2018, Matzek pleaded with Billy Martin, Jr., the general manager, to let him stay with the club a full season and not give up on him quickly. He needed time to overcome his performance anxiety. “I said to Billy ‘I need to throw, I need to play baseball, can you give me one full year where you will not release me’,” Matzek said. “I got offers from other teams, but he said ‘I’ll guarantee it’.” Matzek struggled and was 3-8 in 22 games with a 5.89 ERA. “The team’s manager was saying, we don’t know what’s going on, we don’t know if we can keep you,” Matzek said, “but Billy stuck by his word, and said ‘We’re going to keep this guy, he’s going to go out there every fifth day and he’s going to throw the baseball’. “I am forever grateful to him for sticking to his word because I wouldn’t be here without him.” Martin, the son of the late New York Yankees manager by the same name, not only gave Matzek a chance, but he added some lubricant for his career, which was to return to throwing from a higher arm slot. Slowly, Matzek’s career regained traction. His trajectory turned north in mid-2019 when he signed with the Braves. In the two full seasons with Atlanta, Matzek has become the hub of the Braves’ modus operandi of run prevention baseball, which cares less for innings pitched by starters and more for relievers collecting outs one at a time. The left-handers out of the pen, A.J. Minter, Will Smith, and Matzek, frustrated the Dodgers throughout the series. Matzek and Minter, whose fastballs sit at 96 mph, are among the hardest throwing lefties in the game. Matzek has become a pitcher the Braves can trust with 14 scoreless outings of at least one inning in 16 postseason outings in 2020 and 2021. His postseason ERA is 1.42. Asked if he needles Freeman about the strike out, Matzek said, “Every chance I get, but it took me a while to get up the courage to say something to him.” That called strike three to Freeman seven seasons ago looked high, Matzek was told. “Freddie says that, too,” Matzek said with a laugh. “He remembered it. He said ‘You sure it was a strike?’ And I said ‘The ump called it’. We go back and forth about that all the time. “We’re teammates now. I can get away with it.” ** Tyler Matzek in his Major League debut vs. Freddie Freeman.",

There are many interesting projects in youthful stages right now, but one of the most prominent NFT projects to arise recently is CryptoDragons. The project is currently offering a limited collection of 10,000 NFT dragon Eggs for minting. The uniqueness of each individual Egg illustration has been generated through Artificial Intelligence, facilitating a process where the technology creates art. Once the Eggs hatch a unique firstborn Dragon will be minted. It can earn, battle on blockchain Arena, give offspring to the CryptoDragons Metaverse. This means that the initial 10,000 Eggs can be an investment, providing Egg owners an opportunity to generate an offspring of unique NFT dragons. The DNA of a dragon can consist of a genome package of 12,000 possible attributes. The project uses the term “Egg Today, Dragon Tomorrow” to outline the roadmap of the Metaverse. Notably, the team has created four main dragons classes, which include Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. The Rare variety can be found as a result of dragon breeding. In addition to the unique approach to NFT art, CryptoDragons is also the first project to share 50% of its earnings. As the current limited collection of 10,000 NFTs eventually grows, the project promises to share 50% of its earnings from all breeding income with Legendary Dragon owners, meaning a serious sum of Ethereum can be earned. The online earning calculator on CryptoDragons’ website estimates that a Legendary Dragon owner could potentially earn equivalent to 7.2 ETH for 100,000 breedings and 5 million breedings can potentially generate 361.1 ETH. Dragon owners organize battles with other dragons via the Dragon Arena. Kassis, a Dragon language with its phonetic standards and alphabet, will be utilized. Overall, CryptoDragons is looking to be a highly exceptional NFT project. Not only it provides a unique take on NFTs by generating its art through special algorithms, but it is also allowing users to use these NFTs for entertainment purposes in its very own Metaverse. On top of providing an Ethereum investment opportunity, it’s a project that looks to have some potential for the future. All-in-all, the project will evolve into a fully functional dragon Metaverse, allowing dragon owners experience also on iOS and Android platforms.

    "full_description": "If your goal is to build out a diverse portfolio of at least 25 stocks, it may be daunting to think about how to afford this kind of investment on a budget. In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers, Jason Hall, Demitri Kalogeropoulos, and Neil Patel offer their strategies for managing a diverse long-term stock portfolio. Brian Withers: Bhanu asked, \"Motley Fool Premium members,\" which we are talking to Premium members here this afternoon, \"get more stock recommendations than capital they have, or is it me or do other feels the same?\" Yes, I totally get that, Bhanu. You are not alone by any stretch. \"If one has 30-35 stocks, how do you use the Fool services, take new positions from every service, or expanding existing positions that are doing good when your capital is limited.\" Anybody want to take a crack at that one? Jason Hall: I'll jump in real quick with just a quick 20 seconds on this, because this is something I've thought about a lot and I've been involved in some capacity with a lot of the services as a contractor over the years. I think what you have to be careful with is the fact that particularly a lot of the real money portfolios, their portfolio construction, and you run the risk if you start cherry-picking. Particularly like if you look at 10x, or rising stars, or some of these really high-growth ones. These portfolios are built on the idea that 20 percent of those stocks are going to generate 80 percent or more of the gains. If they recommend 30 stocks in a portfolio or 40 stocks in a portfolio and you buy eight or 10, it's really easy because of our individual biases to pick eight or 10 that you're familiar with or you like already, and you miss some businesses that you just don't know anything about. I think the fact that with zero trading fees and fractional investing, basically, all of the top discount brokers allow that. I think if you're going to pay up, you're going to pay the price to join these sorts of services. Set aside enough capital that even if you're only putting it $100 or $200 per stock. I think the smartest way to get the returns that these portfolios are trying to generate that you're signing up for, is even if you have a small bit of each one of them, your best thing is to buy them all, or you have to invest a lot of time and really do the true due diligence to pick the ones that you want. I think that you almost have to take advantage of it the best way by just break up your capital and do some fractional investing. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: That's a good point. I would just add, Jason, that I haven't thought about this question so much, but just off the top of my head. That's a good problem to not have, number 1, you have a lot of good businesses are doing some amazing things today, and so that's exciting. But what's worked personally for me, if you look at it in terms of a company that you like, something that you're connected to, something that you admire, something that you're likely to hold on to for a long time, you understand it. Those kind of companies, the ones I would tend to want to purchase. Just I think the first company I ever bought was a Motley Fool recommendation, it's Marvel . You guys would know that one, of course. Hall: That worked out OK. Kalogeropoulos: It worked out OK and then [laughs] it's the reason I own so much Disney right now. But I remember one of my first experiences as an investor just been like I went to an Iron Man movie and I just remember reading about that in the quarterly reports and then they release it, and then I went to the theaters to watch the movie and just feeling that cool like I own a piece of this movie sort of thing. That feeling I think it's going to help you hold on to the stock for a lot longer. Usually, that's the best predictor of your returns going over the long term. A company that you admire, I would tilt in that direction if you can. Neil Patel: I'll just add quickly, like we talked about earlier, just depends how much time you're willing to put into this. If you don't have extra time then buying, like Jason said, putting a small amount of money into the total portfolio is the best way to go. Because if you're just going to cherry-pick stocks, there's a chance you're going to miss out on the losers, there is a chance you're going to miss out on the big winners. You're not putting in a time to figure that out. If you're just taking that by your gut check. So it depends. Like Demitri said, if you are willing to put the time in companies, number 1, that you understand, that are simple, that you're interested in, it's a good place to start, and something that you're going to keep tabs on going forward. This is a fluid dynamic thing where you're following a company hopefully for five years or longer. So you want to have a company that you can grasp fully that you will take the time to pay attention to. It goes to the points that both you guys made.",

    "full_description": "By now, the investing world is familiar with the collapse of the company Theranos and its continuing fallout. In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers, Demitri Kalogeropoulos, and Jason Hall discuss the lessons that the Theranos situation can teach investors about evaluating risky companies. Brian Withers: I wanted to talk a little bit about the Elizabeth Holmes situation. The trial is finally getting underway. You might have heard of a company that she founded called Theranos. You might remember that she was on the cover of Fortune, in 2014. I didn't realize that she founded the company in 2003 when she was 19, [laughs] I didn't realize that part, she was quite young. At peak, right around 2014-2015, the company was valued at $10 billion based on some of the investments that they've made. But in 2015 and 2016, the Wall Street Journal started reporting on issues at the company and things started to unravel, and the company finally collapsed in 2018. If you're not familiar with the story, there's a really neat movie on HBO called, I think The Inventor, they did a really nice job. They interfaced real clips of the company and things happening there with discussions with the Wall Street Journal reporters, and the folks that broke the story, and some of the folks on the insiders, absolutely fascinating. But this is a story of things that went terribly wrong for investors. Back to the debt thing, we're looking at how mistakes get made and we're trying not to have repeat issues. Are there criteria that you consider beyond the must-not-have [laughs] when looking at companies to invest in? Whether it's history of losses, SEC investigations, whatnot. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: If I'm first interested in a company, doing a broad look at it, if I see the phrase \"material weakness\", automatic red flag goes up. There's two things. The material weakness was some long time in the past and the company has course-corrected, improved their controls, and that's a good thing. That might be a good thing because it led the company to tighten up their financial process. But if it's something more recent, then that's a red flag. There are so many high-quality companies, like what we just talked about, just in the Fool universe, there's hundreds of good stocks out there. You don't need to be investing in companies that have questionable accounting practices that have an SEC regulatory overhead that you have to deal with, and that are in the news all the time, that kind of thing. Material weakness is something to stay away from, specially for beginner investors who aren't really digging into the true meaning of what that is. Another thing that a lot of people might not think of that I pay attention to is, so I like companies whose CEOs or founders write shareholder letters. That's just to get a sense of how the CEO talks, what he focuses on, how he communicates with investors. If you hear a CEO in their letter or in their quarterly conference calls talk about the stock price, that to me is a red flag. A perfect example is the whole GE fiasco 15 years ago, where I think the company was manipulating sales numbers, and then Jack Welch was [inaudible 04:40:47] and they brought a new CEO in. The whole thing went [inaudible 04:40:51] when both of those CEOs would talk about stock price, would talk about the PE multiple on their earnings calls. I don't want my CEO of the company I'm investing in focus on that. I want them focused on the day to day operations, how are they going to steer the company over the next five years. Then again, just another point I'd like to add is, I don't necessarily turn away from a company who's had a history of losses, especially in today's economy where you have a lot of these fast-growing high-tech businesses who are constantly investing in the business. A history of losses wouldn't necessarily turn me away, but I think the main thing is that material weakness in the company's accounting controls. Withers: Demitri, what's your perspective on this? Kalogeropoulos: I agree with that too. I was just echo a lot of that. I would definitely say you mentioned SEC investigation. I think that's one of those cases where it makes sense, I guess we like to rag on Wall Street for being too short-term focused and over-reacting to things. But I think the announcement of an SEC investigation into your accounting practices is one of those situations where it makes sense to overreact. I totally understand it. There's that saying in the justice system where you're innocent until proven guilty, but that's not the way it works with an SEC investigation. At least on Wall Street, when there's an announcement that regulators suspect you of cooking the books, it's not uncommon to see a stock drop. That seem stock dropped 50, 60, 80 percent in that day. I understand why because we're calling in to question your financial statements, the way you've been presenting yourself to us. If we investors can't trust the numbers that you gave us to evaluate you on, then we don't really have a basis to invest. The other thing is, call this another saying, but if you've heard of, if you found one cockroach, it's probably not the only one. [laughs] I think it makes sense. It's not a place where I would give a management team a whole lot of leeway here. If there's one instance of regulatory misstatement like that, there will probably will be more and I'm not going to be sitting around to wait for the other shoe to drop. I'm also not going to be interested in your stock. You might be attracted to a company whose share is 50 percent cheaper today than it was yesterday just because of this one investigation. But I don't even know playing that game. There's a lot of other higher-quality places you can invest. Jason Hall: I'm going to read this as you put on the outline, Demitri, \"If I can't trust your financials, we have no basis to do business together.\" That's says it so well. For me, this is really what it boils down to with most penny-stocks. I think something a lot of people don't realize is, especially the uninitiated investor thinks that, and they may read an article that says, Apple 's shares traded for split adjusted 10 cents a share when it went public, and they don't understand it was never 10 cents a share. It was $35 a share, but various split since then. They think they have to buy stocks that are literally trading for pennies to make money without understanding that so many of those companies, because of their size, actually fall below SEC thresholds when they have to submit audited financial statements. Penny-stocks, because of this, they're rife for fraud because they're essentially built as the perfect thing to put fraudulent information or to be incredibly creative with things because you don't have to run it through one of the big auditing firms, one of the big accountancy firms and then the auditor signs off on it, and then you submit it to the SEC. Substantially lowers the threshold for what shows up in these filings and creates enormous risk. What they're telling you is not necessarily accurate and some cases, it's absolutely not true. I think that's a really important thing to understand about penny stocks and why I won't do business with penny-stocks, and God, we trust all others pay cash.",

In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers, Jason Hall, Neil Patel, and Demitri Kalogeropoulos talk about how much savings you should have in place and other things to consider before you quit. Brian Withers: It's been called the great resignation. This has been in the news for a month or so now as many workers are just up and quitting and leaving without another job, whether they are forced to get back in the office or just have had enough and want a new career path. There's a recent Wall Street Journal article that talks about how to prepare your finances for this event. I'll stick it in the Slido so you can read that. But I wanted to ask you, three experts, what advice would you have for a friend or family member who asked you what they should do to prepare to quit? Is there a financial advice you'd give them or other advice? Jason, I know you've walked away from a big job, so I'm going to put you on the spot first. Jason Hall: Yes. I did this almost 10 years ago now to start writing for the Fool, but I did not do it until I had a margin of safety in place. That margin of safety in this case, my wife took a full-time job at the company she works for now, which immediately meant that we'd be able to have healthcare and other benefits through her. We had that margin of safety in place for me to walk away from being the primary breadwinner and to take on the risk as a freelance writer. I had no track record as a writer and I made the jump. Obviously, it's paid off really well. A big part of the reason it paid off is that I wasn't stressed about health insurance. I wasn't concerned. I didn't also run out and get another part-time job or some gig to bridge the income gap, then I wasn't able to focus fully on the thing that I was going to do. That's the first advice I would give to anybody, is make sure you have a margin of safety in place so you can really give what you're trying to do a shot, if you're trying to build something on your own. If you just want to better job, having a job is incredible leverage, you're giving up that leverage. If you're going to go out there and compete against other people, you're far more attractive and you have more negotiating power if you keep your job until you find your job. Neil Patel: I think you make a great point, Jason, and that's what I was going to emphasize is the margin of safety and the flexibility is absolutely paramount. When you're at that point quitting your job or your mentality is, the grass is always greener, so you think of yourself on the other side and how great things are going to be, and you don't really give yourself that cushion, that flexibility for unexpected things that happen. I think setting yourself up for that is the most important thing. The emergency fund, thinking of all of the new costs or expenses that you'll have, the lower income you'll have, thinking about all those things before you do that I think it's absolutely crucial. You hit every nail on the head that I was going to say, Jason. Definitely, margin of safety is the most important thing and think through your entire budget line item by line item to make sure you are prepared and some for the uncertainty that that's going to happen going forward. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Totally agree with you guys. I guess the rule of thumb I would've like is just generally to have around 3-6 months worth of expenses in cash just all the time available as a cushion. But if you're making a decision like this where I'm giving up a steady cash flow for a risky situation, I think you might want to think about maybe doubling whatever that number is for you. The other thing I would tell the person, if you can find a way to try this new thing, if you're going into a new career or you're tired of this industry that you're in and you want to give another one a shot, I don't think it's ever been so easy to try that. Give it a shot before. They call it the gig economy. There are apps on the phone that allow you to be obviously a taxi driver if you want for a few weeks, you can be a bed and breakfast manager with Airbnb for a while, you can be a chef. There's hundreds of different things you can try and have clients. I would advise, give that a shot, give it some time to figure out, do you like it? You might hate it or it might tell you something about different ways you want to take that career. I believe I had a similar story to Jason's, but I believe I wrote part-time for the Fool for a couple of years before I quit my day job. At that point, I was very comfortable, I felt good about what I was doing and I thought it made sense to take that leap. Withers: Yeah. You guys are all bringing great points to the table. I'm just going to underscore the piece on the safety fund, the emergency fund. In 2009, I was working at Dow and in early March of 2009, I got laid off, which ended up being the low point of the market for those couple of years. I ended up selling stocks because I didn't have an emergency fund to cover expenses and I didn't know how long I was going to be out of work and we ended up moving from Nashville, Tennessee to San Antonio, Texas. Not only in order to get another job, we have to sell the house, scrimp expenses, we had to move across the country too. It was a traumatic experience. I think you should at least cheers to go in and try new things. Kalogeropoulos: Yeah, absolutely. Withers: I think, absolutely. I think this is more than any other time that I've seen, this is an absolutely great time to go try a new direction for your career or whatever. But do it with a little foresight and don't leave yourself completely exposed and put yourself in a stressful situation where you are uncomfortable financially. Hall: It's not a good idea to walk on a tightrope for the first-time without a safety net if you've never been on a tightrope before. Withers: [laughs] Yeah, here we go. Patel: Treat it like your in investments, it's a calculated risk.",

(Photo by Cole Burston/Getty Images) Getty Images While top overall pick Cade Cunningham has yet to make his NBA debut due to an ankle injury , his fellow classmates of the 2021 draft have picked up the slack in the early goings of the new season. So let's check in on three players who have hit the ground running. Evan Mobley - Forward, Cleveland Cavaliers The numbers: 35.3 minutes, 15.7 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.3 blocks, 1.3 steals, 63.0 TS% As the third overall pick, Mobley came into the league with a lot of promise . So far he's lived up to the hype. While it usually takes big men a while to adjust to the league, the 7-footer seems comfortable being a shot-taker and making passes on the fly. While some might argue that Cleveland's lack of talent creates the best environment for a young player to stuff the stat-sheet, that hasn't exactly been the case for Mobley. The 20-year-old has played within the flow of the offense, and made himself available close to the basket to get easy points. 62.5% of his shot attempts come from within 10 feet of the basket, but that isn't necessarily fair representation of his diverse game. Mobley has three-point range and his jump-shot mechanics are sound and fluid. In time, Mobley will assuredly rely more on his shooting ability than he is now, while also mixing it up inside.

That's lot of size, which makes it even more impressive that Mobley has carved out his own production. Scottie Barnes - Forward, Toronto Raptors The numbers: 32.7 minutes, 18.0 points, 10.0 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.3 steals, 57.0 TS% Picked right after Mobley at fourth overall, Barnes broke the expected draft order, as most had mocked Cunningham, Mobley, Jalen Green and Jalen Suggs to go in the Top 4 . With Kyle Lowry rumored to be on his way elsewhere by draft time, Suggs looked like the obvious selection for Toronto. The Raptors, it seems, knew what they were doing. Barnes has been nothing short of a revelation for Toronto, coming in and displaying a far more aggressive offensive game, than what was expected from him . The 6'9 combo forward is taking 14 shots a game and has created those looks himself. Barnes is unassisted on a whopping 81.8% of his made field goals, which stands in incredible contrast to his modest ways at Florida State, where he was seen more as an opportunistic scorer than someone who could consistently create his own shot at the NBA level. Barnes is clearly comfortable with the ball in his hands, and seems to have made it a priority to protect the ball after his six turnovers in his debut against the Wizards. In the two games since, spanning over 65 minutes played, he's turned the ball over just once. This further speaks to Barnes as a thinker. He identifies areas where he isn't in control and corrects himself for future games. As it stands, Barnes appears to be the sort of player who will maximize every ounce of his potential. Chris Duarte - Guard, Indiana Pacers The numbers: 39.7 minutes, 20.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 steals, 3.7 made three-pointers, 54.9 TS% Duarte has been the league's biggest rookie surprise so far. The 24-year-old was indeed expected to be an instant contributor due to his advanced age, and thus maturity, but no one saw the 13th overall pick coming out the gates like this. The 6'6 wing has clearly received the green light from new head coach Rick Carlisle, averaging 17.3 shot attempts per game, which ranks second on the Pacers . The rookie is attempting eight three-pointers per night, and has so far hit a mesmerizing 45.8% of them. Similarly to Barnes, Duarte has created most of his offense, having been assisted on just 47.6% of his made shots. Duarte's offensive game can only be described as smooth. So far in the young season, the Dominican has hit step-back three-pointers, fade-aways in the mid-range, and push shots in the paint. He's fully capable of both dribbling his way into shots, just as he's ready to be the kick-out option. While the rookie does have a tendency to struggle from within the three-point line (he's shooting 35.7% on 28 attempted two-pointers), it doesn’t necessarily point to long-term issue. The shot mechanics are fine, and he has great control of the ball suggesting those numbers will bounce back at some point soon. Rookie Notes Jalen Green & Alperen Sengun (Houston Rockets) Drafted second overall, Green has overtaken Cunningham as the new Rookie Of the Year favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook . He'll have an uphill battle if he has any aspirations to win the award, however. The 19-year-old is currently averaging 9.0 points and shooting just 32% from the field. As for Sengun, the 6'9 big has been productive in limited action, netting 8.5 points and 5.0 rebounds per game in just 18 minutes. However, while Sengun is whipping the ball around to teammates all over the court, he's also turning it over 4.5 times per game, while picking up four fouls in that same amount of minutes. The 19-year-old will need time to create a better balance for himself while he’s out there, but his offensive production is worth noting. Franz Wagner & Jalen Suggs (Orlando Magic) The two rookies came in with vastly different expectations. Suggs was expected to come in and immediate be a wildly explosive lead-guard who'd run the offense and put up huge numbers, while Wagner would be more opportunistic in his production. Instead, Wagner has had the better start, netting 14 points per game on a TS% of 66.7% after two games. Suggs, averaging 12 points per game, is shooting just 22.6% on his nightly 15.5 shot attempts, and has looked raw as a shot-maker. It's of course early, so there's ample time for the former Gonzaga guard to find his rhythm.",

    "full_description": "Although Social Security has been around for years, the program is constantly evolving. And now, workers and seniors alike should prepare for a number of changes that are set to take place in 2022. Here are a few specific ones that may impact you. 1. The average monthly benefit is rising Right now, the average senior on Social Security collects a monthly benefit of $1,565. Next year, the average monthly benefit is expected to rise to $1,657 once a 5.9% cost-of-living adjustment is implemented. To be clear, that's the largest raise seniors have seen in years, and it could help many beneficiaries better manage their living costs. That said, there's one variable that could come into play, and it's the cost of Medicare Part B premiums. Right now, the standard monthly Part B premium is $148.50 (though higher earners pay more). If that number rises substantially in 2022, it will eat into that higher benefit, since those premium costs are deducted from Social Security payments directly. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Work credits will be harder to earn To qualify for Social Security in retirement, you need to earn enough work credits in your lifetime. The value of a work credit can change from year to year. Right now, it's $1,470. In 2022, it will be increasing to $1,510. What this means is that you'll need to earn more money next year to set yourself up for future benefits. The maximum number of work credits you can earn in a single year is four. If you work full-time, this change most likely will not affect you at all. Even at today's minimum wage, working 40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year will allow you to snag four credits in 2022. But if you work part-time, you may need to put in more hours if your goal is to accumulate four work credits for 2022. 3. More wages will be taxed for Social Security purposes Higher earners don't necessarily pay taxes on all of their Social Security income. Each year, there's a wage cap that's put into place, and earnings beyond that threshold aren't subject to Social Security taxes. In 2021, wages above $142,800 are exempt from those taxes. But in 2022, the wage cap is rising to $147,000. This means that higher earners who are salaried employees could end up paying an additional $260.40 in Social Security taxes next year. That's because the current tax rate for Social Security is 12.4%, and for salaried workers, that tax is split evenly with their employers. If you're self-employed, though, you'll have to cover your entire Social Security tax bill yourself. And if you earn $147,000 or more, your Social Security tax burden will increase by $520.80 next year. Whether you're collecting Social Security already, you expect to file shortly, or you're not planning to sign up for benefits for many years, it pays to stay informed about the program's changes. It's possible that one or more of these updates will impact you or someone you care about in the new year.",

Champagne sales are on course to reach a four-year high this year, thanks to exports to the United States and Australia, French champagne wine growers lobby SGV said earlier this month.

    "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Although he's a rookie, Ju Ji-hoon's character helps save a life on his first rescue mission. Studio Dragon Ju Ji-hoon plays Kang Hyun-jo, a rookie park ranger in the Korean drama Jirisan . Hyun-jo has a secret and it’s one that helps him execute rescue missions others might abandon. Minutes after arriving at his new assignment, he’s sent on a dangerous mission that demonstrates his unusual abilities. “Hyun-jo probably isn’t someone who dreamed of becoming a ranger since he was little,” said Ju. “He is an army captain who graduated from the Korea Military Academy, but he quits his stable job and becomes a mountain ranger in Jirisan of all places. He definitely has his reasons, but I’ll stop here because I don’t want to spoil it for you.” The drama was filmed in Jirisan National Park, one of South Korea’s largest parks. The scenic 182 square mile park is thickly flowered with azaleas in the spring and known for its colorful fall foliage. It’s also home to several temples and attracts millions of visitors every year. While the drama hints at a supernatural presence, Ju says that it’s the park’s natural elements that really inspire awe. “If you go to Jirisan, you’ll see how big it is,” said Ju. “You become overwhelmed by Mother Nature. It’s eerie, but at times it also feels spiritual.” Ju had to increase his stamina in preparation for his role in the drama. Studio Dragon Writer Kim Eun-hee played a big part in Ju’s decision to star in the drama. Before creating the script for Jirisan , Kim wrote the time-travel detective story Signal and the historical zombie series Kingdom . Ju played a Joseon-era prince in two seasons of Kingdom and it only increased his admiration for the writer’s work.

I create the character in the process of meeting them and talking to them. I did the same for Kingdom . I think I met with Ms. Kim Eun-hee to the point where she became annoyed with me.” During their talks Kim would tell the actor other stories she was working on. “I was always amazed how she could think up such stories,” he said. “She always has a new story to tell. So every time I work with her, I look forward to the story she will be telling. Of course her scripts aren’t easy for actors to work with, but I was drawn to the interesting story. I believe that was why I was able to be on both seasons of Kingdom and Jirisan . It was an honor.” Ju found it interesting to learn more about what park rangers do. They perform many tasks the public might not be aware of. “Ms. Kim Eun-hee did so much research on rangers for the script, so she told me a lot about them,” said Ju. “The script also described the kind of tasks they were in charge of, but when I got to indirectly observe them working while on the set I learned that they are in charge of many different tasks and how important they are. Each ranger is assigned a different task, but some of them include caring for the safety of hikers, finding and rescuing the distressed, identifying, observing, and recording animal and plant life, and checking up on the facilities that require maintenance. Rangers protect the mountains, animals, plants and people.” Although Ju enjoys hiking in his free time, filming the drama’s arduous scenes required training. “I had to exercise a lot to improve my physical strength,” said Ju. “It was hard to film in the mountains because the ground wasn’t flat. Just standing alone made me very tired. Scenes where I climb the mountain, hike in heavy rain, and fall over were all required for the shoot. You can only do these things when you’re physically strong. So, I increased my stamina by riding my favorite bicycle across Jirisan and by taking a lot of walks around Jirisan.” The drama’s cast includes Jun Ji-hyun aka Gianna Jun, Sung Dong-il and Oh Jung-se. Working with these gifted actors was a rewarding and positive experience. “I've been a fan of Ms. Jun Ji-hyun’s since I was young, so I still remember the first time I met her for Jirisan . It was an amazing experience to be working with someone who I’ve been a fan of even before my debut.” Jun plays an experienced, although sometimes reckless, ranger that Hyun-jo must follow around. At first she warns him to keep up, but soon realizes he might be useful. Sung Dong-il and Oh Jung-se also play fellow rangers. “Mr. Sung Dong-il made a special appearance in the movie Along with the Gods ,” said Ju. “So I had met him briefly then, but now I got the chance to work with him for a longer period. It was my first time working with Mr. Oh Jung-se. I have been seeing them on the big screen long before I started acting, so it was great to be working on the same project with them. All of them are experienced actors, so the atmosphere on the film set just couldn’t have been bad. It was very friendly.” Jirisan is streaming at a time when there is new and heightened interest in Korean drama, thanks to the popularity of the Netflix NFLX drama Squid Game . That drama’s popularity only adds to the interest in Korean media generated by Bong Joon-ho’s film Parasite winning an Oscar and the k-pop group BTS topping the charts. Ju says he is thrilled by this development and looks forward to what it may offer in the future. “Until now, most investments and production budgets were planned with just the Korean and the Asian box office in mind,” he said. “The better Korean media content becomes, the more interest it will attract from abroad. With more co-production and investment opportunities, we will be able to create better and more wonderful works. The quality of the project does not rely solely on its budget, but I’m looking forward to the possibility of producing greater works with improved quality in a better environment with a larger budget.” Ju, who also appeared in the TV dramas Hyena and Mask , as well as both Along With The Gods films, will next appear in Gentleman , an action crime film, and hopefully another season of Kingdom . “You will be able to see it in theaters and on OTT platforms next year. Many people are waiting for the next season of Kingdom and all of us actors are also very much looking forward to it. Although the production of an additional season has not been decided yet, there are many more stories to be told. I am also hoping that it will be made.” Jirisan, an iQiyi Original Drama, was produced by Studio Dragon.",

However, Squarespace appears to have a much better gross margin than Wix. Does that mean Squarespace's business is just structured better? Not necessarily. In this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass , recorded on Oct. 8 , Fool contributor Jason Hall discusses this issue with Millionacres editor Deidre Woollard. Jason points out that Wix has a strong international presence, requiring a bigger workforce. And this may be something that actually weighs on Squarespace's margins if it picks up more business in international markets over time. Jason Hall: There's one thing that you noticed earlier, Jon, when we were doing our prep for the show is that the difference in gross margins between the two businesses. It's tough right now because with Squarespace having just gone public recently, we only have a quarter that's publicly reported. Who knows exactly what that looks like. It's also a period where some of Wix's expenses have been a little bit wonky. They've gone up a lot over the past year so you look at their trailing numbers. Their operating margins have come down. But both businesses generate positive operating cash and positive free cash flows. There's interesting things there. My question, Deidre, I'm going to just pose this to you, it does seem that Squarespace does tend to have higher gross margins. Because where Wix's gross margins are, are about where they've been for the past five years. They're in that 60-ish percentage range. But Wix is also a company that has a lot more feet on the ground. It's a more people-based business. Their president talked about the fact that they don't know exactly what the future is going to look like. But when it comes to them as a hybrid office model or a remote office model, they want their people together as much as physically possible. I think they are really a very people-centered business. The question is, from an economic model, is Squarespace just built to be more profitable? Deidre Woollard: I would say yes now. We talked about international expansion. I think if Squarespace wants to be really successful in international expansion, they're going to have to put more boots on the ground in different places. They're going to have to expand that way. It doesn't make sense not to do that. Talking about acquisitions, too, I think they know that in order to really compete as a public company, they're going to have to spend more money than they have in the past. I think they are trying to get comfortable with that. You've got people who have been with the company for a long time. They have been used to running it lean, they also know that the rules have changed now, they're a quarter into this. I think that that may shift over time.",

[+] Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Quaker State 400 presented by Walmart on July 14th, 2018, at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, Kentucky. (Photo by Adam Lacy/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Icon Sportswire via Getty Images When it comes to measuring the health of the sport of NASCAR in recent years much of the attention is focused on the top-tier Cup series. It’s there that full season primary sponsorships, once a rarity in the post-recession era after 2008, have started to make a comeback. And with the anticipation building for the Cup series Next Gen car, as well as the sports efforts with diversity and inclusion, new sponsors have emerged along with big names from outside the sport . All are indicators that perhaps the sport is as healthy as it’s been in quite some time. While much of the sponsorship attention is focused on the top-tier Cup series the lower series are showing signs that they are healthy as well. Recently Richard Childress Racing held a sponsorship announcement for driver Sheldon Creed who will drive for the team in the NASCAR Xfinity series fulltime in 2022. The sponsor is one that should be very familiar to fans, one that has been in the sport for many years. Yet the branding for this longtime sponsor isn’t something that gets all the attention; instead, it’s a rare case where that sponsor’s actual product is seen just about everywhere at a NASCAR track. Whelen Engineering specializes in lighting. Not just any lighting but warning lights, sirens, and scene illumination for first responders. As the “official lighting of NASCAR’ whenever the field goes green for a race, or there’s a caution, most of the green and yellow lights seen around the track and flashing atop the vehicles in the infield were made by Whelen Engineering. Whelen is also the entitlement sponsor for NASCAR’s modified, All-American and Euro grass roots series. Now they will return for a full Xfinity season sponsorship. The company has inked full Xfinity season sponsorships in the past with drivers such as Steve Park, Dave Blaney, and Kenny Wallace in the 1980s and 90s.

In 2022, however, they will return as the full season sponsor for Creed at RCR. “The opportunity was there,” said Peter Tiezzi, III, general manager of motorsports and project manager for Whelen. “It was a good time to come back to RCR. They approached us, and we couldn't pass it up. He's a great driver and where he's going to go next season. It's just made sense to us.” Unlike the Cup series, the Xfinity series won’t be debuting a Next Gen car in 2022 so that didn’t play into Whelen’s decision. Instead, the announcement of the RCR sponsorship for next season could be an indication that like the Cup series, the Xfinity series is doing just fine. It also demonstrates that the overall motorsports sponsorship landscape is improving. Whelen has been involved in other forms of motorsports, notably the IMSA series where it’s been a primary sponsor for Action Express Racing which fields Cadillacs since 2015. They recently extended that partnership and Action Express firmed up their driver lineup for 2022. “I think it looks really well,” Tiezzi said of the sponsorship landscape. “I mean, we’ve sponsored different series outside of NASCAR as well, and use it as an opportunity to bring our customers to races and make them aware of racing.” Sheldon Creed will move to NASCAR's Xfinity series fulltime in 2022 with Richard Childress Racing. Richard Childress Racing For driver Sheldon Creed, who made his way into NASCAR in years after the post-recession era, full season sponsorships are something new to him. “It’s the first time in my career we’ve had something like this,” Creed said. “Obviously I’ve had sponsors all the way up, but to have something signed this early and to have a sponsor is really great not just myself, but for my whole team.” Fans will see the red and white Chevy emblazoned with Whelen all of next season in the Xfinity series racing on track. It will be the most visible part of a sponsorship that has been somewhat in the background for many years in NASCAR. “I tell people,” Tiezzi said with a smile. “If you shut all lights off for the weekend at a racetrack, you will have no control over what's going on.” Come next season those lights will be shining brightly on a new sponsorship in a sign that the sport of NASCAR is well beyond its post-recession era and sponsors are eager to jump back on board. “We’ve been around motorsports for three decades,” Tiezzi said. “We just want to be more visible than we ever have.”",

Next up, the homegrown UV specialist appears to be working on bringing in a new avatar of one of its most popular nameplates, the Scorpio as it has been spotted on test many times already. The Mahindra Scorpio has been in the business for nearly two decades and the upcoming model is subjected to a whole host of changes inside and out. In the latest set of spy pictures of the production-spec prototype, the design revisions can be clearly seen as the Mahindra Scorpio has undergone evolutionary updates to its visual elements. The 2022 Mahindra Scorpio gets a redesigned headlamp cluster with a double-barrel unit placed in a pair of U-shaped elements with integrated horizontal LED Daytime Running Lights on top flanking the new grille section having vertical slats. The restyled bumper comprises C-shaped LED lighting element surrounding the fog lamps with a wider central intake and a new skid plate. The signature tall pillars and upright elements along with a slightly raked front windshield, sturdy bonnet structure, and rectangular wing mirrors are other highlights. The rear gains updated LED tail lamps with changes to the bumper and the new-gen Scorpio will likely become the second Mahindra model to wear the new Twin Peaks logo. The interior boasts a brand new dashboard, steering wheel, instrument cluster and centre console with improvements to the surface finishes. We do expect the 2022 Mahindra Scorpio to get an improved features list with a large touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, in-car connectivity based features, cruise control, push-button start/stop, etc. As for the performance, the 2.2-litre mHawk four-cylinder diesel and the 2.0-litre mStallion four-cylinder petrol from the XUV700 could be utilised. The powertrains could be linked with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed torque converter automatic transmission with an all-wheel-drive configuration in the top-end variant.

    "full_description": "Six years ago, a ruptured oil pipeline in Santa Barbara County sent 140,000 gallons of crude oil gushing onto the sands of Refugio State Beach. The company that owned the pipeline survived the onslaught of lost revenue and lawsuits that followed, but the offshore producer that used the line to transport its oil did not. After twice seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Venoco Inc., eventually walked away from its drilling operation in Southern California, leaving the state to deal with millions of dollars in costs to close down the inactive wells. This month’s spill off the shore of Orange County, which dumped an estimated 25,000 gallons into the ocean, could become an expensive repeat of the Refugio spill, some experts say. The firm that operates the San Pedro Bay pipeline is facing intense pressure from federal regulators as well as businesses and residents suing over the effects of the spill. Filing for bankruptcy protection, as Venoco did , could become an attractive option for the pipeline’s parent company, granting it temporary reprieve from financial and legal duress. But it’s too early to tell if Amplify Energy Corp. will take that step. Its oil production is less dependent on California than Venoco, but it’s also a relatively small player in an industry in which the financial blow from an environmental disaster can be devastating. “They can easily throw their hands up and declare bankruptcy,” said longtime energy markets analyst and advisor Stephen Schork. Amplify Energy and its subsidiaries are not considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy “at this time,” focusing instead on environmental cleanup and working with regulatory agencies investigating the spill, said Amy Conway, a company spokeswoman. California Full coverage: What to know about the Huntington Beach oil spill A major oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach, Calif., washed up on nearby Orange County beaches, killing fish and birds and threatening local wetlands. As U.S. oil production has declined, larger energy companies have shifted their attention to deep-water drilling, where vast reserves — and profits — remain untapped. The firms have sold off their aging, shallow-water platforms and pipelines to smaller players, which have struggled as the price of oil dropped. The threat of Chapter 11 bankruptcies among those companies surged during the pandemic. Whether Amplify Energy eventually decides to seek bankruptcy protection depends on several factors, including the terms of the company’s insurance coverage and whether the shipping company operating the vessel that may have originally damaged the pipeline with its anchor is identified and held liable. Investigators plan to cut apart the San Pedro Bay pipeline and transport the ruptured section to a lab for analysis, crippling the company’s California drilling operations. How long the pipeline remains shut down will be another significant factor for the firm, which draws about 14% of its total energy production from offshore operations in California, according to recent financial filings. In the wake of the Santa Barbara spill, Venoco went out of business after the state refused to turn the pipeline back on, shutting off half the offshore company’s revenue. The state also refused to allow the company to use tankers to transport oil to shore. Richard Carson, an economics professor at UC San Diego, was one of the principal economic investigators for the damage assessments after the Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez spills. Contrary to some observers, he said that if the federal government finds that Amplify Energy was ultimately the responsible party, he doesn’t believe the company will be able to avoid financial responsibility for the spill by declaring bankruptcy or deflecting liability to subsidiaries. “It would be really hard to have a federal oil lease off the coast of California and have set this thing up in such a way to deny the state and feds restitution making the public whole,” Carson said. Amplify Energy said this month in a public notice that ran in several local newspapers that the firm may be liable for spill cleanup costs and damages. The notice, required by the 1990 federal Oil Pollution Act, says claims that may be reimbursed include damage to natural resources, damage to or loss of personal property, and loss of profits and earnings capacity. Claims that are denied or not settled within three months can be sent to the National Pollution Funds Center for payment from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, the company said in the notice. The fund, administered by the Coast Guard, is funded through a per-barrel tax on crude oil. Federal law requires that oil companies keep $35 million available for oil spills of this size. Since 2016, U.S. regulators have sought to tighten liability and decommissioning rules for offshore drillers, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the majority of U.S. offshore drilling occurs, fearing that taxpayers would be forced to pay to close down unused oil platforms if more small players folded under financial pressure, said Tyler Priest, a University of Iowa associate professor who studies the history of oil and gas drilling. But that attempt to increase bonding and insurance requirements, first proposed under the Obama administration, met heavy pushback from the industry. The rule was “nixed” under the Trump administration, said Priest, and remains unfinished despite forward momentum under the Biden administration. It’s unclear how much insurance Amplify Energy carried at the time of the spill, but experts say it’s unlikely that the policies could pay for every claim. The number of lawsuits piling up “may be a significant driver” of a potential bankruptcy, said Lexi Hazam, a San Francisco lawyer representing a group of plaintiffs that includes commercial fishers and a whale-watching company. The number of legal complaints has already reached double digits, including those filed by Laguna Beach coastal property owners, a Huntington Beach surf school, a Seal Beach bait and tackle store, and several groups of fishing and seafood sales companies. If Amplify Energy were to file for bankruptcy, there’s a good chance that plaintiffs wouldn’t see as much compensation as they hoped, experts say. Bankruptcy judges set the amount of potential damages that can be paid out by companies in Chapter 11, and even the federal government can’t force a company to cough up more than that amount, said Eric Smith, a business professor at Tulane University and associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute. “You can bankrupt the company but there’s very little you can do to be completely reimbursed,” Smith said. A potential bankruptcy wouldn’t spell the end of litigation, Hazam said, but it would result in “a different kind of process, and obviously, it involves a limit on the amounts that can be recovered.” How much Amplify Energy ends up paying could also depend on how successfully the company isolated the risk of oil spills into its subsidiaries, a complicated web of limited liability companies and corporations. An Amplify Energy subsidiary, Beta Operating Co., operates the oil rigs off the Orange County coast. Another, the San Pedro Bay Pipeline Co., is responsible for the pipeline that burst. If the smaller outfits were deemed solely responsible for the spill and prosecutors and claimants could not connect blame for the pipeline spill back to Amplify Energy, then the company could cut the subsidiaries loose, allow them to fail and avoid a direct financial hit to its core business, some experts say. “You can toss your subsidiary to the wolves,” said Ted Borrego, an oil and gas lawyer with five decades’ experience in the industry and adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law Center. Amplify Energy is a relatively small firm with a balance sheet that pales in comparison to big international oil corporations. Its leadership has pursued a corporate strategy in recent years that left the company with little cash on hand when the spill took place. A Times review of years’ worth of Amplify Energy’s financials reveals that the company’s leaders have long emphasized slashing costs, rebuying stock and paying millions of dollars in dividends to shareholders over maintaining a substantial cash reserve. Amplify Energy itself arose from bankruptcy. Its corporate predecessor restructured four years ago , clearing $1.3 billion in debt. The new firm emerged leaner, with comparatively little cash on hand. When the pandemic hit and oil prices dipped, Amplify Energy said it slashed costs 37%. A subsidiary also received a $5.5-million Paycheck Protection Program loan, later forgiven , to cover payroll costs for 292 employees. In July, Amplify Energy had $235 million in debt and $21 million in cash on hand, far less than the anticipated cost of the cleanup and any legal damages. Like the Santa Barbara spill, which is still being litigated, the Orange County disaster will be in court for years to come — and likely continue to incur costs in the interim.",

The company has recently been experiencing a bit of a slowdown in customers and in spending on its platform as economies are reopening. Investors are wondering whether this latest report will shed some light on how it's affecting the company and what management has to say about the situation. Management has already said it is working on a few strategies to increase revenue and profit despite the slowdown. This next report should offer some hints of management's execution of those strategies and the effects of reopening economies on the bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. eBay is making more out of less eBay makes the vast majority of its revenue by taking a percentage of the sales transactions -- also called gross merchandise volume (GMV) -- on its platform. In eBay's second quarter (ended June 30), GMV decreased by 12% to $22.1 billion from the same quarter last year. Keep in mind that last year's figures were inflated due to the surge in customer activity at the pandemic onset. Still, despite the decrease in spending on eBay, the company increased revenue. eBay did this by increasing the percentage of revenue (take rate) it keeps from transactions. The take rate in Q2 2021 was up by more than 200 basis points to 11.3% from 9.2% in the same quarter in 2020. That increase boosted revenue to $2.7 billion, up from $2.3 billion the year prior. It will be interesting to see if eBay can keep revenue elevated while it sheds some of the consumers who joined at the pandemic onset. From the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter, eBay lost 7 million active buyers. That was a meaningful part of its 166 million total before the loss. The company now boasts 159 million active buyers, but management highlights that these are higher-quality buyers. eBay has reduced promotional activities that attracted buyers who only spent during promotional periods. Instead, management has shifted its focus to buyers who shop more often and spend more each time they shop. Wall Street is optimistic about eBay's third quarter Analysts on Wall Street expect eBay to report revenue of $2.46 billion and earnings per share of $0.89 for the third quarter. If the company hits those estimates, it would be a decrease of 5.8% and an increase of 4.7%, respectively, from last year. Estimates on Wall Street are on the higher end of the range that management guided for the third quarter. On the revenue side, management estimates revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion for Q3. And for earnings per share, management has guided in the range of $0.86 and $0.90 for the third quarter. eBay's stock price was already up 40.5% year to date as of Oct. 6. Therefore, if the company fails to meet expectations, the stock price could fall as a result. Still, it's trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 17.3. If there is a pullback in the share price following the report, it could be an opportunity for long-term investors to start adding eBay stock to their portfolio .",

In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Demitri Kalogeropoulos, Brian Withers, and Neil Patel tell us why they decided to buy shares of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF ( NYSEMKT:VTI ) , Square ( NYSE:SQ ) , and Lemonade ( NYSE:LMND ) . Demitri Kalogeropoulos: I recently bought VTI, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, ETF. It's what I do. I just do that. I have it scheduled on the first and the 15th of the month, I put extra cash into that. Basically, that's where most of my cash goes in. It's a total stock market fund. I told you I own a lot of individual stocks, but new money in the market, I want to keep it steady flow into that, and I love index funds, I love passively managed index funds that have small, almost zero fees because we know that even a small fee, I was talking to a friend recently and he started to talk to me about his great two and a half percent index fee on his manager charges in for it and I was like, that is massive, if you extend that out 20 years is so much money. Brian Withers: It's almost Jason's mortgage. [laughs] Kalogeropoulos: That's big. Withers: That's crazy. Jason Hall: Yeah, you can even live in your financial advisor's office. Neil Patel: I know. Exactly. Kalogeropoulos: I think Vanguard's expense rate was 0.03, that's what this. Hall: Yeah, three basis points Kalogeropoulos: Yeah. You're going to match the market, which is something that almost all professional Wall Street and people are not able to achieve and you're going to do it with zero costs, so if you don't know where to put your money, that's a great place to just put it for now. Patel: Now, I'll just brief here. A company I'm looking at and I'm late to the party is Square and this is one that- Hall: It's going to be a long party, bro. Patel: Demitri talked about it and it's a company that looks expensive, but over the long term, technically, it's cheap if it continues outperforming. I'm just completely interested in enamored with platform businesses and the network effects and the optionality, and the fact that there's still international growth potential and the Afterpay acquisition. Everything you could think of. The fact that they get customers and then they sell them new features, new products, switching costs are high for their users, all of the above. I'm super bullish on digital payments and Square in particular. Withers: For me, I bought a stock just about a month ago, I bought a little more Lemonade. Just so that you know, it was about a half a percent position and right now, Lemonade is about, the cost basis is almost three percent of my overall portfolio and it's one of two stocks that are actually down in my portfolio right now. But I like Lemonade for the long term, and I just wanted to put a little money there.",

In that light, such a big sell-off seems wildly overdone, and could open up an opportunity for Foolish long-term investors. Image source: Getty Images. PagSeguro is a leading brand with a long growth runway PagSeguro was founded in 2006 under the umbrella of Brazilian internet company UOL , and became an independently traded company via its 2018 IPO . The company touts its comprehensive digital finance business across merchant acquiring, digital banking, point-of-sale devices, free digital banking accounts, and other banking services. Its mission is to \"disrupt and democratize financial services in Brazil, a concentrated, underpenetrated, and high-interest-rate market, by providing an end-to-end digital banking ecosystem that is safe, affordable, simple and mobile-first for both merchants and consumers.\" You can think of PagSeguro kind of like the Square ( NYSE:SQ ) of Brazil. The company offered online payment processing services and point-of-sale systems to small and micro merchants that had long operated on a cash-only basis. PagSeguro then began offering a free digital bank account for its merchants, through which it provides other services, such an early payment on merchant receivables (Installment payment plans are common among consumers in Brazil). PagSeguro expanded its digital bank to consumers with the launch of PagBank in 2019, where it makes money on wire transfers, interchange fees, credit cards, P2P transactions, loans, and other services – not unlike Square moving from merchant POS systems to its consumer-facing Cash App. It's the prepaid cards from PagBank that are likely to be affected by the new interchange fee limit. How bad is the impact of the interchange rule? Perhaps not at all While some financial analysts estimated PagSeguro's 2022 revenue might be affected by low to mid-single digits and adjusted EBITDA in the low teens by the new rule, a recent press release from management had its own more positive take. Based on several scenarios, management now expects a negligible effect on 2022 net revenue and net income, and actually expects a slight benefit from the rule in 2023 and beyond. How could that be? It's because that while PagSeguro makes revenue from prepaid interchange fees linked to its consumer bank accounts, the merchant acquiring business actually pays interchange fees as a cost of goods sold. Therefore, the larger acquiring business will become more profitable if interchange fees go down. \"The fact that PAGS has complementary payments businesses (acquiring and cards issuance) creates a natural hedge for the company,\" the press release said. Meanwhile, the business has a long runway Assuming this rule change doesn't affect PagSeguro's growth prospects, its discounted stock price could be a great opportunity. That's because Brazil's banking system is still highly concentrated among legacy institutions, there is a significant amount of unbanked people in the country, and many still use cash for transactions -- even e-commerce transactions. In 2017, the top five banking institutions in Brazil held 83.4% of financial assets. As recently as 2017, 65% of bill payments were still made in cash in Brazil. And as recently as 2019, 57% of Brazilians had not even heard of digital banking. As more Brazilians adopt digital banking services, move away from cash, and if PagSeguro can offer a more customer-friendly solution than legacy banks, the opportunity remains quite large. Management just pre-released preliminary Q3 results, showing consolidated total payment volume up 85% year over year, with the acquiring business unaffected by these regulations up 49%. Importantly, PagBank users grew by one million to 12.2 million active users, nearly 9% quarter-over-quarter growth. With the stock's recent sell-off, it now trades at just 27 times next year's average earnings estimate. For a company growing that fast, that's a pretty undemanding valuation. While the regulatory overhang and inflation fears in Brazil may put a damper on near-term sentiment, remember that PagSeguro makes most of its money as a percentage of transaction costs, so much of its revenue should grow along with any problematic inflation. Given that the recent interchange fee fears aren't as bad as first thought, PagSeguro's recent sell-off looks like a solid opportunity in this emerging-markets growth stock .",

Put simply, the company empowers creators to start their journeys and then profits only as these creators succeed. It costs Unity little to do this but allows it to capture the upside. In this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass , recorded on Oct. 11 , Fool contributors Jon Quast and Jose Najarro along with analyst Sanmeet Deo go into more detail explaining how this business model works in Unity's favor. Jon Quast: This is a company that I don't know much about and I've been looking forward to somebody like you breaking it down like that. I very much appreciate that. One thing that I wanted to point out, I did do a little bit of homework before we came on the show today, and I just wanted to point out, you pointed out the different revenue segments there for Unity. And the operate segment, so that's once a game or whatever it may be has been launched, they're providing that service to those developers on an ongoing basis from there, that's actually the biggest part of the business in the second quarter of 2021. I just did the math on it, 67% almost of their revenue was from the operate segment. What I also thought was very interesting was that the operate solutions, according to the S-1, they generate revenue primarily through usage-based models. Whereas the creative segment of the business is a subscription, the operate segment is a usage-based model, which I find very interesting when you think about it from a potential upside perspective. We've talked on the show before about how mobile gaming is the only part of the video game industry that's actually growing. So by being a usage-based model, Unity is empowering these game developers, and once one of these becomes a hit, that's just pure upside for Unity. They're not capped by the set subscription that they on-boarded them with, they can onboard many, many game developers and potentially benefit from any of those that wind up being a runaway mobile game hit. I just thought that was an interesting aspect. I don't know if that's the correct take or not. That was my take on it. Jose Najarro: Definitely, Jon, and I think that's one thing the CEO mentioned. It creates this one, that both the designer, both the creator of the game and Unity have the same goal. If their game does well, Unity is going to benefit and so is the game developer. That's what pushes Unity to, \"Hey, make sure we have the best products for you, make sure that we're able to provide the best services for your customers, because if your game does well, then we're going to do well, you're going to come back you're going to make another hit game, that hit game is going to do well and we're going to see that kind of growth.\" That's a great point you made there, Jon. Sanmeet Deo: Unity is definitely one that I've looked at and I really like as well. It's one that I own personally myself, from one I've been following along. One of the things that I'm really excited about with this business is the optionality in terms of, right now it's primarily a gaming engine and it's making most of its money and business off of mobile gaming and the creative solutions and also what Jon was saying was, the usage-based model, which gives them so much upside as they grow. But they're breaking into these other verticals of architecture, automotive, film. I like to liken Unity as it's almost the software, the operating system for AR, VR, and the metaverse. It's anything you want to create in terms of those things. Right now it's almost a duopoly between Unity and Unreal. For people that may not know, Unreal Engine is made by Epic Games, which is the creator of Fortnite . One thing that I came across with my research in terms of the competition...that advantage of Unity is that it's low code and it's easy to learn and it's used a lot in the smaller, the mobile games, while Unreal, it's a little more challenging to learn, it's a little more complicated. It's also been used for a lot of what they call the AAA game titles, which are the big game titles that we think of. The interesting thing about Unity is they offer their software subscription plan for free for anyone less than $100,000 in revenue, so students and young people or young creators, or developers are looking to learn off software like Udemy where you can learn how to use it and then you can just get the software yourself and start creating. Unity really wants to capture that developer from the time they get interested and start, to the time that they might actually potentially become their own developer or developer team or create their own developer business. It's very content economy-focused and empowering the content, or I should say more in this sense, the developer community, empowering them to learn their software, to use their software, to expand with their software, and they both expand together. Very interesting there in terms of how it's structured versus Unreal and how its strategy differs a little bit about it. This is a huge market. I think Dave said that it's about a $29 billion TAM [total addressable market] and growing. Like we've said, mobile gaming is the fastest-growing segment of gaming. One thing I like about this company too is as we've been talking a lot about, again, I keep saying the convergence of movies and gaming and all of the stuff. It's all going to come together, what are you going to use to make it come together? Something like Unity, it's like the operating system for all of those things. I don't know if you guys know too that Zuckerberg, of Facebook fame, [laughs] wanted to buy Unity in, I think it was 2015. Because he saw it as a key platform or core technology for the metaverse. He actually wrote a memo that has recently been available of why he wanted to buy Unity, and where it's going. If I can find that I'll definitely pass it along. But it says a lot when Mark Zuckerberg was interested in buying you and now given the fact that Facebook is watching their own metaverse initiative and focus. It's a definitely exciting company. Thank you for presenting that. Any other questions on Unity or? Quast: I just wanted to underscore something that you just said Sanmeet, and that is how they onboard new developers. There's no charge under a certain amount of revenue. This is a company with 79% gross margins. I talked about on The Rank earlier today that optionality is best when the greater the asymmetries. What I mean by that is when there's little downside to do something, but great potential upside, that's an asymmetry of optionality that is investors' favors. With 79% gross margins, this is a low-cost thing to offer this to somebody. But since it is a usage-based model, the asymmetry to the upside is very much in investors' favor. I really like that about the business model.",

The general rule is that if you claim benefits early, you'll get less money each month while if you delay the start of your checks you'll bigger ones. But that doesn't mean an early claim always translates to collecting less Social Security benefits over your lifetime, nor is the reverse true. If your hope is to get the most money from Social Security over time, there are three key ways that you can do that. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Calculate your break-even point For most people, it doesn't just make sense to focus on maximizing their monthly income -- it's smarter to look at the big picture and see how to get the most lifetime benefits. And to do that, you'll want to calculate your break-even point. See, retirees receive their standard benefit amount only by claiming it at full retirement age. They'll get a reduced benefit if they claim early and an increased benefit until age 70 if they wait to file. Of course, waiting means missing entire checks in exchange for getting more money later. You'll want to calculate how long it will take to break even for these higher checks if you're considering a delay. Here's how: Estimate how much your monthly payment would be at the claiming ages you're considering . You can do this by signing into your Social Security account , which provides an estimate of your benefits at different claiming ages. Or you can do the math yourself to see how your benefits would be affected based on the age you claim them. Determine how much income you'd miss by waiting until a later date to claim benefits. For example, if you were entitled to a $1,085 benefit at age 62 and are thinking about delaying until a full retirement age of 67, you'd miss five years of benefits or $65,100 in income. Calculate how much extra you'd get each month due to waiting. In the above example, your benefit at FRA would be $1,550 so you'd get $465 more per month if you put off filing until full retirement age. See how many months you'd have to receive the higher benefit to account for the missed income. This is your break-even point. If you miss $65,100 in benefits in exchange for $465 per month later, you'd need to receive that extra $465 for 140 months -- or 11.7 years. If you don't live at least that long, an early claim is preferred. If you live longer, a later claim is better. Calculating your break-even amount helps you assess the consequences of an early or late filing much more clearly than just looking at the monthly check amounts at each age. Doing this math is the first crucial step toward claiming the maximum in Social Security income. 2. Consider your life expectancy It's impossible to know exactly how long you are going to live. But you can make an educated guess. Your current health status, your family's history of longevity, and actuarial projections of your life expectancy can all help you to determine if you're likely to live past your break-even point. If you anticipate living well into your 80s or even into your 90s, a delayed claim for Social Security benefits is the best choice. But if you have serious health issues or family members tended to pass away young, the odds of getting more lifetime Social Security checks are higher if you don't wait. 3. Undo an ill-advised early claim Sometimes, retirees claim Social Security early and end up regretting it. If this happens to you, there are ways to undo the damage. If you just claimed your benefits within a year or less, you can withdraw your filing -- as long as you're willing and able to pay back any Social Security benefits you've already received. This would make it as though your claim never happened and you wouldn't be subject to the early filing penalties that otherwise would have applied. If you haven't hit full retirement age yet, you could also go back to work and earn enough that your benefits stop . When you reach full retirement age, your check amount will be recalculated and you'll be credited back the monthly early filing penalty for each month in which you didn't receive a benefit check. The bottom line is, if you want to get the most Social Security money, you can't assume a late claim is always the best approach. Yet if you've filed early and regret it, you don't necessarily need to accept your fate. Do the math to make sure you're choosing to file for Social Security at the best time. And if it turns out you made the wrong choice, explore your options for getting back on track.",

    "content": "The main organization representing participants in the Russian crypto space has lambasted authorities in Moscow for not doing enough to regulate the industry. The criticism comes four years after President Putin directed institutions to legally define the status of digital financial technologies. Regulators Accused of Failure to Take Russian Crypto Market Out of Shadow Russian regulatory bodies have been criticized for their actions regarding the cryptocurrency industry in the country. According to Yuri Pripachkin, head of the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain (Racib), their actions are still “half-hearted” and are not aimed at finding a systematic solution for Russia’s state policy in the field of digital assets. Speaking to the business news portal RBC, Pripachkin reminded about President Vladimir Putin’s order from Oct. 21, 2017, in which the Russian leader mandated the adoption of legislation tailored to define the legal status of digital technologies utilized in the financial sector by July 2018. The president of Racib, formerly known as the Russian Association of Crypto Industry and Blockchain, noted that since Putin issued the order, the crypto market capitalization has increased by 1,250%. Pripachkin further emphasized that “from the point of view of regulation of the crypto industry in the Russian Federation, according to its professional representatives, absolutely nothing has been done to bring out of the shadow the domestic segment of this market (accounting for more than 10% of the global one), with turnovers comparable to the annual federal budget revenues ($270 billion).” Cryptocurrency matters in Russia remain only partially regulated after the adoption of the law “On Digital Financial Assets” which went into force in January of this year. While it provides some regulatory clarity regarding these currencies, no rules have been introduced to govern their issuance and circulation in the country’s economy. Pripachkin pointed out that the term “smart contract” is nowhere to be found, neither in the already approved legislation, nor in the draft laws that are currently under consideration. Then there’s crypto mining, which although not prohibited in Russia, remains unregulated. The Racib official added that there has been no progress on any of the other instructions in Putin’s order and provided another example: Despite the establishment of a regulatory sandbox in 2018, due to the irreconcilable position of Bank of Russia towards cryptocurrencies, not a single public blockchain project submitted for testing has received approval from the country’s main financial regulator. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has remained stubbornly opposed to the legalization of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in Russia. The monetary authority views them as money surrogates that are banned under current Russian law. Earlier this year, the bank advised stock exchanges against listing financial instruments tied to crypto assets. This week, its governor Elvira Nabiullina said the CBR is not ready to allow the trading of bitcoin ETFs. In a situation determined by insufficient and opaque legislation, Russian crypto users find themselves forced to export an estimated 18 trillion ruble ($255 billion) worth of funds outside the Russian economy, Pripachkin remarked. That’s comparable to the total revenues of the Russian federal budget for the entire 2020, or around 20 trillion rubles, the head of Racib stated.

If you think a company has performed well in the quarter, it may also be good to purchase more of the stock prior to the release of earnings. Three Motley Fool contributors are watching the banking and payments fintech Square ( NYSE:SQ ) , the digital marketplace bank LendingClub ( NYSE:LC ) , and the web developer Wix.com ( NASDAQ:WIX ) . Here is why these stocks are important to watch this earnings season. Will Square deliver another blockbuster quarter? Keith Noonan (Square): Fintech services leader Square has been posting stellar growth, with revenue up 195% year over year across the first half of 2021. While it's unlikely that the company will continue to expand at such a rapid clip, the business's long-term outlook remains intriguing, and it will likely be a very influential player in fintech through the next decade. The company's Cash App mobile payment application and its payment-processing service for merchants have built impressive user bases, and growing adoption for these platforms and other tailwinds have helped the company post strong performance. The company has also been making some significant acquisitions, most recently announcing plans to purchase Afterpay -- a leader in the fast-growing buy now, pay later category. Image source: Getty Images. Square is set to publish its third-quarter earnings results after the market closes on Nov. 4, and it's fair to say that expectations are high. Square crushed earnings expectations in the second quarter, delivering an adjusted profit of $0.18 per share when the average analyst estimate had targeted adjusted per-share earnings of $0.05. The company's share price is now up 245% over the last three years. Some investors and analysts are concerned that slowing growth for Cash App will lead to stock sell-offs or limit potential upside in the near term. However, the company has multiple industry tailwinds at its back, and it could have some big moves in store. Notably, Bitcoin sales have been boosting the fintech leader's revenue. With the market-leading cryptocurrency enjoying strong momentum at the end of Q3 and recently going on to set new pricing highs, Square could deliver another earnings surprise with its next quarterly release. CEO Jack Dorsey also recently said on Twitter that Square was considering building an open-source Bitcoin mining system, and it's possible investors will get an update on these plans during the fintech company's third-quarter conference call. With a market capitalization of roughly $118 billion and shares trading at roughly 6.2 times expected sales and 136.5 times expected earnings, Square's Q3 results will be under the microscope, and the company's performance could have a ripple effect on valuations across the fintech space. A potentially huge catalyst for LendingClub Bram Berkowitz (LendingClub): The digital marketplace bank LendingClub is up roughly 266% year to date. But with just a $3.4 billion market cap, I believe shares are still way undervalued. It has been a somewhat long ride for the online personal lender, which got wrapped up in a scandal in 2016 and took several years to recover. At the start of this year, LendingClub closed on its acquisition of the branchless Radius Bank, which helped it streamline its lending operations by giving it a cheap deposit base to use for funding loans and saving on loan origination costs. Radius could also be useful down the road by providing other capabilities such as checking accounts. With Radius intact, management at LendingClub chose to change its model from selling all of its loans to investors to holding as many as a quarter of the loans it originates on its balance sheet, which then brings in monthly, recurring net interest income. The company expects that loans held on the balance sheet will be three times more profitable over their life than those sold to investors. In the second quarter, the first full quarter with Radius attached, LendingClub generated blowout earnings results . The bank turned a profit several quarters before it was supposed to, generated more than $204 million in revenue, and originated $2.7 billion of loans in the quarter. Management also increased its full-year guidance significantly. The stock rose roughly 50% in the week following the earnings report. I believe LendingClub's earnings on Oct. 27 could be another watershed moment for the stock. I think if investors see another strong and consistent quarter, they will reward the stock nicely because several of its competitors trade at huge premiums to the company. My one question about the quarter is if the surge of the delta variant in Q3 impacted the overall personal loan market and slowed demand. But if the market was active, I am very confident that LendingClub will generate strong earnings. Far more than just a basic website builder Nicholas Rossolillo (Wix.com): Wix has built quite the name for itself over the years as an easy-to-use platform for website development. Early this year, the company said it surpassed the 200 million registered user landmark, and management has stated it thinks half of all new websites could be created using Wix within the next five to seven years. That's quite the ambition. It's not just the company's no-code platform that is increasing adoption among small business owners, aspiring entrepreneurs, and web developers, though. Wix has an ever-expanding toolkit to help increase the functionality of the modern business's web and mobile app presence. Among these tools are drag-and-drop features that enable things like calendar scheduling, store and restaurant ordering, and shipping and fulfillment options -- tightly integrated with Wix payments, Wix point-of-sale hardware, or use with over 50 other third-party digital payment providers. Payments, e-commerce, and related services are driving impressive growth for the software firm. During Q2 2021, business solutions sales grew 75% year over year to $80.5 million. It represents only about one-quarter of Wix's total revenue, but at that pace these more advanced web capabilities will grow to encompass a much larger portion of the company's results (since subscription revenue to the basic web builder service grew at just a 24% pace in Q2). Shares of Wix have been hit hard as of late , in part because of an expected slowdown in overall growth trajectory due to the COVID-19 delta variant as well as lower free cash flow this year while the company spends heavily to support expansion. As a result, the stock trades for just shy of 10 times trailing-12-month sales as of this writing. Nevertheless, Wix's top team said to expect revenue growth of at least 22% in Q3 2021. This is an enduring growth story to watch during the upcoming earnings season, and if Wix continues to deliver on its projections, don't expect shares to remain down and out for too long.",

    "full_description": "After seeing China Evergrande ( OTC:EGRN.F ) on the edge of financial collapse, investors may be wondering if any stocks in their portfolios are vulnerable to a similar risk. In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers, Jason Hall, Neil Patel, and Demitri Kalogeropoulos discuss the importance of diversification and other essential strategies for long-term investors. Brian Withers: Question number 2, the China Evergrande auditor. If you're familiar, I don't know if, Jason, you've talked about this topic this week, I certainly haven't, but China Evergrande, what they call, got a little bit over its skis, got a little bit of aggressive with its debt and tried deduce its growth, and it got into a bit of a bind. It's in disaster mode and teetering on the edge of financial collapse, weighed down by almost $89 billion of debt and total liabilities in excess of $300 [laughs] billion. This is a disaster for investors. Let me just say that. Hopefully, none of our Fools out there are Evergrande owners. What's interesting is similar to other disasters, their auditor came in, and gave them, they said, \"You guys are fine.\" Unless you were paying attention to the tea leaves and stuff, there wasn't necessarily a canary in the coal mine here. How should investors avoid this situation? Do you look at the balance sheet, cash flow and debt in your investing decisions? Jason, let's take you first. Jason Hall: I think it's a good starting point. This is one of the reasons why I do invest so broadly. Because at the end of the day, Brian, you own what, 19 stocks now, or are you up to 20? Withers: Twenty. I'm up to 20. Hall: Wow. Withers: I bought a REIT, dude. Hall: Oh yeah, that's right. I knew that. I think it's one of those things unless you really have a pretty substantial amount of time, like a lot of us do, you spend your job is to do security analysis where you can really understand companies, the industries they operate in, spend the time to really get to know those businesses so then you can have a concentrated portfolio. Frankly, most of us can't do that. We just don't have the time. I think one of the best ways to think about avoiding that risk is by being diverse enough so that maybe a full position is one or two percent of your cost base is in a company. If things go badly, you still have 99 percent of your cost basis, so your downside risk is minimized by that. But I think also you do have to look at it from business and industry. For example, I own a lot of real estate stuff, utility companies that have a lot of debt, they take on a tremendous amount of debt, but they own long-term assets, that the debt is often secured by those things. It makes it more palatable, because there's a clear cadence and usually they get favorable debt terms and it's long term before its maturity and that kind of thing. Now, a software company on the other hand, I wouldn't want to see a lot of debt because they should have a pretty lean profile, and they should have cash margins and their business should be pretty lean. They shouldn't need to take on the same kind of debt. But with that said, you have to not let it be an excuse to buy a highly leveraged company in a leveraged industry, just because it's an industry that has a lot of leverage like AdLearn, for example, I know a lot of Stock Advisor members probably learn to with Seadrill , for example. Seadrill Limited was the offshore driller that went on a very aggressive building spree, took on a tremendous amount of debt to do it and then the oil market crashed. The company has actually gone through bankruptcy at least twice and I think is about to go through it a third time in a five-year period. A couple of things, so diversifying, and also thinking about industry within industry when it comes to leverage, and then not letting the excuse of this is a leveraged industry cause you to invest in a company that is too leveraged, so you manage it through those cadences. Neil Patel: That's a good point, Jason. I also like to dive into the balance sheet and the financial flexibility of the business because you want to have a company that can handle what happened over the past 18 months. You want to company that can handle what happened in 2008/2009. One thing I really look at is the cash position of the business and compare it to the company's total long-term debt. I also like to look at the interest payments and if the company is producing enough cash flow where let's say there is a meaningful hit to revenue, would they still be able to cover those interest payments? An example of a company that fits this description for me is Etsy . Etsy, they actually have a net debt position. They have 2.3 billion in debt on their balance sheet and only two billion in cash. The reason why I'm not turned away by that company is because if you look at the interest payment, it's trivial. All of Etsy's debt is convertible notes, so it's like less than 50 basis points of interest that they pay. If you look at their cash flow, Etsy producers 25, 30 percent operating cash flow margins, which is just ridiculous. That's a company that has more debt and cash on its balance sheet, but if you dig deeper into the financial statements, you'll see that they can whether whatever storm just on their way. It's because of that low interest rate on that debt, it's because of that high operating cash flow margin. Conversely, I think if you would've looked at Netflix , let's say 10 years ago, you would see a company earning through cash, you'd see a company borrowing a lot of debt, but you might be turned off from that company, but that situation where taking on debt at historically low interest rates was a good move for Netflix. Like Jason said, if you understood and had the time to really dive into the business and understand what management's long-term goal is, you would know that taking on debt and creating content and acquiring customers was the right move. But it all comes down to how much time are you willing to put into this? How much volatility can you handle. If you can't do that then diversity is the way to go. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Yeah, Neil, I agree. I think there's a lot of examples of companies using debt in good ways. I was looking through the Evergrande's stuff recently, I'm no auditor or accounting major, but I'd like to think that I saw the stat here today, that 42 percent of their debt, that's $37 billion, was set to come due within one year. That's just pretty amazing to me, that's quite a debt burden that I would probably put on the front sentence of every quarterly release if I was a company like that. [laughs] I would say, \"Oh, by the way, we have $40 billion of debt coming due within the next 12 months.\" But get to your point there, that's a reminder to me that that's another reason to like we've been saying invest in companies you understand. There's so many I would stay away from. Before I go into an international business in a market, I don't quite understand what debt instructions and debt markets I don't necessarily understand regulatory, things that I'm not really clear on. I would stay close to an industry, I do know or when they makes sense to me, or maybe a company that I deal with personally. A great example I like to have here is Home Depot . Obviously, everyone knows this, a huge retailer, the leading home improvement retailing giant. They've been taking on debt pretty steadily every year since 2014, a few billion dollars. But not because they need to. Home Depot, their earnings have been ballooning over all that time. Their margins are going up, their sales are going up, cash flow is amazing. But management has been prudently using debt at historically low rates, close to zero percent for a lot of that time to fund things like capital return programs and stock buybacks. Not super aggressive, but just in a balanced way and I call that just good effective capital efficiency, and that shows up in Home Depot's amazing metrics like return on invested capital. It's one of the highest in the entire industry, if not the whole stock market. Companies like that are great. Home Depot did not disappear then fold up during the Great Recession when sales dropped 40 percent for several years, and it's not likely to fold up using aggressive leverage. Now, you've got to trust the management team a little bit, but it's companies like that that I think I would start looking at before I branched into more aggressive plays. Withers: Go ahead, Jason. Hall: Brian, I just wanted to take a second and Neil was talking about Etsy. I just want to do a visual here of exactly what Neil was talking about, the cadence of how it's added dept to its balance sheets. Because it's easy to see these things and if you're not following Neil's explanation of the cash, thinking about their entire balance sheet and the expenses and the implications, it can make you walk away from things if you're too focused on the debt. This is just like looking at Etsy, how its debt has grown. Again, $2.3 billion in debt, and then again to Neil's point, look at that, the cash has just grown essentially right along with it. If you were ignoring that, the fact that the company is raising debt, but its cash flows and it's retaining some of that cash at the same time, it would be easy to assume well, maybe this is a company that's, this is not necessarily in the right direction. Now, can you guys see this next chart? This is what Neil was talking about in terms of its interest expense, $22 million a year, roughly. That's nothing. Then the investments that the company is making into building out its platform and growing sales, this is what its operating cash flow is doing. Operating cash flow is surging. Excess cash that it's generating to service its debt is enormous. The company, again, Demitri, you were talking about those current maturities of debt over at Evergrande? Kalogeropoulos: Uh-huh. Hall: Guess what, Etsy doesn't have any debt that's maturing this year, so having a good ladder of managing its debt maturities is a really important part of it. Neil, I love Etsy, I think it's great. Then Home Depot too, what they're doing is essentially the exact same thing in a more capital-intensive business. Patel: This ties perfectly into the previous question that we discussed, investors like us at the Fool, wondering who in their right mind would want to invest in Chinese Evergrande. But then you realize that these investors are playing a different game than you are. It's plain and simple. That somebody looks at that company, on every side of their transaction, there's a buyer and seller and so that's the perfect example of what we talked about previously, where people just have a different time horizon, have different goals and that applies to your investing decisions. Withers: I also wanted to point out where our members can find out about this information. I pulled up Etsy's latest SEC filing and it's called the 10-Q, which is the quarterly one, and the 10-K, which is the annual one. Just show you a little bit, you search for the word debt and I get to this note 7 debt section and talks about the 2021 convertible debt. They have capped call transactions, their 2020 debt, their 2019 debt, and their 2018 debt, and then you can see a schedule here. This is what I was looking for, is when is things coming due and how is it spread out and you should be able to see that. Jason made a great point about comparing interest payments to cash flow and things like that are other good ways to see if the debt is sustainable.",

There isn't much movement around federal legalization now, but state legalization will not slow down. As a result, the cannabis market will keep booming, thus taking pot stocks to greater highs. Two pure-play cannabis companies, Jushi Holdings ( OTC:JUSHF ) and Cresco Labs ( OTC:CRLBF ) , and another pot-related company, GrowGeneration ( NASDAQ:GRWG ) , are climbing the list of top marijuana stocks to buy and hold for the long term. Let's see why. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Cresco Labs This Illinois-based multi-state operator (MSO) might not have a large footprint nationally yet, but its revenue and profits are surging even with just 37 dispensaries across 10 states. In its second quarter, total revenue jumped a whopping 123% year over year to $210 million. Cresco's smart strategy of targeting key cannabis markets (such as Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio) that offer limited licenses has worked in its favor. These states restrict the number of licenses they offer and stores that can open in the state. This restricted competition has helped Cresco build a loyal customer base for its various brands like Mindy's Edibles, High Supply, Cresco Reserve, and more. It helped the company garner $101 million just from retail revenue. The boom in recreational cannabis in its home state, Illinois, has also been favorable for Cresco. The market is on its way to cross last year's $1 billion in total recreational sales. With 11 Sunnyside retail stores in the state, it can take advantage of this opportunity. It has also helped Cresco report a net profit of $2.7 million in the second quarter, a drastic improvement from its $41 million loss in the year-ago period. 2. Jushi Holdings This Florida-based vertically integrated cannabis company might be small by market cap ($669 million), but it has tremendous potential to shine as the industry expands. With 20 retail stores nationwide, its total revenue jumped a whopping 219% year over year to $48 million in its second quarter, which ended June 30. The company gives credit for this growth to four key markets: Pennsylvania, Illinois, California, and Virginia. Jushi has followed the same strategy as Cresco by targeting markets that offer limited licenses, leading to a net profit of $4.8 million in the second quarter, compared to a net loss of $9.3 million in the year-ago period. California and Illinois already have a booming cannabis market. Virginia's recreational market will open up in 2024, while efforts are ongoing in Pennsylvania, which could present ample opportunities for this small-cap MSO. Since its second-quarter results, the company has opened two more stores in Pennsylvania, bringing its total to 22 retail locations nationwide. It also recently acquired an Ohio-based medical cannabis processor that gave Jushi access to an 8,000-square-foot facility in the state. With a stable balance sheet, the company is well prepared to expand further as more and more states legalize cannabis. It ended the second quarter with $126.8 million in cash and short-term investments and $85.1 million in principal amount of total debt. 3. GrowGeneration Even though GrowGeneration isn't a pure-play cannabis company, this Denver-based hydroponics supplier has tremendous prospects. It sells supplies and equipment needed by cannabis growers. With 58 stores nationwide at the end of the second quarter, the company grew revenue 190% year over year to $126 million. The company also recorded adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) profit of $14.5 million, versus $4.4 million in the year-ago period. Net profit of $6.7 million was also better than $2.5 million in last year's second quarter. In August, GrowGeneration acquired hydroponic equipment and indoor gardening store Hoagtech Hydroponics in Washington. The company believes the addition could help generate $15 million in revenue annually. It also raised its full-year 2021 revenue guidance to a range of $455 million to $475 million and plans to have over 70 garden center locations by the end of the year. If it achieves the upper end of the guidance, it will represent a 146% increase from 2020 revenue -- impressive growth. With rising sales and an expanding national footprint , GrowGeneration is a lucrative cannabis buy right now. Jushi Holdings being a penny stock might make investors skeptical, but its long-term growth prospects are tempting. With solid fundamentals, all three cannabis stocks have the potential to skyrocket when federal legalization happens, making investors rich. All three stocks are trading almost 50% below their 52-week highs, making this the right time to include them in your portfolio.",

    "full_description": "Zoom Video Communications ( NASDAQ:ZM ) was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the positive impact on its business. And despite the world starting to return to normalcy, one of our Fool.com contributors decided to add to his position. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on Oct. 11 , Jon Quast discusses the reasoning behind his recent investment decision. Matt Frankel: This is Zoom and I'm really curious to see what Jon has to say about this. I didn't realize you bought this, so give us a rundown on why you like Zoom so much right now. Jon Quast: I think that I started acquiring Zoom stock, maybe, six-ish months ago. Then I just recently added to my position. It's been one that I've been dollar-cost averaging over time. We've talked a lot about Zoom in recent episodes of Live and Backstage Pass . I just want to share something here. Before I share my screen actually, I wanted to share real quick both Latch and Zoom for me. I'm going to talk about optionality. The thing that I love about this concept of optionality is that when there's a low cost to the opportunity, but a potential high payout of the opportunity, that can be a really powerful thing. Both Latch ( NASDAQ:LTCH ) and Zoom have that in my opinion, but we're going to look at some optionality with Zoom and why I really like it. First of all, we'll just say that Zoom has, by and large, held onto their core customers in Zoom meetings. That's their No. 1 product, that is what most people or most businesses, excuse me, have, is this Zoom meetings product. We're lapping the pandemic and they're holding onto that. They're not growing like they were in that category, but they are holding on to the majority of the business that they have. Now they have optionality in Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms. Less than 5% of their current customers have Zoom Phone product, less than 5% have Zoom Rooms. Zoom Phone is the digital upgrade, the Zoom operating system of their internal phone infrastructure. Let's call it that. Zoom Rooms. This is the modernization, the digitization of the old-fashioned conference room, making this a literal physical space, but it's a Zoom Room, adding that onto the existing product. This is a case study that they get from Zoomtopia, their Zoom annual investor event. This is just one case study from a large financial services company. They started out in fiscal year in '19 with Zoom Meetings and Zoom Room. This is what those things were doing. Over time, those two products have grown and what this company is spending. What you see right here, this greenish blue, I don't know if that's green or blue, but the circle here, basically, when they added Zoom Phone to their subscription, it's 4X now, what they originally were spending just three years ago. It shows how tremendous the optionality here is with Zoom Phone. Like I said, less than 5% of customers currently have Zoom Phone. What if half of their customers were to upgrade to Zoom Phone? Not every case is going to be 4X what they were originally spending, but it shows that there is incredible upside just with Zoom Phone. Case study No. 2, large retail company initially had meetings in Zoom Room, but they bought Zoom Phone here in fiscal year '20. Now in fiscal year 2022, they're spending 3.7 times what they were back when they initially got Zoom in fiscal year 2019. Again, just three years, now they're 3.7X in their spending. That's incredible. Those two products, how much it could potentially add to Zoom's revenue? We talk about the slowing growth with Zoom, after the pandemic. Now we're moving past it. Now it's slowing. They're not acquiring as many customers as they were before. I really liked the potential merger with Five9 ( NASDAQ:FIVN ) . I really thought that that was going to jump-start the customer growth again because you've got the customer bases from both, but that's not happening anymore. The customer growth has slowed, but look at what the revenue potential growth is if they can just get these current customers to upgrade to new products. Then Zoom Apps, in my opinion, is the ultimate optionality lever on the market today. For those who don't know, Zoom has created an ecosystem where you can have an app natively run inside the Zoom meetings. What does this look like? For example, DocuSign ( NASDAQ:DOCU ) has created an app that is used natively within Zoom. You're in a Zoom meeting and you are inside of the Zoom meeting signing something on DocuSign. The apps take place inside. They have created a $100 million venture fund to fund app development. Zoom management doesn't know where this is going to go. In fact, they noted that one of their app developers is working on launching video games inside of Zoom meetings. Zoom management is like, ''Well, we didn't think of that.\" That's the whole point of this $100 million dollar venture fund. They are just funding developers. You have an idea, here's some money. We'd love to see what you do with it. What's interesting is this is less than 2% of Zoom's cash. Less than 2% is $100 million. They have $5.1 billion in cash and it's growing. There's very little downside to doing this, but what is the upside potential? The upside potential is a use case that even Zoom management hadn't even thought of. This is why I like Zoom going forward. I see its core product as being sticky and they're retaining what they have and it's extremely profitable as is, but I see optionality levers going into the future.",

McDonald's unparalleled brand awareness, and what that does for profitability, surely figured in the company's announcement last month of a 7% increase in its dividend. This marked the 45th consecutive annual dividend increase, placing McDonald's firmly among the Dividend Aristocrats , which is made up of the S&P 500 companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 years straight. This raises the question: Should dividend growth investors show McDonald's some love and buy its stock at current prices? Image source: Getty Images. Strong operating results Through the first half of this year, McDonald's has served up robust results to its shareholders. For starters, McDonald's revenue in the first half of 2021 surged 29.9% year from a year earlier to $11.01 billion. And while this revenue figure was skewed because of the hit to business in last year's first half amid COVID-19 disruptions, McDonald's revenue also grew at a healthy clip compared to 2019, rising 6.9% from pre-COVID revenue of $10.30 billion. This suggests that the fundaments for McDonald's, with almost 40,000 franchised and company operated restaurants, are stronger than ever. A key factor that has allowed McDonald's to come out of the pandemic stronger than it was heading into it is the company's emphasis on digitally connecting with customers. The McDonald's app is the most downloaded quick-service restaurant app in the U.S., company Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said during the second-quarter 2021 earnings call . McDonald's digital sales grew 70% in the second quarter from a year earlier to $8 billion, which is an indication of the company's digital sales growth potential. McDonald's non-GAAP earnings per share ( EPS ) more than doubled year over year to $4.29 in the first half of 2021. But again, this isn't very surprising considering the pandemic restrictions McDonald's faced last year. What's more impressive is that McDonald's managed to increase its non-GAAP EPS by 16.3% this year from the first half of 2019, when it earned $3.69 per share. Based on this year's revenue and EPS gains, McDonald's has recovered from COVID-19 headwinds and growth has rebounded to pre-pandemic rates. This bodes well for shareholders. A solid balance sheet While it's encouraging that McDonald's is turning out strong operating results, it's just as important that the underpinnings of the company's balance sheet are fundamentally sound. Let's take a look at McDonald's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and compare it to McDonald's interest expenses, which is another way of saying the interest coverage ratio. As McDonald's has rebounded from COVID-19, its interest coverage ratio has soared from 4.5 through the first half of last year to 8.3 in the first half of this year. Put another way, McDonald's EBIT would need to plunge almost 90%, or interest expenses would need to soar (or some combination of the two), before McDonald's would be unable to service its debt. Yet even amid the COVID lockdowns, McDonald's EBIT fell only 38.8% in the first half of 2020 from the first half of 2019. A decline of 90% in EBIT seems quite unlikely. And since 95% of McDonald's debt at the end of last year was fixed-rate, McDonald's is largely shielded from rising interest rates bumping up its interest expenses. Therefore, solvency issues should be far from mind. A reasonably priced Dividend Aristocrat McDonald's is a dividend stock that investors shouldn't overlook . The stock's track record of almost a half-century of dividend increases appears to be just the beginning. Apart from the strength of McDonald's earnings and balance sheet, the company dividend payout ratio is poised to be in the high-50% range this year. This leaves McDonald's with a buffer that should allow it to raise the dividend more or less in line with projected annual earnings growth in the high single-digit percentages during the next few years. At about $249 a share, McDonald's isn't cheap, nor is it overvalued. Based on the analyst consensus estimate of $9.47 in non-GAAP EPS, McDonald's is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.3. This is only moderately higher than the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 21.3, which doesn't seem out of line for a company of this quality. That's why I would advise dividend growth investors to consider McDonald's 2.3% dividend yield, if they haven't already, and to buy on any weakness in the future.",

Read on to see why they think these sturdy, dividend-paying companies will put your portfolio in a better position to thrive. Image source: Getty Images. Strong demand can power this chip leader higher Keith Noonan (Broadcom): Semiconductors make the world go round. Whether they're for mobile devices, data centers, cars, or even your refrigerator, chips are one of the critical components underpinning business and everyday life. Recent fabrication constraints and supply shortages have generally driven semiconductor prices higher, and the overall chip market will likely see additional pricing inflation. However, leading players in the space could also continue to put up a relatively strong performance amid these trends. Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) is a maker of connectivity and networking chips that also has a growing infrastructure software business courtesy of some big acquisitions in recent years. The company has been delivering strong sales and earnings growth, and it looks to still be in the early stages of benefiting from the 5G upgrade cycle and other influential connectivity trends. The company managed to grow revenue 16% year over year in the third quarter, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share jumped roughly 29% compared to the prior-year period. Broadcom's yield of roughly 2.8% may fall short of what some investors seeking ultra high-yield are looking for, but the chip maker's payout growth history suggests that the company will continue to raise its dividend at a rate that significantly exceeds the rate of inflation. The company's last payout hike came in at 11%, and the semiconductor company's strong free cash flow generation and impressive track record of boosting the cash it returns to shareholders indicate that investors can look forward to another significant dividend raise before the year is out. After increasing its payout roughly 253% over the last five years, the rate of hikes is admittedly slowing down some, but Broadcom is still a great dividend growth stock. With a sizable and still fast-growing payout, a business that looks poised to benefit from ongoing tailwinds despite broader economic uncertainty, and shares trading at a reasonable 18 times this year's expected earnings, this is one tech company that can help investors thrive through inflation. Verizon is on its way to Dividend Aristocrat status Jamal Carnette (Verizon) : Income investors are always on the hunt for up-and-coming Dividend Aristocrats, S&P 500 companies with a 25-year history of paying and raising dividends annually. At present, this selective list only includes 65 stocks, which shows how difficult it is to grow market capitalization and raise payouts to shareholders. Verizon ( NYSE:VZ ) is well on its way to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat. Last month, the company announced a dividend increase to $2.56 annually, its 15th consecutive year of raises. The payout is well supported by the company's cash flow; investors need not worry about a dividend cut. Verizon's stock continues to underperform the market, and shares are down 9% year to date. Investors are concerned about Verizon's growth potential, particularly in its cable TV and wireline telephony business as both are experiencing a secular decline. Despite that, Verizon's third-quarter earnings came in better than expected: The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41 and revenue of $32.9 billion, up 4.3% year over year, both higher than analyst estimates on the strength of its wireless segment. Shares rose 2.5% on the day as investors cheered better-than-expected wireless subscriber growth. Verizon's underperformance presents an interesting opportunity. The company is significantly undervalued versus the greater market. Shares of Verizon currently trade hands at 9.7 times forward earnings versus 21.9 times for the S&P 500 . The Verizon dividend yield of 4.8% is nearly three times larger than the greater index. Most investors are overlooking Verizon's growth driver in the form of 5G connectivity . Verizon has spent billions building out its wireless 5G network, but the long-term monetization is just beginning. Augmented-reality applications, autonomous vehicles, and smart-city applications will require significantly more connectivity, and Verizon should be able to capitalize on this increased demand. With Verizon, you're getting a cheap company paying a massive (and growing) dividend with the growth driver of 5G connectivity. Long-term value investors would be well suited to owning shares of this future Dividend Aristocrat. As inflation-proof as it gets Jason Hall (Brookfield Infrastructure) : The rare top-tier of businesses can raise prices with inflation, but their underlying costs don't necessarily move up at the same rate. That's powerful, especially for dividend stocks. And it's largely the case for Brookfield Infrastructure ( NYSE:BIP ) ( NYSE:BIPC ) , which operates largely as a \"toll booth\" business, operating infrastructure assets that move goods, people, data, and energy. For many of these, underlying expenses are relatively fixed, with the variable parts of the expenses more tied to the volume of product moved than the cost of that good that it may be moving (often for a customer who is just paying to use the asset). But -- this is where it gets good -- many of its operating units do have inflation escalators built into their contracts, boosting revenues and cash flows even if expenses don't go higher. In the second-quarter earnings release, for example, the word \"inflation\" was used five times. In all five cases, inflation was a positive for its results. There's a lot more to like about Brookfield Infrastructure besides its inflation-proof structure. It's one of the safest dividend stocks to own because of the critically important assets it owns and its very strong balance sheet. It's also in absolute growth mode, having invested almost $3 billion on new projects this year. That's a great sign that it will continue to meet the goal of 5%+ dividend increases every year, making the 3.4% yield at recent prices even more attractive.",

No bother, though. If you're looking for a solid income generator with some gradual stock price growth over time, IBM is still a good pick. The culprit for much of the lackluster financial update was the managed infrastructure business that will soon be separated from IBM, which was still reporting under the \"Global Technology Services\" segment in Q3.

Stock prices can go wild during these periods as companies post figures that either beat or fall short of investor expectations. But these short-term reactions don't mean it's time to bail on solid stocks. Three tech names that recently reported are IBM ( NYSE:IBM ) , Duck Creek Technologies ( NASDAQ:DCT ) , and Lam Research ( NASDAQ:LRCX ) . Here's why three Fool.com contributors think they're worth owning. The new IBM puts up weak sales numbers... for now Nicholas Rossolillo (IBM): Ahead of the Nov. 3 spinoff of its managed infrastructure business (which is now called Kyndryl ), IBM reported results that fell short on some fronts. Earnings per share of $2.52 beat the consensus analyst expectation by a penny, but revenue of $17.6 billion was shy of the $17.8 billion consensus. Shares fell nearly 10% following the update. No bother, though. If you're looking for a solid income generator with some gradual stock price growth over time, IBM is still a good pick. The culprit for much of the lackluster financial update was the managed infrastructure business that will soon be separated from IBM, which was still reporting under the \"Global Technology Services\" segment in Q3. That segment's revenue fell 5% year over year to $6.15 billion. As a result, total revenue was up just 0.3% from last year. Ex-Kyndryl, though, IBM said it grew overall sales by 2%. Granted, 2% growth is short of the mid-single-digit percentage rate of revenue expansion management said to expect from the new IBM post-Kyndryl spinoff . The company said it's still working on tidying up to meet that stated goal. But the company is nonetheless already delivering on its free cash flow generation outlook. Excluding non-recurring charges of $566 million in Q3 related to separating Kyndryl, IBM's free cash flow would have been up 6% from last year. Free cash flow generated over the last 12-month stretch totaled $9.22 billion (after subtracting $1.84 billion in Kyndryl charges), valuing this old tech firm at just 10 times free cash flow. Put another way, IBM remains highly profitable, and profit margins will dramatically improve even more once the legacy operations of Kyndryl are independent. IBM generates ample free cash to service its dividend, which currently yields 4.6% after the most recent sell-off. If investment income is what you're after, this is still a stock worth buying following the Q3 report. Image source: Getty Images. If it walks like a growth stock and quacks like a growth stock... Anders Bylund (Duck Creek Technologies): Insurance software specialist Duck Creek Technologies may be the most interesting company you've never heard of. The company has been around for two decades, by turns as an independent business and a part of professional services giant Accenture ( NYSE:ACN ) . Duck Creek reentered the public market in the summer of 2020, capping a strategy update that transformed the company into a pure software-as-a-service operation. Since then, the company has delivered year-over-year revenue growth in the 20% range while lifting the bottom line closer to positive territory. The veteran company's young stock traded largely sideways for more than a year, until the fourth-quarter report hit the newswires on Oct. 14. True to firm, Duck Creek posted adjusted earnings of $0.02 per share on top-line revenues of $70.9 million. Your average Wall Street analyst would have settled for $0.01 per share and $69.1 million, respectively. And the stock plunged 22% lower the next day. That market reaction is just silly. Sure, Duck Creek issued full-year guidance just below the Street consensus for the just-started 2022 fiscal year. That's enough to make some investors look elsewhere, no further questions asked. But Duck Creek's results have been consistently above the high end of management's guidance ranges all year long, and I see no reason why management's conservative guidance habits would end here. This company offers SaaS tools to manage property and casualty insurances, spanning the entire life cycle of insurance policies with an eye toward customizing the Duck Creek OnDemand platform to the needs of each specific client. Business is booming and the stock looks much more affordable after last week's dramatic haircut. In many ways, Duck Creek's combination of a long operating history and affordable shares makes it a more attractive buy today than fellow insurance technology maven Lemonade ( NYSE:LMND ) , which I already own. Adding a couple of Duck Creek shares to my portfolio makes a lot of sense right now. Investors are mistaking supply chain constraints for the end of the semi cycle Billy Duberstein (Lam Research): Lam Research's stock fell after its recent earnings report, but these discounted prices may not last long, giving investors the opportunity to buy this top-tier semi equipment supplier with one of the highest returns on equity in the market. The stock is now much cheaper than many tech peers and even trades at a discount to the overall market, at just 16 times this year's earnings estimates. In the September quarter, Lam beat earnings expectations, but missed on revenue and gave softer-than-expected guidance. Investors seem to be debating whether this marks a turn in the semi-cycle, or whether the muted results are merely the result of supply chain constraints. Management was very clear that the supply chain was the culprit on the conference call with analysts , and it's been well-documented that supply chains are jammed up all over the world, affecting a broad swath of companies. So, it appears supply chain is the main problem. Naturally, when a company misses on the top line, the market usually doesn't take kindly. That's especially true of semicap companies that have been somewhat cyclical in the past. For these companies, some of the investor base is likely playing the cycle, and may jump off at the earliest sign of deceleration. But if the miss is supply-oriented, which it appears to be, it would actually mean the current upcycle would remain strong for a longer period of time, as unfilled orders today eventually get filled later on. CEO Tim Archer said in response to an analyst question: I would say lead times have stretched out to the point where our visibility into demand into '22 is better than usual. And so I don't think that the types of initial indicators [of a cyclical downturn] that you're talking about are things we're seeing right now. We feel much more constrained by supply chain challenges and ability to meet shipments than an over-shipping situation. Lam also now has the ability to repurchase more shares at discounted prices, which could look mighty smart a few years out. Last quarter, Lam repurchased $1.24 billion, even more than the $1.18 billion in made in net income. Lam also raised its dividend by 15% recently. So, management is generously rewarding shareholders, returning over 100% of its free cash flow this year. While management teams can make mistakes, Lam's leaders appear quite confident semicap equipment demand will continue to grow next year and beyond, even though sales are already up strongly in 2021. That's because digital transformation is now an imperative coming out of the pandemic, causing a global increase in demand for semiconductors. And given that each semiconductor node progression is becoming more capital-intensive, equipment companies serving leading-edge manufacturers are set up very well for the rest of this decade -- yet these stocks tend to trade cheaply to the market. That's a pretty good position for Foolish long-term investors to be in.",

Shopify: Helping businesses grow online Brian Withers (Shopify): Shopify has grown from humble beginnings to a $4.4 billion annual run rate business, facilitating almost $120 billion in online purchases in 2020. With its fantastic business results, market-trouncing stock appreciation has followed. In the year following its IPO, investors could have purchased shares of this incredible company for a jaw-dropping $20 per share, representing a 7,437% return since 2015. While that kind of amazing return may not be possible going forward, it's not too late to pick up shares of this high-quality business and still make market-beating returns. Let's look at why. First, the company is still growing at a rapid pace. Even as the economy opens up and more brick-and-mortar stores are welcoming back in-person shoppers, the company posted 57% year-over-year revenue gains on top of a 40% year-over-year boost in online purchases. The company has become even more profitable as the added coronavirus traffic has helped the company scale its costs and pad its bottom line. Metrics Q2 2020 Q1 2021 Q2 2021 QoQ change YoY change Revenue $714 million $989 million $1.1 billion 13% 57% Gross merchandise volume $30.1 billion $37.3 billion $42.2 billion 13% 40% Income from operations $0.4 million $119 million $139 million 17% 34,750% Data source: Company earnings releases, calculations by author. Second, this \"overnight success\" from the coronavirus has been a long time coming. In 2015, Shopify hosted 165,000 merchants on its platform. Today, a few short years later, there are more than 10 times that number-- 1.7 million merchants depend on Shopify every day with their online stores. These merchants sell products in 175 countries around the world, giving this online e-commerce player truly global exposure to the rise of e-commerce. Looking just at the small and medium business segment, management estimates its addressable market to be $153 billion. So its $4.4 billion annual revenue run rate is a small sub-3% share of the market. Lastly, Shopify benefits when its merchants on its platform are successful. In addition to monthly subscription fees for its platform, Shopify takes a small cut of every sale with its merchant solutions segment, which makes up 70% of its most recent quarter's revenue. This segment has grown faster than the subscription services business and could fuel growth even if new merchants don't join the platform. Given this alignment, the company and its management team are highly incentivized to help these entrepreneurs grow their businesses, which is something shareholders should love. Investors may look at this $175 billion-plus market cap company and think the growth is over, but they couldn't be more wrong. Shopify will continue its mission to make commerce better for everyone and, along the way, make shareholders happy too. It's not too late to add this high-quality operator to your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Netflix: Yes, its growth story can still continue Will Healy (Netflix): Netflix stock has risen by almost 53,000% since its public debut in 2002. Though it pioneered the streaming industry, numerous high-profile companies such as Disney , Amazon , and AT&T have pivoted into streaming and become competitors. Despite past increases and current challenges, new investors could still earn outsized returns as the company remains in growth mode. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate for the global streaming business of 21% through 2028, industry growth that will likely continue to bolster Netflix. The company also continues to capitalize. According to Parrot Analytics, despite global market share falling from 65% two years ago, Netflix still holds about 50% of the worldwide market. Also, over the last year, total membership grew by just over 9% to nearly 214 million. Moreover, the Q3 2021 earnings call highlighted the popularity of shows such as Squid Game and La Casa de Papel. This shows the degree to which it has begun to succeed outside of the U.S. The company's financials also highlight this expansion. In the first nine months of 2021, revenue of $22 billion increased 20% compared with the same period in 2020. That took profits 103% higher to $4.5 billion over the same period. During this time, the company has also begun to address one critical financial obstacle. Over the last 12 months, its long-term debt of $14.8 billion fell by about $1 billion. This is notable, as rising debts and negative free cash flows characterized its finances in past years as it funded more content development. Still, even as programming development resumed following the pandemic, Netflix has managed $410 million in free cash flow in the first nine months of this year. Admittedly, the picture for the third quarter looks less rosy. In that period, revenue grew by only 16% as its locked-down customers resumed their offline activities. Free cash flow also turned negative again as content development has restarted. Moreover, Netflix has risen by roughly 24% over the last 12 months amid growth concerns stemming from fewer of its customers locking down. However, its P/E ratio currently stands at about 67. While that has risen modestly in recent months, it remains far below the triple-digit valuations of the last few years, making Netflix stock a relative bargain. Admittedly, investors should not expect another 53,000% gain over the next 20 years. Nonetheless, with its subscriber base continuing to boost revenue and net income, its comparatively low P/E and the expected industry growth could help new investors profit from the Netflix story.

MercadoLibre: Early days for fintech and e-commerce Danny Vena (MercadoLibre): When it comes to missed investment opportunities, one company cited fairly often is MercadoLibre ( NASDAQ:MELI ) . Many investors passed on the Latin American e-commerce and digital payments leader due to concerns about political instability, rampant inflation, and poor infrastructure in the region. While some slept on the opportunity, investors had several chances to get in below MercadoLibre's 2007 IPO price of $18. Those with the foresight to invest in the stock early on were able to ratchet up gains of more than 8,700% (as of this writing). Yet those who invested as late as early 2017 have still enjoyed gains of nearly 1,000%, illustrating that when it comes to a great company, it's never too late. It helps to put MercadoLibre's success in context. Even as the company dealt with the unique challenges of Latin America outlined above, it became the undisputed e-commerce and fintech leader . Yet the opportunity remains vast and is still in the early stages. Latin America has a population of nearly 662 million, nearly twice that of the U.S. At the same time, e-commerce sales in Latin America accounted for roughly 5.6% of total retail sales, less than half of the U.S. rate of 13.6%. This shows a lot of untapped growth yet to be had. There's also a significant opportunity for Mercado Pago, the company's fintech business. Latin America is largely a cash-based society and roughly 70% of the population doesn't have a bank account. The result is one of the largest unbanked/underbanked populations in the developing world. That factor alone has helped Mercado Pago in becoming one of the leaders in digital payments in the region. Mercado Pago partnered with local convenience stores, allowing users to make cash deposits directly to its app. This eliminated the need for a bank account, opening up its services to a vast new unbanked clientele. This digital payment method became so popular that it made the leap, first to other e-commerce sites, then to brick-and-mortar stores. MercadoLibre's results tell the tale. In the second quarter, net revenue surged 103% year over year in local currencies. Revenue from e-commerce grew 101%, while fintech revenue jumped 104%. At the same time, operating expenses increased just 79%, dropping more to the bottom line, as operating income increased 67%. The company boasts nearly 76 million unique active users, up 47% year over year. At the same time, the number of items sold jumped 37% and the number of payment transactions surged 80%. These growth metrics illustrate the fact that MercadoLibre still has a long runway ahead. Even after an epic run, investors who buy the stock today will almost certainly be richly rewarded.",

Here's what makes Fisker ( NYSE:FSR ) , United Parcel Service ( NYSE:UPS ) , and Emerson Electric ( NYSE:EMR ) all great buys now. Image source: Getty Images. An EV stock to park in your portfolio Scott Levine (Fisker ): Revving up to present its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 3, Fisker is an electric vehicle company that is a fairly new option for investors, having made its market debut almost exactly one year ago. Those who follow the EV industry closely will surely recognize the company's name; however, it's also likely that many investors are unfamiliar with the EV start-up considering the flurry of EV companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition company deals recently. Add to this the fact that Fisker doesn't have any vehicles on the road yet, and it's probable that Fisker is not on many growth investors' radars. But it certainly should be. Between the company's disruptive approach to financing and the stock trading at around $14 -- 55% below its 52-week high -- it certainly warrants consideration . One of the biggest challenges facing EV makers is the hesitancy that prospective customers have regarding charging their vehicles. Helping to allay these concerns, Fisker offers customers who find that they're not as charged up about going electric as they thought they'd be the option to return leased vehicles at any time without penalty. Management's willingness to implement an innovative approach to vehicle leasing suggests that it's not only cognizant of a potential roadblock to its success, but that it's not willing to yield to convention. As of early August, Fisker has 17,500 reservations for its Ocean SUV, indicating that there's already interest in the company's offering. By 2025, management is targeting annual sales of 200,000 to 250,000 -- a year in which it expects to expand its product offerings to four vehicles and which it expects to recognize a sizable improvement in its financials. While the company expects to generate free cash flow of negative $300 million in 2022, it forecasts free cash flow of $1.9 billion in 2025. That's the type of growth that can electrify investors' excitement. UPS has long-term upside but may face near-term setbacks Daniel Foelber (United Parcel Service): America's largest package delivery company, UPS, reports Q3 earnings on Tuesday. In addition to watching the usual suspects like the top and bottom line, margins, and other financial figures, investors will likely have their eyes peeled and their ears perked to gain insight into management's thoughts on supply chain constraints and the labor shortage. Investors following the package delivery space know that FedEx and UPS report earnings about six weeks apart instead of at the same time. This staggered schedule is convenient because it provides more frequent insight into industrywide headwinds and tailwinds. FedEx's most recent earnings report illustrated the sheer magnitude that the tight labor market and challenging supply chain are having on its margins. Its quarter wasn't pretty, and FedEx stock fell hard , dragging down UPS with it. To combat inflation, FedEx is raising prices next year. Investors should listen to UPS management's commentary on these topics to see how it expects to navigate market challenges, and the extent that it, too, will raise prices (if at all). In addition to these short-term talking points, growth investors will likely monitor UPS' e-commerce growth , rebound in business-to-business sales, and international performance. UPS is a value stock that has been transforming into a growth stock over the last few years because it's leaned into previously untapped markets. Its investments to grow its e-commerce offering have made it a preferred shipping and logistics partner for small and medium-sized businesses. Investors should gird their loins if UPS expects a sizable impact to its short-term performance due to macroeconomic factors. But as long as the big picture remains intact, UPS is one of the best industrial stocks on the market today . Emerson Electric is about to enter a growth phase Lee Samaha (Emerson Electric): It's been a long time coming, but energy-related spending is making a comeback. That's great news for companies with substantive process automation businesses like Emerson Electric. In total, oil and gas make up around 19% of Emerson's sales with chemicals and refining contributing another 11% and 6%. Process automation is the processing of raw materials into an initial product. As a result, spending in the industry tends to be lumpy and contingent on customers feeling confident in the long-term outlook for their end markets. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a stalling of investment within the processing industry. However, oil services companies like Halliburton are talking about an extended upcycle in oil and gas spending. Meanwhile, Emerson's process automation rival Honeywell International noted that its refining catalyst and absorbents orders surged by 30% in the second quarter. That's important because it suggests refining investment is coming back, and as Honeywell's management noted , that usually flows through into increased spending in process automation down the line. Everything points to a cyclical recovery in Emerson's process automation. Meanwhile, the company's commercial and residential solutions segment's (climate technology, energy efficiency, refrigeration) orders were up a whopping 43% in the trailing three months to June, so future revenue growth is assured. And finally, the recent deal to take a 55% stake in industrial software company Aspen Technology adds another string to the bow of Emerson's software expansion strategy. All told, Emerson looks well set for growth in the coming years.",

Earnings season ramps up with a flood of fresh earnings reports over the next few trading days. Let's take a closer look at a few highly anticipated announcements from this list, by Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , McDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ) , and eBay ( NASDAQ:EBAY ) . Image source: Getty Images. 1. Apple's holiday outlook Apple announces its fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday, and expectations could hardly be higher heading into this week's report. The iPhone maker has refreshed its entire product lineup at an ideal time, given that demand for premium consumer electronics is soaring. That stellar selling environment helps explain why most investors who follow the stock are looking for Apple to add an incredible $20 billion to its Q4 sales base, with revenue reaching $85 billion. Wall Street will be watching for confirmation of the popularity of new hardware products like the iPhone 13, and Apple's growing services offerings that carry much higher profit margins. The big number to watch on Thursday will be Apple's outlook for the critical holiday shopping season. This forecast will incorporate the latest demand trends, but also any supply chain issues. CEO Tim Cook and his team tend to be conservative with their short-term predictions, though, and so investors shouldn't be rattled by a seemingly weak outlook on Thursday. 2. McDonald's customer traffic McDonald's has some big questions to answer for investors in its Wednesday report. The fast-food titan returned to sales growth in the previous quarter, but COVID-19 challenges returned in many key markets in Q3. We'll learn this week whether Mickey D's lost its positive momentum from these outbreaks. Keep an eye on customer traffic, which hadn't recovered fully even by mid-2021. McDonald's growth outlook will be especially bright if it can return to traffic gains even as its mobile ordering channel keeps expanding. But competition is heading up in that niche, and in the drive-through segment that the company dominates today. We'll get key updates on McDonald's competitive posture 3. eBay's take rate eBay's stock has trounced the market so far in 2021, but that outperformance will be tested with its Wednesday earnings report. Most of the online marketplace's growth and financial metrics have been moving in the right direction lately. Its buyer base and sales volumes are much higher today than they were before the pandemic struck. eBay is also pushing into attractive new categories, including advertising and payments processing. The best news is that those initiatives are raising the value that eBay can provide to its sellers, and that success is allowing it to charge more for its services. The company's take rate, or seller fees, rose to over 11% of sales in Q2 – a new high . Look for eBay to work toward deeper engagement with sellers and buyers this quarter through improvements to the shopping and purchasing experiences. Management will also target several new attractive demand niches, such as collectable sneakers and luxury watches. On the financial front, look for eBay to again announce industry-leading cash flow and operating margins, thanks to its asset-light operating model. That middleman selling approach restrains its growth potential but can lead to cash flow and profitability that's far above the rates experienced by more traditional e-commerce retailers .",

    "content": "New Delhi, Oct 24:  With an aim to increase rice bran oil production to 18 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) to ease import of edible oils, the Centre has requested the states to assess the potential and enhance capacity of the rice mills for its maximum extraction. The current production stands at approximately 11 LMT, and the government contends the potential is approximately 18 LMT. Therefore, the states have been requested to assess the potential of rice bran oil production in the rice clusters located in their respective states and also enhance the capacity of rice mills so as to ensure that maximum rice bran oil is extracted. Major rice producing states/UTs have been requested to advise the authorities concerned to promote setting up of rice bran oil plants in rice milling clusters. \"States such as Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab have already shown interest and agreed to set up rice bran oil solvent extraction plants,\" said Food Secretary, Sudhanshu Pandey. Rice bran is used in confectionery products such as bread, snacks, cookies and biscuits. The defatted bran is also used as cattle feed, organic fertiliser (compost), medicinal purpose, and in wax making. Although compared to traditional oils, rice bran oil's direct consumption is very less, however, it is regularly used in soap and fatty acids manufacturing. It is also used in cosmetics, synthetic fibres, plasticisers, detergents, and emulsifiers. This is where the government is seeking to replace palm oil with rice bran oil to avoid importing the former at a huge cost to the exchequer. As per government data from 2018, rice bran oil production was 9.20 lakh tonnes in 2014-15, 9.90 lakh tonnes in 2015-16, and 10.31 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. Earlier in the year, the sale of fortified rice bran oil on commercial basis was launched by NAFED on June 15 through its multiple outlets in Delhi/NCR. An MoU was signed between NAFED and Food Corporation of India for the production and marketing of fortified rice kernel. \"This will provide easy access to NAFED branded high quality rice bran oil, which will also give a boost to the indigenous oil manufacturing industry,\" an official said, adding, this initiative by NAFED \"will significantly reduce the country's consumption dependence on imported edible oil in future\". Recently, the government directed the FCI to organise state level interactive workshops with the rice millers and field offices to assess their technological requirements. The government also said that it has carried out consultations with the states having major paddy/rice clusters for details such as number of rice mills and their milling capacity, total rice bran production, rice bran sent for cattle feed, rice bran sent for solvent extraction plant and number of mills required up gradation.",

    "full_description": "Moderna ( NASDAQ:MRNA ) is no longer the seemingly invincible, high-flying stock that it once was. Its shares are now close to 30% down from the high set in early August. And that reflects a bit of a rebound over the last few days. There are plenty of reasons why the vaccine stock has lost some of its mojo. But my purpose here isn't to delve into why Moderna's share price has fallen from its soaring heights. I'd like to focus on the future rather than the past. To me, there's a much more important question to attempt to answer: How low can Moderna stock actually go? Image source: Getty Images. Wall Street's take Wall Street's answer to that question is that Moderna's share price isn't likely to fall at all. The average analysts' price target for the stock is actually slightly higher than the current share price. Keep in mind, though, that there are varied opinions among analysts about Moderna. That average price target of $340 includes a wide range of estimates. One analyst thinks that the stock could hit $490 within the next 12 months. Another believes that Moderna's share price could plunge to $85. Refinitiv's latest survey of 16 analysts found that seven of them still view Moderna stock as a buy or strong buy. Another six analysts have the equivalent of a hold recommendation for the stock. However, three analysts have given Moderna an underperform rating, which could be seen as either a \"weak hold\" or a \"moderate sell\" opinion. The reality is that there isn't a clear consensus on Wall Street about how Moderna's shares will perform. But it's fair to say that the general view appears to be that the stock probably won't slip much more than it already has. A valuation conundrum The main challenge with trying to determine how much lower Moderna stock could go is that there's a valuation conundrum. At first glance, Moderna actually looks quite cheap. Its shares trade at only a little over 11 times expected earnings. So why wouldn't Moderna be a screaming buy with that low valuation? The projected earnings used in the multiple are for 2022. There's a lot of uncertainty about what the company's earnings might be in subsequent years. Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel recently stated in an interview with Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung that life could return to normal in the second half of 2022 . But no one knows for sure what a return to normalcy will mean for sales of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. Perhaps annual boosters will be needed. However, that would mean one shot per person going forward instead of two. I doubt that Moderna will be able to double its vaccine price to fully offset the lower revenue. There's no guarantee, though, that boosters will be required annually. Also, it's entirely possible that governments won't pay for the shots in a post-pandemic world. For example, the U.S. doesn't cover your flu shots every year. The availability of convenient pills that could be used for post-exposure prophylaxis could reduce vaccination rates. In short, there are many variables that make it extremely difficult to peg an accurate valuation to Moderna beyond next year. My prediction I'll make a prediction as to how low Moderna stock might go. But allow me to first give a huge disclaimer: This is only my best guess, and it could be dead wrong. Over the next six to nine months, I tend to agree with many Wall Street analysts that Moderna's share price won't drop much more if at all. As long as there are hopes that Moderna's sales in 2023 and the following years will remain close to current levels, the stock should have a floor that's relatively close to where it's trading now. By late next year, though, my hunch is that we'll begin to see that COVID-19 vaccine sales will slump by quite a bit after the pandemic is over. If I'm right, I suspect that investors will be rattled, resulting in a sell-off of Moderna's shares. How much the stock falls will depend on how lower the company's future sales will be. I wouldn't be surprised by another 30% pullback. However, there could be good news from Moderna's pipeline on the way within the next few years. I'm optimistic about the prospects for the company's cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate, which is about to advance into late-stage clinical studies. Moderna could also use its growing cash stockpile to make acquisitions that give it near-term growth drivers. Basically, I'm neutral on Moderna over the short term, bearish over the midterm, and cautiously bullish over the long term. In the meantime, my view is that there are other stocks that offer better prospects across all three time horizons.",

    "full_description": "AMC Entertainment 's ( NYSE:AMC ) performance in 2021 so far has been nothing short of remarkable, despite there being little about the underlying business to justify such a dramatic move higher. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on Oct. 4 , Fool.com contributors Matt Frankel, Rachel Warren, and Jason Hall discuss why AMC has rallied, the positive developments with the business itself (there are a few), and where the stock could go from here. Matt Frankel: But real quick, and let me give you the rundown of AMC because it's not an entirely terrible story, to be fair. I would actually give their management a pretty high grade in how they've managed the past year or so. Jason Hall: 100%. Frankel: AMC, we all know what they do. I'm not going to waste time telling everyone what AMC does, they're the movie theater operator. They were not in a good place when the pandemic started. Obviously, movie theaters closed at the beginning of the pandemic, they stayed closed for a long time. Theaters are just now starting to ramp up their in-theater release schedules. AMC was drowning in debt, to put it mildly, at the start of the pandemic, and their stock was, I believe $2 a share at one point. AMC is up 1,670% this year. I'm guessing they're the best performer of any company we're talking about. Hall: That's a great 20-year return in nine, 10 months. Frankel: Why have they done so well? It'd be easy if you could just say they're a meme stock and move on. But AMC has attracted the attention of a group of retail investors. Because of that, their stock price is going up. At first, you could attribute it to a short squeeze. AMC really took advantage of the situation and started raising capital at the new higher stock price by selling more shares. They've raised a total of about $2 billion since the pandemic started, about $1.25 billion in the second quarter alone. They have about $2 billion worth of cash on their balance sheet right now. They're starting to put some of that money to work in reducing debt, which is their biggest problem. They just announced they're redeeming $35 million of their highest-interest debt. All of that debt has an interest rate of above 15%, by the way, just to let you know how much of a drag interest is on this company. They started redeeming that, they want to improve their theaters, acquire some more distressed theaters from competitors in the current environment. I give their CEO a big pat on the back, but they really, I don't want to say justify their valuation. I'm not sure that could even happen. To put it in perspective, AMC's market cap is over $19 billion right now. The highest they ever got to before the pandemic in the glory days of the movie business was $4 billion. They are trading at more than roughly five times their highest pre-pandemic valuation. That valuation is really their big competitive advantage if shareholders will let it be. If they could just sell $5 billion worth of shares and extinguished their debt right now, I would be having probably a different conversation. They might have been my sixth-ranked stock instead of my seventh. But shareholders have shut down the CEO's ability to sell any more shares at this point, which I think is ludicrous. I think that valuation is the biggest competitive advantage they have going forward. Not that I really need to put words in your mouth or anything, but why did you guys like this No. 7 [out of seven stocks that have doubled or more this year]? Hall: I'm going to just go real quick here. Forgive me, Rachel, for just jumping in because I have to share this chart. Rachel Warren: No, it's fine. Hall: It's not just market cap, it's enterprise value. If somebody wanted to buy the company, you're going to assume the debt, too. You're not just going to buy the company, you have to take on that debt. Again, this is looking out five years. This is 10 years. This is an incredible valuation. The most important thing to me is to paraphrase one thing that Peter Lynch said: \"You can own the best company in a mediocre industry and you still own a mediocre business.\" That to me sums up entirely AMC. It is a mediocre industry right now. Warren: Yeah, I agree. I have to say, I think that even before the pandemic, you were seeing these major shifts in people going less to movie theaters. Now with so many great streaming services available, and those businesses are growing by leaps and bounds, people like the idea of being able to sit at home in their PJs and turn on their favorite movie, or catch something shortly after it's released on their favorite platform, and they don't have to go to the theater. Then with the pandemic, that of course just heightened that trend. I think it goes back to what you were saying, Jason. I think the business model in and of itself is not what it used to be. Then I think that couples with AMC's current situation and the fact that it can't seem to do anything to raise more capital to tamp down that debt. I just think it's a lose-lose situation.",

Generally speaking, I look for companies with a solid competitive position and good prospects for future growth -- those qualities tend to make a stock unstoppable over the long run. Here are two ideas to get you started. Image source: Getty Images 1. Tesla Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) is the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs). Through the first eight months of 2021, the company held 13.3% market share. And despite significant supply chain headwinds, Tesla managed to produce 237,823 cars in the most recent quarter , up 64% from the prior year. That's impressive, but there is a more important story under the hood; this company is becoming one of the most efficient automakers in the world. In 2017, Tesla introduced the 2170 battery cell, capable of storing 50% more energy than the previous 1865 model. In fact, CEO Elon Musk said it was the \"highest energy density cell in the world, and also the cheapest.\" More importantly, this technology means Tesla pays just $187 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for its battery packs, the most expensive part of an EV. That's 10% less than the next closest competitor, and 24% lower than the industry average. In 2019, Tesla opened the Gigafactory Shanghai, manufacturing the first Model 3 less than 10 months after breaking ground. This helped localize its China business, cutting costs by reducing the number of cars shipped across the ocean on boats. It also boosted Tesla's total production capacity, which now sits at a theoretical 1.05 million EVs per year. Collectively, these moves helped Tesla cut the cost per vehicle from $84,000 in 2017 to $38,000 in the first quarter of 2021. At the same time, the company delivered an industry-leading operating margin of 6.3% in 2020, and that figure has ticked up to 14.6% in the most recent quarter. Not surprisingly, Tesla's financial performance has been impressive. In fact, the company has posted a positive GAAP profit for the last nine consecutive quarters, and its top line is growing quickly. Metric Q3 2019 (TTM) Q3 2021 (TTM) CAGR Revenue $24.4 billion $46.8 billion 38% Free cash flow $873.0 million $4.1 billion 117% Data source: Tesla SEC filings, YCharts. TTM: trailing-12-months. CAGR: compound annual growth rate. Looking ahead, investors should expect this momentum to continue. Tesla recently announced the 4680 battery cell, a new model that will cut costs by 56%, extend range by 54%, and reduce capital expenditures by 69%. The company also plans to open two new factories later this year, further boosting its production capacity. Moreover, Tesla has established itself as a frontrunner in the race to build an autonomous vehicle. In fact, Musk believes the company will have a fully autonomous $25,000 EV on the market within three years. Once that happens, Tesla plans to start an autonomous ride-sharing service, pioneering a market that Ark Invest values at $1.2 trillion by 2030. And Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas believes Tesla could launch a flying car business by 2050, addressing a potential $9 trillion market. In short, Tesla is pushing the boundaries of modern technology . That's why I plan to add to my position during the next market crash. 2. Upstart Holdings Upstart Holdings ( NASDAQ:UPST ) brings big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to the consumer credit industry. Its software platform helps lenders like banks and credit unions quantify risk more precisely. In fact, according to management, Upstart's AI models are four to eight times more accurate than traditional credit scores, allowing lenders to approve nearly three times as many applicants while holding loss rates constant. To that end, Upstart's business model creates a powerful network effect: More borrowers means more data, which translates into better AI models. And better AI models mean more approved loans (without compromising loss rates), which should bring more applicants to Upstart. This virtuous cycle has translated into supercharged growth for the fintech company. Metric Q4 2018 (TTM) Q2 2021 (TTM) CAGR Revenue $99.3 million $452.2 million 83% Free cash flow $49.3 million $215.0 million 80% Data source: Upstart SEC filings, YCharts. TTM: trailing-12-months CAGR: compound annual growth rate. Looking ahead, shareholders have plenty of reasons to be excited. Upstart recently expanded beyond the $84 billion personal loans industry, entering the $635 billion auto loans market. The company is now licensed to refinance auto loans in 47 states, and five banking partners have already adopted the platform for this purpose. Here's the bottom line: Upstart collects nearly 1,600 data points per loan applicant, far more than the 12 to 20 variables considered by a typical FICO scorecard. Over time, that advantage should snowball, improving consumer access to credit and boosting business for Upstart's lending partners. Moreover, Upstart plans to bring its technology to other sectors in the future, including credit cards, mortgages, and student loans, addressing the $4.2 trillion consumer lending industry more broadly. Put simply, the company has a strong competitive position and a sizable market opportunity. That's why I plan to buy this growth stock during the next market crash .",

Brookfield Renewable is not only among the world's renewable-energy producers, but it's also well diversified, with strong presence in hydropower and a growing presence in solar and wind. So what is the company's growth potential? Consider that Brookfield Renewable has roughly 20 gigawatts (GW) of assets under operation currently across four continents, but its development pipeline was already worth 31 GW as of August. Based on that pipeline and its efforts to boost margins, Brookfield Renewable expects to grow its funds from operations (FFO) per share to by 6%-11% organically through 2025. And if it can find lucrative acquisition opportunities along the way, the company could grow FFO by another 9%. So while that growth should reflect in the stock's price, dividend growth should act as a booster: Brookfield Renewable is committed to growing dividends by 5%-9% annually in the long run. With Brookfield Renewable already yielding a strong 3.2% and the stock down sharply this year, you could lock in massive gains over the next 20 years by simply reinvesting dividends that Brookfield Renewable pays you and watching the world transition to clean energy. This stock's an almost surefire long-term winner Mastercard ( NYSE:MA ) is among the world's largest players in payment processing, and although competition is tough, Mastercard is aggressively augmenting its traditional business with new technologies, and that innovation and hunger for growth could mean big things for the company in the coming decades. For instance, with cryptocurrency mania catching on, Mastercard knew it doesn't want to be left out, so it recently acquired CipherTrace, a cryptocurrency intelligence company whose platform helps customers, from financial institutions to regulators, to enhance security and monitor fraud. In another rumor floating in the market, Mastercard is reportedly planning to launch buy-now-pay-later in India, one of the company's key growth markets that still relies heavily on cash. In short, Mastercard doesn't just facilitate payments made using its co-branded credit or debit cards anymore but is evolving into a larger fintech company that's constantly innovating to improve its offerings and make its platform more secure. MA data by YCharts Mastercard's shares have risen rapidly in value in recent years, but that's underpinned by steady growth in revenue and cash flows. Also, Mastercard generates a hefty operating margin north of 50%, and it has also started to pay out larger dividends to shareholders. Although its dividend yield is minuscule, Mastercard is a stock to invest in for growth. As economies around the globe increasingly move from cash to digital payments, Mastercard has everything at its disposal to make the most of the opportunity. This stock may have just started in a trillion-dollar market The Trade Desk ( NASDAQ:TTD ) is yet another stock that has had a pretty dismal year so far, but in a world that's increasingly going digital, The Trade Desk's cloud-based ad-buying platform could mint it boatloads of money in the coming years. The Trade Desk's artificial-intelligence-driven programmatic platform automates ad buying with real-time analytics and allows clients to manage campaigns across various advertising formats and channels, such as display, audio, video, and social, across a variety of devices. Advertising agencies and service providers to advertisers are The Trade Desk's primary customers, and it earns fees from them based on their advertising spending, as well as some revenue from value-added and data services. The Trade Desk's offering has found many takers: It has nearly 875 customers, including some of the world's largest advertising companies, including Publicis Groupe, WPP, and Omnicom. Through the six months ended June 30, 2021, The Trade Desk's revenue grew 67% to nearly $500 million. To put its growth into perspective, consider that the company generated revenue worth $661 million in the full year 2019. Also, The Trade Desk is already profitable. An even more important metric to gauge how The Trade Desk is faring is customer stickiness, or whether existing clients are renewing their contracts that typically have one-year terms. The company passes the test, having reported a customer retention rate of 95% in each of the past three years. The Trade Desk is now looking at large international markets such as China and India for growth -- it launched in India this past June. With India's digital advertising market alone projected to grow tenfold over the next decade, The Trade Desk's total addressable market runs into trillions of dollars already, making it a compelling stock to own for the coming decades.",

If you're willing to take on some risk in pursuit of huge returns, read on for a look at fast-growing companies that are worth building positions in right now. Image source: Getty Images Unity Software Interactive content can keep audiences engaged in an era where there are more distractions than ever before. Sure, movies and television series aren't going anywhere, but there's a good case to be made that video games are a more attractive medium for growth-focused investors. Unity Software ( NYSE:U ) is a company that provides a development engine, visual assets, and support services that make it easy for users to create digital experiences. With a proven suite of development tools and expanding offerings designed to meet emerging needs, the business is primed to benefit from surging demand for interactive content. Sales climbed 48% year over year in the second quarter, and the business is likely on track to continue growing at a rapid clip. The company posted a dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 142% in the second quarter, which means that existing customers using Unity's services spent 42% more than they did in the prior-year period. With Unity bringing more customers on board and existing clients increasing their spending, the business is primed for more explosive sales growth. Even better, Unity Software is posting very strong gross margins, which came in at a whopping 80% across the first half of the year. The combination of big sales growth and stellar gross margins suggests that the company should be able to shift into delivering consistent profitability and big earnings growth, and investors who take a buy-and-hold approach could wind up seeing fantastic returns from the stock. Airbnb With travel restrictions still in effect and lingering pandemic conditions dampening consumer enthusiasm, it's a testament to the strength of Airbnb 's ( NASDAQ:ABNB ) business that the company appears to be on track to post best-ever quarterly performance when it reports Q3 results in November. The travel and hospitality industries now appear to be making some encouraging recovery strides, and Airbnb's impressive performance despite recent challenges points toward a promising outlook. In addition to quadrupling year-over-year sales last quarter, the short-term vacation rental company managed to boost revenue 10% compared with the prepandemic Q2 sales it posted in 2019. Now, Airbnb is ready to start setting sales records again. Strong Q3 results could power the company's share price significantly higher, and the company's long-term growth potential is enticing. Despite already having a market capitalization of roughly $108 billion, the company is likely still in the early stages of tapping into an incredible addressable market. Airbnb has more listings than ever, and its competitive advantage in the short-term rental bookings market should continue to expand as more hosts join the platform. A growing number of hosts should help attract a growing number of guests, and vice versa. Through hard times, Airbnb has proven that it's a great company with a highly flexible business model. As near-term challenges ease, there's a good chance that the rental leader's business will post eye-catching rebound performance, and it's not too late for investors to get in on this potentially world-beating winner. Fiverr International Despite its very impressive sales growth, it's been an up-and-down year for Fiverr International ( NYSE:FVRR ) shareholders. FVRR data by YCharts The stock's last big sell-off came on the heels of otherwise stellar second-quarter results. The problem? Fiverr's 60% year-over-year sales growth in the period was paired with more muted guidance for the Q3 and full-year periods. With its last update, the gig-marketplace specialist guided for midpoint sales growth of 34% in the third quarter and 50% annually for fiscal 2021. Those targets might look pretty fantastic under other circumstances, but the market had priced in even better momentum, and appetite for growth-dependent tech plays has frequently wavered across this year's trading. For risk-tolerant investors willing to weather potential volatility, I think Fiverr still offers plenty of upside at current prices. The stock trades down roughly 43% from its high, and it's not unreasonable to think that the company's valuation could bounce back and go on to reach new heights. The evolution of the gig economy is still in early innings, and there's still plenty of opportunity to capitalize. Fiverr is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 10, and the market will likely be looking for the company to top its potentially conservative growth estimates. Without too much focus on how the Q3 numbers come in, I expect that long-term investors will see strong performance from the stock and think the company has plenty of room to grow from its current market capitalization of roughly $7 billion. The gig economy looks poised for big growth over the long term, and Fiverr International has positioned itself as a leading player in the space.",

    "full_description": "Social Security is likely to be critical to your financial security in retirement. How critical? Well, consider that it supplies about 30% or more of elderly Americans' retirement income, with 37% of men and 42% of women getting 50% or more of their income. Thus, the more you can get from the program, the better -- and recently, the maximum monthly benefit was $3,895 -- or about $46,740 annually. That might sound pretty good, but read on -- because there's a good chance you won't be collecting that much. Image source: Getty Images. Social Security benefits Let's start with a little perspective. Recently, the average monthly Social Security benefit was $1,559 -- or about $18,700 per year. Clearly, it will be hard for anyone to live well on just that -- indeed, it's not that far from the poverty level, which was $12,880 for an individual as of 2021. That's the average, though -- and if you earned more than average over the course of your working life, your benefits will be above average, too. But they will never top $3,895 per month (as of 2021). (By the way, take a moment to appreciate that since $1,559 is the average, many millions are collecting less -- often a lot less.) To get an idea of how much Social Security income you have coming to you, head over to the Social Security Administration (SSA) website, and set up a \" my Social Security \" account. Once you've done so, you can pop in any time to see the latest estimates of your future benefits, based on the latest earnings information the SSA has. (You might also spot an error or two -- if so, fixing them can boost your future earnings.) Qualifying for the maximum benefit So who receives the maximum benefit, and how do they qualify for it? Well, you'd have had to earn the maximum earnings allowable during your working life, and you'd have to have delayed starting to collect your benefits until age 70. Maximum earnings don't mean Bill Gates- or Warren Buffett-like incomes. For every year there's an earnings cap beyond which we're not taxed on our earnings for Social Security. For 2021, that limit is $142,800. So you'd need to have maxed out earnings in all your earning years that are included in the calculation. Here's why age 70 matters: Each of us has a \" full retirement age \" at which we can start collecting the full benefits to which we're entitled, based on our earnings -- and for most of us, it's 66 or 67. But you can start collecting as early as age 62 and as late as age 70, with your benefit checks shrinking if you start early and getting bigger if you delay. (Of course, starting early means you'll get many more checks, so this isn't quite as big a deal as it may seem.) For that maximum benefit, you'll have to delay starting to collect until age 70 -- something that's hard for many retirees who need the income sooner. Here's a look at the benefits a maximum earner would receive, according to the SSA: The maximum benefit depends on the age you retire. For example, if you retire at full retirement age in 2021, your maximum benefit would be $3,148. However, if you retire at age 62 in 2021, your maximum benefit would be $2,324. If you retire at age 70 in 2021, your maximum benefit would be $3,895. Image source: Getty Images. Increase your Social Security benefits If you're starting to realize that the $3,895 is probably out of your grasp, know that there are still ways to increase the Social Security benefits you'll get. For example, make sure you work at least 35 years, as the benefits are calculated based on the 35 years in which you earned the most (adjusted for inflation). So if you're planning to retire after working just 30 years, know that the formula will be incorporating five zeroes for five years. Working a few more years can boost your benefit -- especially if (on an inflation-adjusted basis) you're earning more now than ever. Beefing up your income for a few years can also work, and you might accomplish that by taking on a side gig, such as walking dogs, teaching music or a language, making and selling things online, or doing freelance writing, editing, photography, or web design, among many other options. So don't fret if you're not going to get the maximum payout (although some of you will get it!). Instead, do what you can to simply maximize the payout that you do ultimately receive. Spending a little time reading up on Social Security can pay off if it helps you get more out of the vital program.",

If SpaceX keeps growing at this rate, the company could achieve a $1 trillion valuation before the end of the decade. (By the way, there's still just one way to invest in SpaceX .) Image source: Getty Images. When SpaceX reached its $100 billion valuation As CNBC reports, SpaceX insiders have agreed to sell \"up to $755 million\" worth of their stock to outside investors at $560 a share in a private stock sale. At that price, all shares currently (privately) outstanding at the company would add up to a combined value of $100.3 billion. That's 33.3% more than SpaceX shares commanded as recently as February, in the company's last reported stock sale. (Curiously, the February stock sales saw SpaceX raise $1.2 billion for itself by selling new shares, even as insiders cashed out $750 million in shares through a secondary sale of stock. This month, the stock won a higher valuation despite raising no new capital for itself.) Nevertheless, as a result of this latest stock transaction, SpaceX has catapulted to \"centicorn\" status, making it one of only two privately-owned companies in the world valued above $100 billion. The world's only other centicorn, by the way, is China's Bytedance -- the owner of TikTok. How SpaceX reached its $100 billion valuation SpaceX achieved this incredible valuation on the back of two developments in particular: Starlink , a system for providing broadband internet to Earth via a constellation of 1,700-odd satellites (and counting); and Starship , an experimental, reusable spacecraft-and-launch booster system that is expected to lift payloads of 100 metric tons or more to orbit once operational. SpaceX believes that these two systems -- with the help of a little incremental revenue from Falcon 9 satellite launches and the occasional space tourism flight -- will generate as much as $36 billion in sales for SpaceX by 2025. Personally, I have my doubts about that number. But honestly, until SpaceX bows to investor demand and offers its stock for IPO , SpaceX's revenue and even profit numbers will remain of only tangential interest to investors. What's more important is the effect that SpaceX's business success will have on the stock prices of its competitors -- in particular, space companies such as Lockheed Martin ( NYSE:LMT ) and Boeing ( NYSE:BA ) . What SpaceX's $100 billion valuation means for Lockheed Martin and Boeing investors According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , Lockheed Martin's space business, most of which is tied up in its United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture with Boeing, contributed $12.25 billion in revenue to the defense industry giant. Boeing, in contrast, doesn't break out the numbers for its space business solo, instead wrapping them up with defense and security revenue in its Boeing Defense, Space & Security division (BDS). Still, if we assume that as 50-50 partners in ULA, Boeing's space business is of a similar size to Lockheed's, we can estimate the combined value of the two companies' space revenues at about $24.5 billion. Granted, that figure is more than NASA's entire fiscal 2021 budget of $23.3 billion. But Boeing, Lockheed, and Boeing-and-Lockheed-as-ULA also get a lot of money from Pentagon defense contracts for space work that aren't included in NASA's budget. Boeing and Lockheed's space businesses are also growing. For example, Lockheed's space revenue grew about 26% from 2016 through 2020, and Boeing's combined BDS business grew 30%. In contrast, it's hard to know how much SpaceX has grown over the same timespan -- as a private company, it's not obligated to show its math. But based on internal SpaceX projections obtained by The Wall Street Journal some years ago, SpaceX anticipated growing its own revenue by more than 200% over the 2016-2020 time period. And if the company continues growing according to those projections, revenue could more than quintuple over the next five years. If things continue going as they have been, therefore, by 2025, SpaceX's anticipated $36 billion in revenue will probably eclipse Boeing's and Lockheed's combined $32 billion that year (even assuming a generous 30% growth rate for the latter). Moreover, investors shouldn't rule out the possibility that SpaceX's momentous growth will come at the expense of Boeing and Lockheed, such that the faster SpaceX grows, the slower its competitors will. In short, the future for SpaceX is looking very bright indeed. The future for Boeing and Lockheed Martin in space -- not so much .",

It can also mess up your long-term goals and threaten your future financial security. But this doesn't have to happen. If you take the following steps, you should be able to weather a market crash without too much difficulty. Ensure you're diversified Lack of diversification is a legitimate reason to be concerned about a potential market crash. If you only have your money in a handful of stocks, there's a higher probability of significant loss, especially if all your stocks are in a single market sector. Image source: Getty Images. Ideally, you should have your money in at least 25 different stocks, and these stocks should be in a few different sectors. This ensures that all your assets don't take a hit if a major issue affects a single industry. If you don't feel comfortable picking stocks, you can always opt for an index fund instead. These are bundles of stocks you buy together, and they're designed to mimic a market index . They're some of the cheapest investments out there and they instantly diversify your money among hundreds of companies. This makes them a popular option for beginning and experienced investors alike. Remind yourself of your long-term goals Short-term losses can be stressful, and they can make some investors think that they're doing something wrong. But the truth is, ups and downs are a natural part of investing. Even the best investors lose money sometimes, but they know when to sell and when to stay the course. If you have a diversified portfolio and you feel confident that you've chosen strong companies that will still be profitable in a few decades, often the best thing for you to do in a market crash is nothing. Remind yourself that you're investing for the long term and these short-term fluctuations don't mean that much in the scheme of things. If it helps, avoid checking your portfolio more than once or twice per year. For some people, checking it more often than this can tempt them to make emotional decisions that end up costing them in the long run. Use dollar-cost averaging Dollar-cost averaging is an investing strategy where you invest a regular sum of money on a schedule. For example, you might invest $100 every week or $500 every month. You decide what works the best for you. The point is, it's automated. Once you have a schedule set up, you don't have to think about it or even check your portfolio. This is the strategy you use with your 401(k) , whether you know it or not. Your employer withholds a specified amount of money from your paycheck and deposits it into your 401(k) where it's invested in the securities you've chosen. You can do the same thing with other investment accounts too. Many enable you to link a bank account so funds are automatically transferred on a specific schedule. Check with your account provider if you're unsure how to set this up. This hands-off investing approach is a great choice for those worried about a market crash because you don't have to try to time the market. Sometimes, you'll invest when prices are high and you won't be able to buy as many shares. But other times, you'll invest when prices are low and you'll get more shares. In the end, it'll all balance out and you'll end up paying a fair price for your shares. Another advantage to dollar-cost averaging is that you don't have to worry about forgetting to invest. Once you've got your automatic deposits set up, you don't have to do anything else. Just make sure the transfers are set to take place when you have adequate funds in your bank account, like right after you get paid, to avoid an overdraft. There isn't anything you can do to make yourself impervious to market crashes, but if you follow the three steps above, you shouldn't have too much to fear from them. Just stick to your plan and know that the market will recover eventually.",

    "content": "The federal government’s mantra of “technology, not taxes” has left it with few options to easily reduce carbon emissions. In many sectors of the economy, it’s a recipe for disaster — a vague slogan that keeps us waiting. But for all its flaws, relying on technology points us in the right direction in at least one field — reducing emissions from cars. Light vehicles are responsible for 11% of Australia’s carbon emissions. As it stands, Australia is way behind the pack. The lowest-emitting variants of the top-selling models in Australia are more emissions-intensive than the models available overseas. The average US passenger light vehicle is more than 100kg heavier than the average Australian light vehicle and has 30kW more power. Yet on average US vehicles emit 5 grams less carbon dioxide per kilometre travelled. Emissions ceilings are common worldwide A new Grattan Institute report recommends Australia quickly move to catch up to mainstream international practice. Eighty per cent of the world imposes a carbon dioxide emissions standard, or ceiling, on new light vehicles, applied across the offering of each manufacturer. The US, the UK and Europe all have ceilings that tighten over time, bringing down average emissions. If manufacturers breach the ceiling, they face fines. Read more: Top economists call for measures to speed the switch to electric cars Australia has no such standard, although it regulates other pollutants including nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions, but to a weaker standard than much of the rest of the world because our petrol is of poorer quality. Laboratory tests in 2015 found the average new vehicle sold in Australia emitted 184 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre driven. More than five years on, little has changed – in 2020 the average new vehicle sold emitted 180 grams per kilometre driven. That’s much higher than in comparable countries. New passenger cars sold in Germany, for example, are similar to Australia’s in weight, yet emit significantly less carbon dioxide per kilometre. Plenty of excuses are offered for Australia’s poor performance when it comes to vehicle carbon dioxide emissions; among them the fact that we drive large cars and that the quality of our petrol is poor. But our bigger problem is the absence of a carbon dioxide emissions ceiling. We are not proposing a tax. A carbon dioxide emissions ceiling comes as close as possible to mandating better technology while sticking to the Government’s pledge of not telling people “what cars to drive”. A ceiling is not a tax The ceiling should come into force no later than 2024 at 143 grams of carbon per kilometre (g/km). It would tighten to 100g/km by 2027 and 25g/km by 2030. Carbon emissions from new vehicles under the ceiling would fall to zero by 2035. To ensure it works Australia should adopt the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure and new vehicles sold should include on-board vehicle emissions monitors by 2024, with de-identified data released publicly. Read more: Going electric could be Australia’s next big light bulb moment The change could save almost 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2060. By 2030, the savings would make up at least 40% of what’s needed to reach Australia’s 26% cut in emissions target — which would be a good start to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. It would save drivers money The change would leave drivers better off financially. It would probably increase the price of new vehicles slightly, but make them cheaper to run. The average Australian driver would save almost A$1,000 within five years of buying a new car. It wouldn’t mean the end of the weekend. But it would change the balance of options available. There would be more low-emissions and zero-emissions vehicles, and a smaller offering of higher-emitting vehicles. In the leadup to 2035 as more people switched to electric vehicles, there would be space under the ceiling for manufacturers to sell higher-emitting varieties to those who need or prefer them. Read more: China is on course to build the best cars in the world In the UK, where there is a strong ceiling, consumers can choose from about 130 electric vehicle models across a range of prices. Here, there are just 31 models available, few affordable to everyday Australians. What we are proposing is a meaningful step towards net-zero at negligible cost to taxpayers.

It makes sense that many investors could be apprehensive about buying stocks. Even legendary investor Warren Buffett isn't buying many stocks these days. However, there are still plenty of stocks that are smart long-term picks. Here are three growth stocks to buy right now without any hesitation. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Brookfield Renewable Pretty much any time is a great time to buy shares of a leader in an unstoppable growth market. That's especially the case, though, when the stock is well below its year-to-date high. I think Brookfield Renewable ( NYSE:BEP ) ( NYSE:BEPC ) truly is a stock you can buy with no trepidation because it checks off all of these boxes. Actually, there are two stocks to choose from -- Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) and Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC). The former is a limited partnership (LP). The latter has a corporate structure that allows investors to avoid the tax hassles associated with LPs. Both, though, have the same underlying business. Brookfield Renewable ranks as a global leader in renewable energy. The company operates close to 6,000 generating facilities that combined produce 20 gigawatts of power. It plans to dramatically expand its total capacity with a development pipeline of more than 31 gigawatts. Most major economic powers plus many large corporations have committed to slashing carbon emissions over the next three decades. Roughly 75% of these emissions come from energy and power generation. That means demand for renewable energy must increase significantly for the carbon reduction goals to be achieved. Brookfield Renewable, therefore, has a clear path to growth for years to come. 2. Fiverr The core arguments for buying Brookfield Renewable also apply to Fiverr ( NYSE:FVRR ) . Both stocks are well off their highs. Like Brookfield Renewable, Fiverr is a leader in an unstoppable growth market. That market, in this case, is freelancing. Fiverr's platform connects freelancers with businesses needing digital services. These services include accounting, copywriting, graphic design, programming, and a lot more. If it can be done digitally, there's a potential market for it on Fiverr. The company's secret sauce is that it removes the friction in the freelancing process. Buyers of digital services get transparency with a predefined price and scope of work. Freelancers don't have to bid for jobs or negotiate. Fiverr's valuation could give some investors pause. Its shares trade at a staggering 1,670 times expected earnings. While the stock might look absurdly overvalued , though, it really isn't. Fiverr is targeting an annual addressable U.S. market of $115 billion, but its market cap is only around $7 billion. Work dynamics are changing rapidly -- and Fiverr is well-positioned to lead the way. 3. Innovative Industrial Properties Often the best stocks to buy are those that have simple business models with growth attainable by doing more of what has already been done. Innovative Industrial Properties ( NYSE:IIPR ) stands out as a great example, in my view. IIP is a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) that focuses on the regulated U.S. cannabis industry. Its share price has skyrocketed close to 1,250% over the last five years. This growth was achieved by IIP buying properties from cannabis operators and leasing those properties back to the operators. The company currently owns 76 properties in 19 states. All of these properties are fully leased out with a weighted-average remaining lease term of nearly 17 years. IIP uses this steady cash flow to invest in buying additional properties. I like to call this a \"rinse-and-repeat\" type of business. Whatever your view about legalized cannabis, it's almost assuredly here to stay. And the industry is also likely to grow even more. Many state cannabis markets are only in their early stages. More states could legalize cannabis in the not-too-distant future. Investing in IIP is a great way to profit from this growth.",

    "full_description": "For long-term investors, a key to success is knowing how to take the good days with the bad. In this video clip from \"The 5,\" recorded on Sept. 24 , Fool.com contributors Brian Withers, Demitri Kalogeropoulos, Neil Patel, and Jason Hall share their strategies for thinking about their own portfolios when the market is down. Brian Withers: The S&P over the last decade up 380 percent. Really stellar, no matter how the market did today over the last 10 years, it's done super well. Demitri and Neil are going to stay on and Jason adds to the fun. I'm going to start out with the lead here yesterday, and I love how the financial media does this, yesterday was the best day for the S&P 500 since July. Well, OK. [laughs] The market was up 1.2 percent, the S&P 500 was up 1.2 percent. But today I looked at it, it was floating around zero. But tech stocks and some of our Fool favorites seem to be taking it on the chin over the past week or so. A number of days, I would open my portfolio and I would see nothing but stocks in red numbers. At least for the daily change, not for the long term, but for the daily. I'm wondering if some of our members are feeling this too. The question for you guys is, are you seeing similar trends? How do you deal with it on days or stretches of days where you're seeing red numbers, do you worry? How do you deal with the volatility? Demitri, we'll hit you up first. Demitri Kalogeropoulos: Sure, yeah. It's a great question. I'll start off by saying down days are not as fun [laughs] as the up days for sure. It's just psychology. I guess I think of it this way that volatility is the price we pay for superior returns. It's the price of admission. S&P 500 has averaged, I was looking at an article actually written by Jason Hall that highlighted a few of these numbers, it's up about 14 percent annually over the last decade. They call that the average return over the last 10 years, which is way better obviously when you could get in your bank account or in CDs, or bonds, or real estate in most cases. But to get those better returns, I think we've had to sit through a lot of painful dips, and sometimes those last for weeks, like they did last year, sometimes they last four months, sometimes they last for a year. Even in this unusually great 10-year stretch, out of those 10 calendar years, we had three of those years, we were below that 14 percent average, and three were below five percent. Then, of course, like I said, if we zoom in a little bit, we've also had to sit through that, I think the S&P dove about 20 percent in just a couple of days in the first phase of the pandemic. As an investor, I think about what I'm signing up for. Basically, I'm signing up for that volatility that's at least as bad as the index, but probably a bit worse because I own a lot of individual stocks were just talking about that. Individual stocks, by definition, are going to move more than the market itself, so I have a very real chance. This is the contract, basically. I have a good chance of losing money over the short-term in say, a year or two, and that's short-term. But I have really good odds of earning solid returns over three years, five years, 10 years. I don't think we've ever had a 10-year period of losses. Another great reason why you shouldn't really put money into the market that you are going to need in the next six months or the next year it's this is money for three years, five years, 10 years, 20 years retirement stuff. If you take that approach, the six-month decline is not going to bother you as much. Neil Patel: Yeah, I agree with a lot of what Demitri said. To echo what he just said, volatility, that's the admission to get market-beating returns. You have to be able to stomach the day-to-day, the month-to-month, even the year-to-year ups and downs. Something that I do, I don't really check my positions first thing in the morning or whatever. I look at them once throughout the day and I think that shields me from overreacting to any bad news that's going on. One Ben Graham quote that I really like, for those not familiar, he was just called the father of value in investing and was Warren Buffett's teacher, I think at Columbia. He says in the short-term, the market's a voting machine and in the long-term, it's a weighing machine. Brian, like you said, I think it's funny when news outlets, they'll say, the markets had its best day since it rained on a Tuesday last year or something [laughs] like that. Kalogeropoulos: Right. Patel: I think the thing that keeps me levelheaded, especially when there's a 24-7 news cycle of these days. It's just knowing that the fact that you're investing in the stock market is a good sign. This is the best long-term generational wealth-building tool we have. You're not going to make money selling in and out frequently, it's to stick with it long term. Stocks are going to do what they do day-to-day, week-to-week. It's just focusing on the long-term, focusing on what your goals are. Staying away from the noise, that will help you achieve your returns that you're trying to look for. Jason Hall: Yeah, my portfolio has become very uncorrelant, but it's certainly far more volatile than the market. Today, my portfolio fell 0.6 percent, which is a pretty significant decline, particularly on a day when the market was relatively flattish. I didn't look at it exactly at close. But then the flip side of that is, I've absolutely out-performed the market over the long-term and by a pretty significant margin, even with a large, broad portfolio, which I think is interesting because it's actually part of how I get through these periods of volatility is unlike Brian and Demitri. I'm not sure about use for us how concentrated your portfolio is, but for me, I feel pretty confident that I could own maybe even 200 individual stocks and still outperform the market and not be concerned that I'm potentially watering down my returns because one thing I just think about the Foolish universe. There are several hundred stocks that have been recommended across various portfolios and various stock-picking services at The Motley Fool and the results don't lie, you look at the numbers. That helps me. I think that's so pretty concentrated compared to the thousands of stocks that we have available to buy. Here's the big realization I have come to, and this is recently. I think about the market each day. Whatever moves it makes is what other people are deciding to do with their money. Demitri, you talked about stocks is being great 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 years out, is those things. I'm not going to make my decisions about my money, my stocks based on what other people are deciding to do with their money. That's [laughs] not a very good way to manage your money. For me, I think about it that way. It's also a good way I think, to have the right framework in mind for that near-term money. [laughs] It's right there in the volatility, don't have it in stocks. That helps me just thinking about it that way. Patel: Yeah, Jason. Just to quickly add like you talked about. Investing, I look at it like an arena or a football field where everybody's in the same arena but everyone is playing a different game. You can't judge somebody who's selling a stock or buying a stock, their time horizon might be the end of the day, and they're getting out of the stock or buying or whatever. Like you said, the biggest thing is to just know what your goals are and don't be influenced by the outside people, because that's very easy to do with human behavior and herd mentality and that kind of thing. Hall: Yeah, I love that. Kalogeropoulos: That's a good point. I would just add one thing to also on this topic. If my portfolio drops two percent and I lose sleep over that, that's good information for me to have. Because it's telling me I'm probably too expose personally, that's not a thing. If I'm losing sleep per weeks or worried about what's going to happen if the market drops four percent or five percent, I guess potentially I'm exposing myself to something I'm not comfortable with. Personally, I feel like I have a long investing horizon, so three percent, five percent, those numbers don't freak me out. But it is good information to know. If that continues to happen to you, if you're experiencing that stressful anxiety over a couple of percentage points, maybe you need to think about diversifying a bit more and maybe you want to buy some more index funds or exposure that way. Yeah, exactly. [laughs] Withers: Yeah, Jason, you mentioned yours was down what? A half percent? Hall: Point six. Withers: Point six? Hall: Yeah. Withers: I can double that. I'm down with 1.1 percent today. Hall: [laughs] I beat you. Withers: Well, I am not surprised. Hall: Well, right. You understand the nature of what you own, right? Withers: Right. I imagine on down tech days, I'm going to be down, way more than you.",

And next year's orders and options total about the same. All looks good for more short-term growth in this stock. But what about farther down the road? Could Moderna shares actually help you retire a millionaire? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. From pandemic to endemic? First, let's talk about the coming year or so. Right now, U.S. coronavirus cases are on the decline. But cases in other areas -- such as Europe -- are rising again. We don't yet know when the coronavirus may transition from pandemic to endemic. Once the virus is endemic, it will be around on a regular basis -- but won't attain the same massive rates of infection worldwide all at once. In any case, experts have predicted the coronavirus will stick around. And that means we'll need vaccination. If countries aim to protect their populations, they will have to order vaccines. So Moderna's coronavirus vaccine could remain a billion-dollar product for quite some time. Meanwhile, Moderna is expanding its coronavirus offerings. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month authorized Moderna's half-dose booster. And Moderna is testing three strain-specific booster candidates in phase 2 trials and a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate in phase 1. The company also is conducting preclinical tests on a combined coronavirus/flu vaccine candidate. These programs may not make it to market during the pandemic. But they could ensure Moderna more coronavirus program revenue in the years to come. At that point, countries will be looking for a fine-tuned product: such as a combined vaccine or one targeting variants. And as we can see, Moderna has a lot going on in that department. Beyond the coronavirus program Looking beyond the coronavirus program, Moderna has many other possibilities for revenue and share growth in the future. Certain could be gamechangers and bring in billions. I'm thinking specifically of the company's cytomegalovirus (CMV) and HIV vaccine programs. Moderna expects to launch a phase 3 trial of its investigational CMV vaccine this year. A potential product could bring in between $2 billion and $5 billion annually, Moderna predicts. CMV is a common virus that is most dangerous for unborn babies and people with weakened immune systems. HIV has been elusive for vaccine developers. But Moderna hopes to score a win with its mRNA technology. Moderna uses mRNA to instruct the body to produce proteins to prevent or treat disease. If Moderna's efforts in HIV are successful, it could be a gamechanger. Moderna aims to launch phase 1 trials for two HIV vaccine candidates this year. The biotech company's coronavirus vaccine has demonstrated mRNA technology works. So, there's reason to be optimistic that Moderna may bring other mRNA products to market in the coming years. It's true that Moderna's shares have soared since it entered the coronavirus vaccine race. But revenue and profit have followed. MRNA Net Income (Quarterly) data by YCharts And other measures of financial health such as return on invested capital , free cash flow , and cash levels are reason to be positive about the company's future. MRNA Free Cash Flow data by YCharts A long-term investment These financial measures along with Moderna's pipeline of 37 programs make it a good choice for a long-term investment. So, can Moderna help you retire a millionaire? It depends on your investment horizon. Moderna shares may not continue to gain at the current pace forever. But over time, sales of coronavirus products, advancement of candidates through the pipeline, and potentially commercialization of other products likely will lead the shares higher. Of course, as with any biotech stock, the risk is failure of a candidate in clinical trials -- or a drop in sales of a blockbuster product . Investing always involves some degree of risk. But, overall, the future looks bright for Moderna. So, if you buy Moderna now and hold for a number of years, I expect this biotech stock could help you on your quest to wealth.",

Only a small part of the distribution is fixed. Most of its dividend is variable based on a 50% payout of excess free cash flow. It's possible that your annual income could be lower in the future than it would be now. However, Devon's near-term future looks great. The market appears to be in the early stages of another energy upcycle. The company's assets should deliver strong free cash flow with oil prices higher than they've been in recent years. You can also rest assured that Devon is committed to its dividend program. The company has paid dividends for 28 consecutive years. It has also increased its dividend payout by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10% since 1993. 2. Enterprise Products Partners Enterprise Products Partners ( NYSE:EPD ) doesn't have any catches with its dividend. The midstream energy company's dividend yield currently stands at 7.3%. If you used another third of your $100,000 to buy shares of Enterprise, you'd receive income of roughly $2,440 per year. Like Devon, Enterprise Products Partners places a high priority on its dividend program. The company has increased its distribution for 22 years in a row. The dividend CAGR during that period is around 7%. You just might get impressive share appreciation along with the nice income by investing in Enterprise. Wall Street analysts think the stock could jump more than 15% over the next 12 months. What about the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources? That's almost certainly an unstoppable trend. However, Enterprise's management believes that the lower-emission natural gas, natural gas liquids, and lower-sulfur crude oil that are at the core of its business will remain a key source for energy production for a long time to come. The company's dividend payments shouldn't face serious threats of disruption anytime soon. 3. GlaxoSmithKline If you've been adding the numbers, we're up to $5,770 per year with Devon's and Enterprise's dividends. Investing the remaining amount of your $100,000 in GlaxoSmithKline ( NYSE:GSK ) will provide nearly $1,900 and get your total annual income from these stocks to close to $7,700. Wall Street is especially bullish about GlaxoSmithKline. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of around 20%. Analysts' optimism centers in large part on GlaxoSmithKline's HIV drugs, which continue to deliver strong sales growth. The drugmaker also has rising stars including respiratory therapies Nucala and Trelegy Ellipta, lupus drug Benlysta, and cancer drug Zejula. There's one thing to keep in mind with GlaxoSmithKline, though. The company plans to spin off its consumer healthcare unit next year (or, based on recent rumors, sell it to a private equity firm). With this move, GlaxoSmithKline will likely reduce its dividend by around 31%. That would cut your annual dividends from these three stocks to close to $7,000. I suspect most retired investors would still be happy with that level of supplemental income.",

For instance, despite the benchmark S&P 500 losing a third of its value in about a month during the first quarter of 2020, the widely followed index has since doubled. Buying stakes in great companies and allowing your investment thesis to play out over time has always been a strategy that's produced a high success rate. The big question isn't whether you should buy stocks, but rather, \"Which stocks to buy?\" Image source: Getty Images. For more than a decade, growth stocks have been in favor on Wall Street. Historically low lending rates and ongoing quantitative easing measures from the nation's central bank have rolled out the red carpet for fast-growing businesses. But ignoring the upside potential for dividend stocks would be a big mistake. To begin with, dividend stocks have a much better long-term track record than companies that don't pay a dividend. A report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management, a division of JPMorgan Chase , found an almost 500% higher annualized return from companies that initiated and grew their payouts between 1972 and 2012 (9.5% annual return), relative to stocks which didn't pay a dividend over the same four-decade stretch (1.6% annual return). Companies that pay a regular dividend also tend to be time-tested, are profitable on a recurring basis, and generally have transparent outlooks. While income traps do exist, a majority of dividend companies are stable and allow shareholders to sleep easy at night. What income stocks aren't known for is their growth potential -- but that doesn't mean growth-oriented dividend stocks don't exist. If you were to invest $300,000 in the following trio of dividend stocks and leave that investment untouched for 10 years, you could be a millionaire by 2031, or sooner. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom: 2.8% yield Tech stocks are known for their high-growth potential, but they typically don't pay out beefy dividends. With semiconductors solutions company Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) , investors are getting the best of both worlds . Easily the biggest catalyst for Broadcom is the ongoing rollout of 5G wireless infrastructure. It's been about a decade since wireless companies dramatically improved download speeds. As 5G becomes accessible for a larger number of cities, we're liable to see consumers and businesses jump at the chance to upgrade their wireless devices to take advantage of these faster download speeds. Broadcom generates most of its revenue from 5G wireless chips used in next-generation smartphones, as well as other internal accessories. Since this device upgrade cycle won't happen overnight, Broadcom should see steady organic growth for years to come. There's also plenty of potential from its smaller but faster-growing ancillary operating segments. For example, with the pandemic encouraging businesses of all sizes to create an online presence and move their data into the cloud, data center demand is on the rise. Broadcom is a key provider of connectivity and access chips for data centers. On the industrial side of the equation, Broadcom should continue to benefit from strong new vehicle demand. Broadcom's solutions are used in automotive infotainment systems, in select drivetrain components, and even in driver assist technology. All told, the company pointed out in March that around 90% of its chip capacity for 2021 was already booked . This exceptionally strong demand for semiconductor solutions is likely to carry forward for years to come. When coupled with a quarterly payout that's grown by more than 5,000% over the past 11 years, you have a recipe for serious wealth creation. Image source: Getty Images. Innovative Industrial Properties: 2.4% yield If you want to own something truly unique, find yourself a high-growth marijuana stock that pays an above-average dividend. That's precisely what investors will get with cannabis-focused real estate investment trust, Innovative Industrial Properties ( NYSE:IIPR ) . Innovative Industrial Properties, or IIP for short, seeks to acquire medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities that can then be leased for long periods of time. As of mid-October, IIP owned 76 properties in 19 states that spanned a total of 7.5 million rentable square feet. The most important figure here is that 100% of this square footage was leased , with a weighted-average remaining lease length of 16.7 years. Even though the company generates the bulk of its growth from acquiring new properties, it's worth noting that IIP does have a modest organic growth component built in. Every year, it passes along an inflationary rental hike to its tenants. Additionally, it collects a 1.5% property management fee, which is based on the annual rental rate. For the moment, Innovative Industrial Properties' secret weapon is its sale-leaseback agreements . Since cannabis is a federally illicit substance, marijuana companies often run into problems accessing basic financial services from banks and credit unions. IIP's solution to this is to purchase cultivation or processing facilities from pot companies with cash. It then leases the property back to the seller for an extended period of time. Even if the federal government were to reform marijuana at the federal level and access to basic banking services were to open up, IIP would continue to benefit from its long-established relationships in the marijuana industry. Further, not all pot companies will qualify for traditional bank loans, which'll keep IIP busy. With IIP's quarterly payout growing tenfold in four years, it looks to be well on its way to making patient investors rich. Image source: Visa. Visa: 0.6% yield A third dividend stock with the potential to turn $300,000 into $1 million by 2031, or potentially sooner, is payment-processing kingpin Visa ( NYSE:V ) . The best thing about Visa is its cyclical ties . Downturns and recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle. But the thing about recessions is they usually only last a few months to a couple of quarters. By comparison, periods of economic expansion are measured in years. While Visa does experience spending weakness from consumers and businesses during recessions, this weakness is more than outweighed by the disproportionate amount of time the U.S. and global economy are expanding. It definitely doesn't hurt that Visa is the leader in U.S. credit card network purchase volume . The U.S. is the leading market for consumption in the world, and Visa held a more than 30-percentage-point advantage over the next-closest domestic competitor in 2018. Another advantage for Visa is that it's not a lender . Unlike some of its peers, Visa strictly sticks to payment processing. Though it is giving up the potential to generate fee and interest income during those long periods of economic expansion, Visa is also ensuring that it doesn't have to set cash aside to cover inevitable credit loan delinquencies during contractions or recessions. Playing it safe is what allows Visa to generate consistent profit margins of 50% or higher. Don't forget about Visa's international opportunity, either. It's expanded via acquisition (e.g., the buyout of Visa Europe in 2016), and has ample runway to build a presence in underbanked regions of the world, such as the Middle East and Africa. As one final point, don't snub your nose at Visa's small nominal yield. The company's quarterly payout has grown by more than 750% over the past 10 years. The only reason its yield is so \"low\" has to do with Visa's share price rising by 927% over the trailing decade. Look for Visa to keep charging higher in the decade to come.",

Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Right now, a number of people are making the case for “just in case” inventory – or a return to the good old days, when you kept ample supplies of your products on shelves in warehouses and in the storage space behind storefronts. That was a time when someone in the supply chain, and sometimes more than one someone, had to pay for things even while getting no value from them. Along came “just in time.” For decades now, as global trade grew and grew and grew, as the Iron Curtain fell, as China (sort of) embraced market opening, as Latin America (largely) embraced market capitalism, all of which added hundreds of millions of consumers to the global economy, “just in time” inventory made opportunity for a better life greater for most and costs for most everyone lower. Things didn’t arrive until they were ready to be sold. The metaphor often used was keeping the sand out of the gears. Shoes and cell phones and motor vehicle parts and furniture and clothing didn’t need to sit in warehouses for nearly as long, or in the back of retail outlets. Around the world but perhaps most noticeably in the advanced economies, technology led by the holy trinity of computers, computer chips and the internet, brought incredible efficiencies to our daily work and personal lives, increased safety, improved health, and more.

[+] phones. ustradenumbers.com The prime example is our cell phones, which are no longer really phones in any real sense because they are so much more. We shop on them. We buy airline tickets, reserve hotel rooms, rent cars. We navigate on them. We email on them and text on them and video chat on them. They have flashlights and cameras. We read books and newspapers on them. We watch sports and movies, silly videos and serious how-to videos on them. We listen to music on them and podcasts, too. And they are ubiquitous in even the world’s poorest countries. Computers and internet access might not be quite as commonplace but they, too, have revolutionized the world – all made all the most affordable by globalization and its just-in-time delivery model.

With it come shortages and surpluses. Shortages of lumber and computer chips, of workers in automotive factories and on our docks and in our truck cabs. Surpluses of ships wanting to enter busy U.S. ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach but also on the East Coast, in Savannah. Surpluses of demand from U.S. consumers, buoyed by cash doled out by a government doing its level best to avoid a serious downturn – and an inability to spend it as easily on vacations and restaurants and concerts. Sand in the gears. Yes, the supply chain proved imperfect – but it took a once-in-a-century pandemic to lead people to question it. It had survived the global mortgage-led economic crisis of the previous decade and the 9-11 attacks from the decade prior to that. And it will survive this too, once we Americans decide we have enough stuff, or even decide to save a little more. “Just in case” might have its place in the short term but let us not forget how well and for how long “just in time” worked.",

This is partly due to the pair being the most successful clubs in the history of the English game with 20 and 19 league titles respectively to their name. Liverpool lead the way in continental competition with six European Cups to Manchester United’s three, but that haul is still enough to make United the second most successful English club in Europe’s premier competition, now known as the Champions League. But the rivalry is also one of locality and competition between the two cities . They are just over 30 miles apart but connected by transport systems and business links that can give this the feel of a local derby. Both have ambitions to challenge for the Premier League title this season, with early season form suggesting Liverpool’s will be the most serious and realistic of the two challenges to Manchester City and Chelsea. “United-Liverpool is a massive game obviously, we know that,” said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. “I think Man United are not overly happy with the results they’ve got so far, but we all know they are able to do incredible things—that's how it is, and we’ve seen it already.” MORE FOR YOU WWE Extreme Rules 2021 Results: Winners, News And Notes As Roman Reigns Beats The Demon The World’s Highest-Paid Soccer Players 2021: Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo Reclaims Top Spot From PSG’s Lionel Messi The Good, Bad And Ugly From The Green Bay Packers’ Win Over The San Francisco 49ers MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 20: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manager of Manchester United and Jurgen ...

That's because some of your costs, like healthcare, could rise as you age, while others may not drop the way you expect them to. It's for this reason that saving independently for retirement is so important. If you rely too heavily on Social Security , you could end up pretty cash-strapped. Of course, building a solid nest egg might seem like a challenge. But here's one way to make it easier – invest your money savvily. In fact, if you play your cards right, you can triple your retirement plan contributions and amass a nice sum of money in time for your senior years. Image source: Getty Images. Seamlessly grow your wealth The great thing about investing is that it allows you to take money you're not using and turn it into a larger sum. As you put money into your IRA or 401(k) plan , you should invest it with the goal of snagging as high a return as possible without taking on undue risk. To this end, loading up on stocks during your working years and shifting toward bonds as retirement approaches is a good bet. Bonds are a poor investment choice for your 30s and 40s because the returns they deliver may not be enough to grow your nest egg substantially over time. Stocks are, of course, riskier, but if you go heavy on them during your 30s, 40s, and even 50s, you'll have the option to scale back as retirement nears. Now, let's assume you're able to sock away $200 a month in a retirement plan over a 30-year period. Let's also assume that during that time, your investments generate a 7% average annual return. That 7% return is a bit below the stock market's average, and it also accounts for the fact that you may not hold such a large stock position in your retirement plan during your last few years of savings. If you save $200 a month over a 30-year time frame, you'll end up contributing $72,000 to your savings out of your own paychecks. But with that 7% return, you'll end up with about $227,000 in your nest egg after three decades. That's a little more than triple the amount you put in. Now, watch what happens if you only score a 4% average annual return in your retirement plan because you stay away from stocks and load up on bonds. Assuming the same monthly contribution and savings window, you'll be looking at about $135,000. That's a decent gain, but you're not tripling your money the way you would by investing in stocks. Put your money to work Some people who contribute to a retirement savings plan keep their money in cash or bonds and see minimal growth through the years. If you want to triple your savings, go heavy on stocks when it's appropriate and scale back later in life. It's a great way to amass a nice sum for retirement without having to sacrifice too much.",
